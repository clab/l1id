I do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today , because in western society there are a lot of resistences to the decreasment of cars .

First of all , the governmets and the cars companies do not support technological reserach on new means of transport or on new types of cars ( as electrical cears or hydrogen cars ) .
Although some scientific researches announce that petrol will finish in fifty yers or less , the cars companies continue to produce cars and to sell them .
Besides , some governments are supported by petrol companies and so they had to defend the interests of these companies .

Second , in a lot of developped countries the government does not implement the public transport service , so every person has got one ore more cars .
Third , the public opinion is not really interested in environmental problems .
If people really fought against cars pollution , governments would have been obliged to develop other technology .
In conclusion , I think that untill petrol resources are avaliable , the use of cars will not decrease .
Only when petrol companies really finishes to expolit all petrol , and that could last a century from now , other technologies will be introduced .
