I agree with the statement because i think that spots make his products seems better almoust always .
From the producters point of view it is a very good think because in this way they think that it is possibole for them to sell mach more products and so it 's possible to make much more money .

I think that this is not true in fact when someone goes to buy something because he sees that on tv or by some other kind of advertisiment , he mants to have that products with the propiety that were illustrated .

If he comes back home with his new object and whene hi tries it and it notes tha the propiety are not seems as the advertisiment 's ones , he is not sadisfaction at all .

When happens something like that the client will never buy again the same products and he will never buy anything else by the same factory .
For example : is Chrismas , you want to buy to your son a new toy .
You want to buy a small nice train that you saw on a tv spot .
it has the railyway station and it is full of lights .
the spot says that the lights turn really on .
On the Chrismas day you give your present to your little son and you say to him the the lights turn really on .
He is vary happy for that but when he trys to turn on the light nothing happens .

By now i 'm sure that you will never buy anything alse from the train 's factory .
For this reason i think that a producter have to make a real and true advertisements for his products , in this way people who buy something from him are sadisfy and so they maybe will come back to buy something alse from his factory .
