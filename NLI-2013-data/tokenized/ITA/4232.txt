Basically I agree with the statement .
In fact nowadays young people are not interested in helping their communities , I think because they are not sensible to the problems of thir community until the problem doesn ' t address directly to themselves .

Until they not have a problem in first person they are not thinking about the problems of other people and and think that community ' s problems are less important than their everydays life .

Often superficiality makes them to care about only of how to be happy or how to get fun or how to reach their personal objectives , not considering that communities ' problems may affects the reaching of their goals .

Furthermore the decreasing of the cultural and the intellectual level between young people detemines a lack of information and sensibilization about the communities ' problems .
So in many cases young people not even know what is happening around them , they cannot see beyond of their nose .

On the other side I have to say that this statement should not be generalized .
There ' s a part of the young people , unfortunatly not so wide , which spends a lot of time in helping the community , for example , volountaries , social assistants , or actuating a positive political activity in the school ambit or in the society .
They try to do their best to improve social conditions and to solve communities problems because they thik that is important to give their contribute .

In fact another probable reason for the lack of interest among young people in such problems is the considering these problem without a solution and the thought that their contribute would not be useful .

This is in many case the easiest and comfortable way of not taking our own responsbilities and fill not guilty for not taking care of problems which add
