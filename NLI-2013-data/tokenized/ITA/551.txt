the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialize in one spcecific subject '' because the person shold be specialize in a subject for better their knowledge .
A lot of reasons and example to support my answer .

Fristly , in the world of job the factories want the worker can be specialize to sector job .
Because the factories travel in the specific sector of buisness .

Secondly , person prefer specialize in one specific subject because thier like an determinate subject and want to work in a determinate sector .

In conclusion agree the satement that tock about to specialize in one specific subjet because the factories want the worker can be specialize to sector job .
In addition I like one subject and me specialize .
