I do agree with the opinion expressed in the statement .
In every day life is it possible to hear statements like that .
Simple statements not deriving for philosophical thoughts , just simple expressions of every day life 's observation .

I think that is possible to explain such a cliche ' giving some examples that truly confirm the point .
Young people have more time than adults to enjoy their life .
Usually young people go to school and have the opportunity to meet people of their age .
Sharing school-time make young people eager to play sports together , to go out at night together and enjoy life .

Adults usually have to think of their families , they usually work to earn the money necessary to feed their children and so they have less time to do what they want .
Adults actually do not have time to enjoy life .
Even if the adult is a rich person he has not the possibility to organize his life independently of his or her responsabilities .
As you become older you have more to accomplish in order to respect what people expect from you .

What I have just written could be contrasted adfirming that young people enjoy life because they do not know what life is .
Young people cannot see the hidden difficulties that everyone experiences in his life .
But we all know that sometimes is good not to know everything .
I could give also a personal example , when I was Ichild life seemed easy to me , I thought that could become everybody I wanted to , but now I know that real life is different .
To reach want you want to reach you need to forget sometimes friends , sports , and all other things that could help enjoing life .
As we all know , It is necessary for an adult person to find in his accomplishments and in his work the sources of life enjoyment .
If an adult learns to understand which are the important things in his life then he or she will enjoy life .
