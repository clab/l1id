In this period , it 's very important to try to do new things or new jobs because with the development of innovation there are less opportunities to become a successful person , and as a result only if you take some risks you will obtain some good results .

A good example of this theory is Bill Gates , that has used the innovation to become the most important person in all the world and now he can do everything he wants .
As far as I 'm concerned , I 'd like to have an idea like Bill Gates , because I 'm sure that this idea could be a solution to all my economic problems !!

But I also believe that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspects but also with some problems , instead if you want to become a successful man , the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend , because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money .
For instance , my father has done the same job for thirty years , and he has a very normal life , he helps me with the University 's taxes and he has lot of friends , but he 's too far to be a successful man .

In spite of it 's very difficult to be considered a successful person , there are lots of successful man in all the world , so I think that it 's not impossibe to become an important man , but it 's sure that if you do n't look for a new idea , you ca n't be considered like this one , so in conclusion I 'm agree with the statement .
