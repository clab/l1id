The choice and the preference between a broad knoledge of many acedemic subjects and a deep knoledge of a specific subject represents a classical topic to which it is difficult to give an answer and that involves , particularly , people who have to image , think and/or implement an ideal educational model .

According to the human nature and considering how spread and various it is , I think that a knoledge of many topics could be more coherent and offer a better level of satisfaction and benefits to everyone .

Focusing on many subjects , people have the opportunity to discover aspects of the world that otherwise they will never know .
Moreover , I think that a preference for a spread academic knoledge is also useful to develop complete and reasonable judgements about things that , coherently with the technical and scientific progress , are becoming more and more complex .

On the contrary , a specialized knowledge of one specific subject has certainly some advantages : for example , it allows to become an expert for some questions and probably to know some details about a discipline that no one knows .
But the risk is also that this knowledge is too much isolated , without sufficient contacts with other types of knoledge , sometimes and potential helpful also in academic field of interest .

On the basis of my considerations , but also considering the global movement toward an academic activity with a network frame , i support the opinion that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is probably more interesting and powerful .
