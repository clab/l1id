I do n't think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Usually , when we think to younger people , we imagine them in their life cycle span of adolescence and early maturity .
In this period of life most of them do n't work , they are economically maintend by family and they study at school and university .
Being a student offer the chance to know a lot of people , make new friends and increase possibilities to find a partner ; so young people have a lot of social interactions .
With all this mates they explore the world and live new experiences almost every day , for example their first tour at night without the presence of parents , the first party with both male and females , the first love , new strong emotions and feelings ; their moods vary continually and make their life full of excitment .
Looks that youth is best part of life but , personally i think it is n't so for two reasons .
The first because youth is also the most turbulent period of the entire life .
All the biological changes make the adolescent so insicure and from a psychological point of view he is so fragile .
Young people do n't only enjoy parties and free time but they also suffer a lot .
Frustrations , delusions , psychological complex lead the young to experiment a lot of pain .
The other reason I think youth is n't the most funny period of life is because every part of life can be funny , every period is important and has its specifical beauty , even senility .

This statement could sound too much rethorical at a first glance but I think it 's true .
Older people have other possibilitie of entertainment that youngers do n't have .
For example having a job and being retribuited can bring mature people to have much more money to spend for their hobbies .
And they are also more wise and they sometime know how to cope better with life adversities .
