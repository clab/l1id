I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
But this is my opinion , I think the common opinion of the customers ; in the other hand I have to say that the opinion of the people involved in the production of advertising is different .

First I want to provide my personal experience .
Two weeks ago I bought a personal computer of the last generation of computer .
The advertising was amazing , the quality of the screen and the powerful of the CPU showed incredible .
In reality it 's just the evolution of a normal computer , nothing of special .

This is just an exemple of a personal experience but I think that there are millions of customers in Italy that every day are pussed by the advertisemets to buy something that is in reality differs from what presented .

I have the chance to have a friend working in an agency that develops advertisemnts for both italian or foreign clients .
Her opinion is not in costrast with mine but she things that the problerms is not the advertisement in it self but how the people want to see the advertisement .
Her point is that the some customer needs to believe that a product can improve his quality of life and then he buy it , but , once he has bought the object , he realizes that his life has no changed and so he is not satisfied by the object .
At the end he believes that the responsible for his disatisafaction is the advertisement .

As conclusion I want to say that most advertisement show products much better than they really are , even if part of the responsability for an error in buying an object can in part due to the customers .
