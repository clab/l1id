The problems of the pollution is one of the most ones of this century .
One important cause of this problem is the substances that the car trasmit in the air and so it is necessary to find a solution .

According to me , twenty years are not sufficient to reduce a lot the numbers of cars but this is the only way to solve the problem .
In Italy the public transport are not already the best way for going somewhere .
A lot of students or workers have infact to use the car because the mean of trasport are not effecent or there aren t any .

To see few cars on the road so , the governament have to do a serious politicy to increase continuosly busses , subways ...
Nowadays in fact the traffic is getting higher and higher also because every family has two or three cars , to reach the place of work or study and only with adeguated and not much expensive means of trasport the car will left home .
So , as the traffic is increased from past to today , will continue to increase also in the future if the governament wouldn t be able to stop this cycle .
But also the behaviour of common people have to change to solve the problem .
If someone have to reach a near place may go on foot or use the bicicle instead use the car for doing 100 metres .
Moreover specially in the biggest cities as Milan , where the public trasport are efficent , people sholdn t use car to move in the city .

So , according to me it will be very difficult to see less car in the nex future because the goverman have not only to increase the public trasport but also to change the mentality of a lot of people .
