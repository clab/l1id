I haven ' t a specific position on this argument , because I think that is important in an equal measure how students understand ideas and how they learn facts .
I can make an example to support my answer .
Everyday we watch on television or read on newspapers that in some part of the world someone has been submitted because he or she wasn ' t beautiful , smart , free , cristian or not , and what we do to stop it ?
Nothing or at least we do a committee in front of some important departments of justice !
Words only words .
Using the right words at the right moment , it sometimes can be very useful and permit us to obtain what we want at the beginning .
But we usually don ' t make anything .
We rest to observe in silence the world around us .

To preserve and to protect our society , it ' s important , for a student , understand the origin of facts studying for example the history of his country - learn facts - , and at the same time , it ' s important to know ideas and concepts to understand the background of that fact .
