I disagree with this statement because it 's true that is necessary for students to understand better the concepts and the ideas showed from the theory but I think if students do n't learn facts and do n't learn the way in wich all facts are produced and could be solved , they are not well preparated for the daily life and for taking the work they are studying for .
Now I 'm going two show two examples about my life in order to support my theory .

I 'm studying Business at Politecnico of Milan .
All courses that I have done during my bachelor degree and also courses that I 'm making in my Master Of Science , spend so much time for showing ideas and concepts and not for presenting facts .

In one bachelor courses called ECT ( Economic and Technological Changes )
I have studyed a lot of theories , for instance the theory of Monopolio , Porter 's theory about the four forces that are important in the regulation of enterprice 's business , but our professor spent less time on the cases , on the reality .
The result of this course was that all of the students were n't able to solve a case studies and were n't able to solve a real problem .

I had got the same problem also in my MOS , because all the subjects that we have to sustain in order to take ours Master Degree provide only for a teoric preparation based on concepts , ideas but there is a great gap related to the understanding of the facts .

For instance , three days ago I have done an exam called Econometrics that is statistics applyed to economics .
But there were only models to write but nothing related to facts .

I think that for students , learning concepts and ideas is very important , in fact if they do n't have a great theorical base they ca n't give brilliant solutions to solve any problems .
But also is important that they learn facts , the way these facts are produced and the best way to solve them .
