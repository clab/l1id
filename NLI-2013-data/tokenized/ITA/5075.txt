In later years advertisenments have increased a lot , especially on tv and newspapers .
The most part of spots presents product or services in a way that can make them appear better then they really are .
Many and many tecniques are used to present products enphatising their quality : for example in icecream 's spots they use a camera recording at a very high fps ( frame per second ) and then play the spot at a lower speed .
Using this tecnique icecreams will appear to be more creamly even if they are n't really like that .

I completely refuse the trend to present products in this way .
In my opinion advertisements must present products or services as they really are .
Presenting products in such a way is also a risk for the firm : customers may be unsatisfayed by what they have bought if it is n't as the advertisement has presented it .
Probably they will not buy something from that brand no more .

I think that also governement should do something to stop this trend : for example the State should create a team responsible to verify if products are as they will be presented in spots .
If a product seems better that it really is , State should punish trasgressors with financial penalties .

Nowadays firms must create advertisements that present products better than they are because every firm do that and people will not buy at all products if they seem lower quality than others even from spots .

Firms could stop this trend by creating a team controlling all advertisements : firms produce advertisements the best that they can but presenting products as they are .
Before publishing advertisements the control team will check if the presentation of products is or not corresponding to real products .
If the check is positive , the advertisement can be published .
This is also a way to help customers to choose the best product they need .
