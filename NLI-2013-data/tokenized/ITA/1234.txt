It 's very difficult to state if it is better to have a deep specialization in a certain subject or instead to have a broad but more superficial academic knowledge .
Reasons for mantaining both positions are several .
Having a complete knowledge of a subject may bring to a full comprehension of what is under it .
It involves understanding causes and consequences of all principles included .
For this reason I think this kind of high quality specific culture may be very useful for investigation .
Research programs take advantage from people that have specific competences about the research objectives .
And it is surely from this people that further developements can come .

Moreover , I think that a strong competence on a subject may be a great personal satisfaction .
Knowing everything about a process or a specific matter would certainly create a deep satisfaction in a person , that in a certain way pays him back of all the efforts made in achieving it .

On the other hand , I think that a broad culture brings much more satisfaction to whom holds it .
It may be true that having many competences implies not to have very specific concerns .
But I think that knowing a bit of many things allows to understand better the world we live in .
I mainly think that life is n't all inside a research laboratory , nor all in a university .
In my opinion , meeting , exchanging impressions and relating with people is one of the most interesting things to do .
Having many knowledges allows to stay with everybody , without being exluded from any group .
It is true that in this way any subject will be accademically achieved in a complete way .
But the essential things that lacks may be aprehended from others .

In conclusion , I think that the advantages brought by a deep knowledge of an academic subject are not sufficient to balance the loss of many interests that this achievement would imply .
Spending the same amount of time , a person who goes too deep into a subject experiences a loss , due to the many other things he or she could have studied .
