In general I think that both understanding conceps and learn facts are the two faces of the same medal .
I try to explain here below all the connections between concepts and facts especially in science metters .
All the big science discoveries depends on the observation of facts , but on the other side is important to know all the theories related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of facts we are observing .

To give an order to this matter I think that first ( in a temporary order , not for its importance ) student need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts , so in the first part of students formation is necessary for them to learm as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the metter and after they can understand and remember much more easely all facts connected with their study .

for example if you are studying the atomic structure , of course you need to know everithing about the chemistry and related theories .
This example feats quite well to this assey especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission .

It happened that the woman , who was of course a phisycs and have studied a lot of theory , was observing the facts about accelerated neutrons pushed against the nuclear part of a not stable atom .

During the observation of the facts , she expected that , using enough energy , the neutron would link with the atom , instead it heppens that the atom divided producing a large quantity of energy , and thanks to her previous study she understand she had discovered the nuclear energy and atomic fission .

In last analisys , I can say that the deepest concept knowledge would be unuseful if it would n't be used to learn how all these theories are connected with facts , and at the same time it would be unuseful if we know a lot of facts but without knowing how these facts liks together .
