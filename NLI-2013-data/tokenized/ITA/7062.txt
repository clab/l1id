No , definitly I do n't agree with this statement .
I think in the future it could happen exactly the opposite in the usage of cars , and I 'm going to explain why I 'm sure of this .
In my opinion , the main reason among a lot of aspects , is the relavant explosion , in these years and also in the next future , of the asiatic populations , and , as a direct consequence , of the asiatic market in this sector .
In these eastern countries , as , for example , China and India , there is a big population that is in costant increasing of their birth , but , what is more important , is growing the level of their social and technological culture and knowledge .
It means that those populations , that together have a number of inhabitants which is about thirteen times larger than the one of United States , will create in all economic areas , and so also in car sector , a big market that in the next twenty years could only increase the number of material goods ( as cars , in this case ) which will be exchanged in the global commerce .

In this particular example , furthermore , there is another very rilevant aspect which can be affirmed to support my thesis : it is about the relations , in those eastern countries , between the population and the territory where thei live .
Although the number of the inhabitants is so high , the extension of the territory that they occupe is very big , and the need of movement from one side to another of the city it is a real aspect we have to considerate .
Nowadays this problem is not solved with an important solution , but it is reasonable to think that in the next years , with the increasing of the technological culture and possibilities , will be built more roads and than cars will become the only mean of indipendent trasport and movement .
