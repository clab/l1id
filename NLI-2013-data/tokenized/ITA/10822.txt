As a I learned during my sociology class , a successful person is someone , who has achieved important goals that have led him to important positions of success .
Of course developing new projects and obtaining positive results bring risks and doubts , but the only way to improve and cross personal limits , is to take these risks and solve them .
Someone , who prefers to do only what he is sure to be able to do well , is a person who will never become successful .

Nowadays , the working situation shows how always more companies are looking for employees , who have the following competencies > initiative , goal orientation , flexibility , self growth , and so on .
A candidate in a job selection must prove , that he is a person with initiative in developing new strategies , and improving the company-s performance .
A society will appreciate more a person , who demonstrate passion and interests in taking new challenges and facing risks , rather than someone , who does not want to improve .
No company will give a promotion to an employee , who does the same work since years , just because he is sure of doing it well .
A boss will give a prize to that person , who is able to develop new plans and positive approaches for the company .

On the basis of what I have just statet , I strongly believe that to become a successful person , I should try new things and take risks , showing my motivation to improve and grow .
As example , I can look at my uncle , and at his professional career .
He is now a successuful dean of a high insitute of business administration in Damascus , Syria .
Before having achieved this high position , he experienced delicate situations , where he had to deal with all those risks following a new project , such as opening a high institute of business in the Middle East .
The positive result shows how initiative can make a person successful .
