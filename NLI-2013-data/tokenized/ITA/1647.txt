In my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subjects .
It means to belong general culture that could be used in a day-life time .
It means you can speak and keep a conversation on differrent variety of topics with a lot of people , even if some of them are not belonging to your class or to your culture or religion .
Even to find a position on the job market is easier because you are not connected to specific competence areas .
In example I can mention the profession of the doctor and the dentist 's one .
Both have kind of preparation about medical notions and acknowledge of the human anatomy , but the doctor can choose his specialization after the study .
Before , he gathered many information about all the subjects of linked to the human body and then he will focus his choice to work in surgery , radiology , gynecology or any other department .

Dentist knows from the very beginning what will be work on and their studies are focused on specific subjects regarding the mouth .
And they will work as dentist , no other choice .
You are tied up to the formation you have received .

On other hand , having a specialized knowledge of one subject allows them to be much more professional in shorter time .
And probably to reach the goal before the others .

But in a world where every company has the need to get different his production , probably they will require a feature of suitability in the mind of their employee .
Passing through a department to another one with different tasks requires an elastic mind and could help you to better understand the interconnected problems between the production areas .

To conclude I would like to support my opinion with a strange personal example .
I am a n average player of many sports : tennis , volleyball , football , swimming and many oter else .
I am not a pro in anyone of them but I can continuously choose friends to play with .

Never saying , sorry : I ca n't join you because I am not able .
