I agree with the statement .
In the education of a child it is important to transmit him the knowledge of facts concerning history , science , art and other matters , but it is more important to teach him how to reason independently and to think with his own mind .

For a student it is very important to understand ideas and concepts behind facts ; in fact , this gives to the student some schemes that he can re-apply to understand many other facts and he can use to continue learn also alone .
Notions are relevant , but are ideas and concepts that develop in a young boy the skills required to analyze things and reasoning .

In the past to know a lot of facts was very valuable and esteemed , but today , thanks to new communication technologies , information and facts are easily available to everyone and have lost great part of their value .
For people today it is not essential to know facts , but it is required to have the capacity and the mind to understand facts and to find out what we really need among the big quantity of information available .
Internet today is maybe the gratest example of what I say : in the Web it is possible for everyone to quickly access to facts that happen in the world , to historical archives , and to a lot of pictures and video .

Ideas and concepts are also the basis for creativity ; discoveries in scientific areas can happen only because researchers have understood what they have studied , and have gained the capacity and courage to go further simple facts and to design theories and rules also concerning facts that have n't yet happened .
AOne affascinating example is A. Einstein : with his ideas he proposed theories that were verified by facts only many years later .
