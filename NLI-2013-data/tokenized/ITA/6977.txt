I agree with the statement and I think that it is necessary .
this is a serius problem of moder life because cities are dangerous and a car often are n't use correctly .
I believe that this change is necessary because the petroil is less than before and this natural resource has changed their would .
I agree with the statement for different reasons : Public trasportation sistem will improve , people use better cars and people will move less than before .

Firstly , I belive that we can solve the problem of trafic jam and others problems of their cities , we have to improve the public service .
In fact , In this way we will reduce the number of vehicles and use it properly .
For example , people will use the bus to go to their job , to do shopping or to do other activities .

Secondly , I belive that cars should be used better because , nowadays , a family have two or three car but these cars often are n't used .
So i thin that cars sharing should be a solution of this problem .

Lastly , i believe that in the future people will use less vehicle because they will spend a lot of time at home .
