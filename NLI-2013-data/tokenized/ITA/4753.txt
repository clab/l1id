I totally agree with this statement .
It perfectly reflects our society , which is based on appearance .
Today advertisement has become an added value .
It is something that some years ago we did not even have , but that today plays a central role in the society .
I am attending a Master in International Business and during this Master I attended a Marketing class .
Our professor explained us how advertisement is important today .
More and more societies spend huge quantities of money in advertisement , as they think it is a good investment .
And the results always come .
One example that can give us the mirror of the situation is given by the company Pippo .
This company produces low quality brushes .
Twenty years ago , it was just a small company and today it has become one of the richest company in Italy .
What the owner of the company did , was just to invest some money in advertising his product .
They used a very good strategy and they finally reached their goal .
They pushed housewives to go to the supermarkets and ask for the brush named Pippo .
They created , through an advertisement , value on a product which nobody had cared about before .
The worst thing is that this product has a very low quality and does not reflect the perception we have watching the advertisement .

One of the most important skill that people are required is the capability of selling .
I have done a few interviews in different companies .
In each one of them , people working in the Human Resources Department asked me to try to sell something that did not have any value .
They just wanted to see if I was able to do it , because today appearance is more important than the reality .
