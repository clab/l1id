For me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this wey we can have more possibiliy to change my life .
For example , I can specialized in one specific subject but the future can reserve me a lot af problems and so I can costrec to change my work and in this case it is very important have a big knowledge .
In fact , for your private live , a broad knowledge is more valuable than a specialised one .
A broad Knoweledge can halp you in a different situations , for example to try a new job .
For this reson , we must study a lot of subjects and we must try to have a big knowledge for all and different situations .
Whith a broad knowledge you can communicate with everyone about everything .
So it is very important read many newspapers and a lot of books .

But , it is important tell that in some case we can specialize in one specific subject .
But , in these day there is a specialist for everythins and it is not to easy to find a topic to do research on .
You have to knew everything about your topic and this is very difficult .

At the and , i think that a broad knowledge is better for all the people and it is very important .
