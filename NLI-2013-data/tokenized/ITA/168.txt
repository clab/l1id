in twenty years the number of cars is increasing .
i agree with this statement because is true that people have more cars than few years ago .
in my opnion the invention of the car was the most important invention in all the human life .
from the beginning of the twenty century cars became an important way to move but initially was used only by rich people while the other people used horses .
after many years this invention became so important that today is impossible to find a people that has not his car .
and this situation could be interprise as a positive situation because if all people has a personal car that means that all people has the money to buy and to maintan car .
but this situation in my opinion has also a important negative consequence , the consequence is the increasing of pollution .
infact few years ago the atmosfere was better than our atmosfere and people lives in a better world .
people seems that are not very interisting of this important aspect and this is a problem because thanks to the pollution a lot of people dies .
this is in my opinion the most importance negative aspect but there is also an other aspect that is important to analyze .
the aspect is the exagerated and eccesive use of cars and for this reason people never go out on foot or in other way such as bus .
go out on foot is important for people at all the ages specially for the adult that they work all the day so for this people is important to walk because helps them to think about their life .
so in my opinion the increasing of cars in this period is certianly a positive aspect because helps people to move in thei city but has also a lot of negative aspects .
