In our society advertising has become the morst important aspect of business .
Anywhere you go , it is possible to find any kind of advertisements that try to convince you to buy anyhting .
One one side of the street you see that the cheese produced by X is the most delicius and soft you would ever taste .
The advertisement would be for sure full of colour and happy people on it .
On the other side you might find another advertisement about the cheese produced by Y , and may be the colour of the poster are less bright than the other , and the people are less actractive .
So you decide to buy the chees from the company X , but once you open it and you eat a piece of it , it is disgusting and not soft at all .

Obviously you get disappointed : it was not what you were expecting .
But the envelope was very nice and colourful .
Some times advertisements promise you miracle : '' buy this wash machine !
All your shirts will be perfectly white , even if your child put chocolate and grass on it !
You will not have to spend time in ironing , because the washmachine will do it for you ! ''

So you spend a fortune to buy something that theoretically should make your life easier , but unfortunately you will soon find out that these were just words .
Most probably you will have to buy a new stock of T-shirts for your child and spend a lot of time ironing all the cloths .

We know that advertisements make products to seem much better than what they really are , but most probably we want to believe them becasue we would like to have an easier life , less frenetic and dreamfull .

Different companies , same product : they have to attract as many costumers as possible if they want to survive in the jungle of business , so they obviously have to exagerate the qualities of their products .

We can not blame them too much , we just have to be careful when we decide to buy something and not choose and item only according to its envelope .
