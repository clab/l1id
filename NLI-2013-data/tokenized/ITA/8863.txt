I do agree with the statements .
We need to start from ideas to draw our own personal conclusions .
I believe our mothers are our best examples , they tought us not facts but ideals , values , good purposes to that in our life we can use what we learned and apply them into actions and facts .
And we understood them as CONCEPT at firsta nd we applied them in our life seeing each day results .

The importance of facts in the process of learning it if of course crucial .
A fact that happens , especially if unexpected , can be a ` short cut ' to understan what thet idea or what the concept it is and how it is hidden behind it .

In general , i think the two parts are very much linked almost two halfs , infact i think that the first is very often the conceguence of the second .
Thus we cannot split them nor we should invert them .
To understand the power of a concept we need to see the facts that this idea produces as well as seeing a fact will make sense completely only when we can deduce the concept that sustained it ; by doing it i believe that what we learn will be stored in us as a complete information cause-effect and we will be able to recall it when a similar need will emerge in our lives .

That is the reason of why we study , eventualy to prepare us to the real world and to give us the capacity to overcoming problems and help us solving situations .

We can learn the trueness of this sentence considering as well how could i understand if a concept or an idea that by definition it is thoretical will answer me the same way
