Before to start with my opinion of the topic i must to say that in this life what is the much important thing of a product ?
So if we want to responde about this question we can tell that the image of a product it 's very important but it 's only a vision fact .
So I agree with the topic .

The advertisements make products seem a good image , so the people are involved to buy these .
They show us the best quality of products and not the reality .
An example is if you want buy a car you see that this car is the best for speed , or elegance , or horse power , or other characterists but you do n't see what is the consume , if the power of this car is economicaly good .

But the advertisments are in all our life , becouse if you watch TV shows or programs there are many break of advertisements , if you read a newspaper there are pages and pages of advertisements , when you go to work or only you go out in the streets you can see more and more advertisements .
So they are a subliminar message .
And the power of its is that can seem products better than really are .

However , the advertisements are most important for the economy because a good advertisements can make some profit for the industries .
But the buyers have one thing from their side , that the product is much far from reality they ca n't buy it .

In conclusion I 'm in accord at the topic but i tell to all the people of the world that not are impressionate for the apperance of an advertisement but see the really quality of products , that we can change something in the world .
