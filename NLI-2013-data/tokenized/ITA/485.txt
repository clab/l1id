Knowledge is important .
We all know it .
Nowadays , having a culture is needed to get a work .
It is surely not enough , but it is the first step to success .
The problem is wheter specializing or not .
Surely we have being seeing , in the past years , that employment market made many steps to specialization .
But , considering how fast competence gets old , we should take the decision carefully .

First of all , we have to say that a strong and various knowledge may help you a lot .
Knowing a bit of everything , or ecclectism , enables you with the so called flexibility , that at this time is truly imoprtant .
When you know a bit of everything , when facing a decision , you may have at least a little idea about where you are going .
Not a clear one , though , but you cane figure it .
This may be false if you have focused only on a subject .
You have reached the cutting edge of it but you completely lack in other things .
If you are in a statical environment , maybe you wo n't ever have any concern .
But there is always some risk .

I think we all should know about as much subjects as possible .
The most that you know , the most you can choose .
In fact , once you have tried a bit of everything , you can avoid things you dislike .
Furthermore , you can more likely avoid to choose blindly , because is well known that risks get bigger when you lack of informations .

Finally , once you have chosen your way , who blocks you from specializing on that subject ?
Training and training , your experience will yeld , but your eclectical knowledge will remain .
So , at the end , yuo may reach the same level of the ones who have chosen specialization .
But you will have more of them .
