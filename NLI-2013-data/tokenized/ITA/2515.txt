I do not agree nor disagree with the statement .
I strongly believe there are advantages as well as disadvantages in all phases of life , in youth as in old age .

It is generally agreed that young people have strong physical qualities , more energy , and a wide range of opportunities potentially available to them : their life is n't written yet .
At the same time , older people are weaker , need medical attention with higher probabilities , and do not have many of the choices young people have : because , as you grow older , it becomes too late to seize an increasing number of opportunities , and more doors are closed , so to speak ( in particular career-wise ) .

For example , if a young woman pursuing a career in acting and attending theatre classes , is struck all of a sudden by a revelation and decides her true vocation is in marine biology , she simply quits theater studies and enrolls into science school .
Changing your mind like that would not be possible when you 're like , say , 40 years old : no matter how hard you work , the competition will probably have been into your field for 10 or more years than you have , and that kind of gap is practically impossible to fill .
So , if you 're 40 years old and you 've been , say , a theatre actress , you 're probably bound to stay that ; or at least , you do n't have all the opportunities you 'd have had , had you changed your mind at a younger age : in short , I guess we can safely say that getting old reduces the opportunities of successfully changing your career field .

However , there are clear advantages that go with older age , such as security , reduced uncertainty about the future , the comfort of relying on a family of your own , and that feeling of safety that having a steady job gives you : all this is more likely to happen as age increases .

It is wise though not to generalize too much : in those countries where the job market does not present high levels of protection , job-security might be low for the old as well as for the young ; and when divorce is a popular behavior , your dream of a happy family can be easily shattered and turn into a nightmare .
