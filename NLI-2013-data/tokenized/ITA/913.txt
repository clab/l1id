I think the knowledge of a lot pf subjects forms the culture of each people .
A person with a certain culture who is involved in a discussion , is able to speak with others of several issues .
This means to avoid ignorance , and with this fact many purposes can be achieved .
Someone who has a knowledge of many subjects can speak of everything , not feeling submitted to anyone because of lack of informations , or because he doesn \ t know what to say .
This means people to feel more secure of themselves .
It is interesting to enlarge the knowledge of a subject more and more , but it isn \ t always possible because of time and costs .
So a person who is specialized only in a particular subject can speak only about that , feeling ignorant about the rest .
It is also interesting to improve the knowledge of several subjects in order to form our personality and to find always other things to disvcover .
If you only know a specific subject you don \ t know very much what surrounds you .
With the knowledge of only one subject , you know a little , if you know less specifically many subjects , you know a lot .
It is interesting to underline that a wide culture , the knowledge of many subjects , also gives people a sort of common sense , gives the faculty to understand properly what happens around them , something like consciousness .
In fact the most advanced countries have a school system that goes through the knowledge of a lot of subjects , and only after that they have something improving the skill that regards each person future work .
First of all you have to give the basis , then you can build something specific on them .
If there \ s a lack of basis , there won \ t be anything else .
