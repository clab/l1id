I agree with the statement .
Economic rules changed a lot during the last sixty years .
The arrive of television and the expansion of mass medias in general brougth to a different consideration of people forming a society : we 're no more considered as a mass of different personalities who must share rules to coexist , but also and very often only as a mass on consumers who have to buy the same products .
This brougth to a challenge to convince consumers to buy a certain product instead of another one .
To do this , advertisements try to make product seem much better than they really are , and expecially better than the direct challenger .
A typical example that comes in my mind referres to the Michelin tyres advertisement .
All over the world we can see advertisements stating that Michelin is the best producer for tyres and where is possible , the advertisement explains that Michelin in much better that Bridgestone , that is another tyres producer , directly challenging Michelin .
In the Formula1 championship , that is a race car championship , Michelin and Bridgestone face each other directly , since they are the only producers allowed to build those special kind of tyres that are required for Formula 1 .
In the 2005 Indianapolis Formula 1 Grand Prix , Michelin and Bridgestone equiped a different number of cars , as always .
During the racing weekend , a lot of Michelin tyres explosed , and only them : no Bridgeston tyres had problems .
Because of this problem , no cars using Michelin tyres could challenge on Sunday , during the race .
Only cars using Bridgestone tyres were allowed .
That was a perfect example that Michelin is not the best tyres producer as the advertisements stated .
Michelin , after the problems created , had to refund the cost of the tickets to the spectators , paid for the damages occurred to the teams and first of all , had a huge image damage , since every consumer could't forget what happened that year in Indianapolis .
