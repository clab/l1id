I think that nowdays there few young people that spend some of their time to helping someone else .
So , I can say that I am agree with this statement .
I do not believe that young people know that wrong .
In fact I think that is the society that grows the young people .
Everyday I see this lack of helpful in different situations .

In order to they think only to theirself .
There is not helpful and this is possible to view in our family , or in our communities .
When there is need to do something , young peolpe do not think .
Young people do not to be able to help their friend .
when there is a difficulties in a communities all the members try to resolve the situation but nowdays also the adults try it .

Young people spend a lot of time to play with their friends , to study , but always alone .
An example to explain what that i say is this .
Thinking about at the bus stop , there is an ancient woman that has some difficults to take the bus .
Near to her there is a young boy that sees her but does n't help she to take the bus .
Indifference nowdays is at the basis of our society , and this is very afraid .
There is n't comunication in our society : internet , the tv , has modicated our maind and all seem to feel as a fiction .
Return on the principies that must stay at the basis of a good society is very important .
Nowdays also in our family we can see these situation of no helping .

Helpful should return at the basis of our life because it is better to give that recive .

Society must changed for a better future .
