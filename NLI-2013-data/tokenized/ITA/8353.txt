i disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
i think that to understand ideas and concepts is very important , but i think also that to learn facts are not less important thant ideas and concepts .
they are at least at the same level .

i think that ideas and concepts are at the base of a theory and so they are at the base of our knowledge , but sometimes facts can replace and modify the original theory , so it is important to know real facts !

In Italy there is a famous affermation that is `` la migliore teoria e ' la pratica '' that can be translate in english with `` the best theory is the real pratice '' , and i think that this affermation represent perfectly my opinion .

In our world there are a lot of jobs that need a lot of experience , and experience can be `` reached '' only by facts rather than with ideas and concepts , that they are also important of course , but without facts nobody can `` reach '' an high amout of experience .

Another example is a normal math exam : to prepare a math exam we ca n't only study theory on the theory book , we must do a lot of exercise if we wont to understand how the theory is used in realty , or at least how the theory is used in the exercise that will be in the exam .

in the end , I dont know if my thought about the importance for students to learn facts is condivided by all other people , because I know that there can be a lot of people that thought that is important only to understand ideas and concepts , but that is my opinion and I think that is right .
