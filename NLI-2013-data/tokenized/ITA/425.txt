I partially disagree with the statement that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because I think that both the ideas expressed in the statement are important and that one idea does n't exclude the other one .

In fact my opinion is that is very important to have an idea and a minimum knowledge about many academic subjects .
That 's an important thing because everyone should know almost the basis of general culture .
I think that is n't a good thing when someone do n't know anything about one or several aspects of culture , for example about history , geography or science , also if the same person know very well one aspect in which he is really interested .

It 's normal to focus our attention , energy and maybe also all of our life about the things that we really consider important , but at the same time we should mind that these things are fundamental only for us .

For this reason it 's important to be informed , at least a little , about all the aspects of human worldwide society .
But at the same time it 's impossible for someone to have a very deep knowledge about all the subjects that could be studied .
For this reason it 's also important the existence of people who are specialized in only one subject .
For example I think that people who study something like science could n't make new theory if they should study with the same attention they use for science all the other subjects ( like history , language and philosophy for example ) .

I think that unfortunately it 's impossible to know everything .
For this reason we should focus our attenction about what is really important for us but at the same time be interested to all the other things that appear everyday in the world .
