We live in a society in which the enterprises and the industries can product everything becouse they reached a very important technological level required for the production .
So their problem is how to sell their product .

To aim this pourpose , industries use the powerful instrument of marketing .
They have to convince people to buy their products instead of the products of the others .
So they use the promotion to show their products to people through tv , paper , radio etc .
Then now some societies have been reached a great visibility and these are well known by people .
So costumers known what they want and what they want to buy ; they want to buy the producted that they know and that they have watched on tv or seen on a poster on some walls .

But most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In fact , many less industries , to be able to sell their products , use all the systems to product with the minimun costs .
So the quality of their products is not so good .
So to hide the low quality they use most advertisements to seems their products better .

I think that advertisements are important for a society to show its products to people , but i m even sure that if the product doesn t satisfied him , the costumer will not buy it again .

Then i think that this fenomena had brought to another dangerous problem , the counterfait .
The societies that promot the counterfaited products use the advertisements of some grat industry to sell goods with a very low quality .
