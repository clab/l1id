Of course I completly agree with that statement .
I think that in life everyone MUST have high ambitions , but the realization of personal scopes and ambitions dipends in a large part on the ability of everyone to take risks and try new things .

If a parson who wants to have success in life only does what he/she already know maybe he never became real leader in his own business .
That 's because everyone has to wrong for deeply learn .
Of course if there are no risks there are no mistakes and if there are n't any mistakes nobody can obtain a real knowledge .
The real knoledge is based on two fondamental points :
PERSONAL CULTUR , ACADEMIC AND THEORIC KNOLEDGE and PRATICAL EXPERIENCE .
they are both fondamental : the only theoric knoledge or the only pratical experience are not enough .
For example I 'm a good students , I have good marks and a good theoric knolendge , but if I want to have success in the future this is n't enough .
In fact in ten years I see myself graduate but also working in the field I 'm studying for .
I see myself at the head of my own business , I do n't care if small or big , I just hope it could be active in organization of cultural events .
I said that becaouse even if I will be graduate with excellent marks It will be very important for my person and my careear to do experiece in the `` concrete world '' .

In fact I imagine my self travelling around the world , surching for new experiences , and new sources to organise very original a particular events here in Italy .
this is very important do give relevance to the years that I spent at school at first and and at universty after .
This is tha only way to have success in life .
