First of all i do not agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy their life more than older peolple .
I think that the way to enjoy life is different but this not imply what the statement says .

Today young people can enjoy in several ways , respect one or two generations ago because is permited almost everything : for example have the car very early , to go out every weekend and spend a lot of money to take drinks and to go to the disco with some friends .

They can also enjoy themself organizing some party between compains of school or university .
A friend of mine told me that he went to Danmark as erasmus student and he descibed me that experience as a beautiful thing .
Every day he enjoyed his life going to erasmus party that took place almost every evening in the university place .
He told me also that the mainly enjoy it was the beer and the disco .

In stead , the fact that the older persons do not do the same things it does not mean that they enjoy less : they have only other interestes .
The major part of older persons are married and for this reason the prefer enjoy their free time going , for example , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaurant for a romantic dinner .
Of course many older people could have son or daughter and this imply that they do not have the same time respect the young people , to spend for enjoy themself .

The have to do a lot of thing into house and at the work .
