I 'm sure I can say I totally agree with the statement .
In fact it 's the reason why I choose a course of degree that cover a lot of different subjects .

I think one simple ( but not so stupid , i suppose ) reason is because studying a lot only one subject can easily become very very boring .
I ca n't immagine to pass all the years of the college studying all the aspects and features of the same subjects over and over again .
I 'm sure that this way one will become a great expert of the subject , but i think in the end he could even begin to hate it , unless he is totally fond of it .

Another good reason to achieve some knowledge in at least more than one subject is that you can never know what life 's deserving to you .
One question : what if you ca n't find a job that 's concerned with that subject you have studied ?
It means that you are really unlucky , but it could happen .
One extended knowledge in only one subject means that probably you are very little competent in any of the other numberless subjects that exist .
With an academic preparation that covers a lot of different subjects , you have at least medium-to-high skills in a greater number of them .
So on your curriculum it 'll written that you have matched during your academic carreer a number of subjects , meaning you could more easily find a job in a variety of environments ; after all , I think , you can achieve the real expertise in a field of knowledge only with the direct experience on the working place rather than with the academic studies .
I think this is true at least for what concerns my biomedical engineering studies , I 'm sure that the knowledge of chemistry , physics , mathematic , biology and medicine that I 'm learning , although they 're not totally complete will help me in future finding a possible job in a number of biomedical applications .
