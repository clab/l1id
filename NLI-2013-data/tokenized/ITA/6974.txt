In my opinion in twenty years we will see more and more cars than we can see today .
Today we have big pollution and enviromental problems and we experience every years dramatical disasters but actually i think that this would n't stop the trend to have even more cars circulating around the world .
I am not happy about this , i am only realistic .

Emerging countrys like China and India , that were really poor any years ago , are now growhing incredibly fast and they needs a lot of resourses and transports .
They do n't care ( for the moment ) about pollution problems , they wants cars .

For the moment i do n't see a valid alternative to cars .
It could be that in future we will assist at a change in the material that give the power to our cars .
The oil resources is another important problem thesedays but the technology progress is running fast and maybe in twenty years we will put water in the fuel tank .

Someone could think that with the spread use of computer an the presence everywhere of the Internet we dont'need anymore to go away
