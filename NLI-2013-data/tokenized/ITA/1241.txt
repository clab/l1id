In contemporary society , specialization in one specific subject tends to be the most common thing .
Some people spend all of their lives studying a particular year of the life of a king , or some kind of abstract things related to an unknown topic of algebraic topology .
This kind of people tend to extremely focus their point of view on a single topic , and to examinate it in every side .
I think that such an approach to an academic subject is a bit limitating .
In my opinion , one should have a broad knowledge of many academic topics , rather than fossilize himself on a single point of a matter .

First of all , I think that everyone should have a personal amount of knowledge , and be prepared at least on the basic things .
Everyone should know , for example , that the earth orbits the sun and not viceversa !!
Some people , instead , may know everything about the poetry in South Italy between 1900 and 1910 , but ignoring at all such a basic thing .
This is rather an extreme example , but it is what happens in practice .

Another point pro having a broad knowledge of many subjects is the fact that there are many things that diserve to be studied .
The world and human history are so rich in beautiful things , that I think it is a crime to not take them in consideration .

An objection to what I am saying could be made : such a way to proceed , that is to fly from a flower to another like a bee , could lead to nowhere .
Acting this way would bring nothing more to society .
No improvements can be reach .
My opinion is that to invent something new , it is necessary to grasp relationships between things .
For example , it is the contrast between Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism that lead to the theory of Relativity .
No one would have though to Relativity if thinking to Classical Mechanics or Electromagnetism separately .

For this reason , I think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .
