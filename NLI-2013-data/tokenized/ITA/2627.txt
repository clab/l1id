Although many people think that only during youth we can realy enjoy life , I do n't agree with this statement and i will now give some reasons to support my idea .

First , i think that in the last years youngh people do n't have any more time to spend in enjoying life .
The stressing course of moden life do n't allow them to stop a minute and taste it .
Indeed they have to study hard and a lot to be able to find a job .
on the countrary retired people have a lot of time the they could spend by making holidays or just doing what they like to do .
For example since i was ten years old , i dream what i will do during my retirement time because since that age i have only studied to manage to succed in my future job without , thus , having the time to enjoy the best year of my life .

Second , i think that even though many physical problems add gradually during life time , they allow old people to do what they want .
Nevertheless these physical problem are n't invisible and with the pass of the time they become a problem , sometimes a serious and bad problem .
However , as cicero said , the age is n't a ill .
Indeed if physical problems come inesorabily nevertheless they take with them more wiseness .
an aged people is wiser than a young people who ca n't understand the real and beautiful meaning of some little action or experiences .

In conclusion i think that old people are able to enjoy life more than young people .
Indeed they are alble to know the real sense of life thaks to their wiseness .
On the contrary young people stop to the superficial and physical level without achieving the deepest one .
