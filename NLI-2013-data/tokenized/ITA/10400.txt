I think that a person who wants to be someone has always to make important decisions and take risks doing choises .
He has to start from what he knows , but he has to try something new to be satisfied and to achieve a great success : this is what makes the difference bettween normal people e succesful people .

In the past much people had taken risks and thanks to them now we can turn of the light , write on our computer , take a plane or drive a car : if the world look only at the past and people live without try to discover something new , the future will never come .

A person 's success dipends on the ability of looking at the future and understanding what the future hides ; if there 's no one who wants to do somenthing new and everybody continue to do what we already know , there will be no success and no innovation and the world will never change .

Even if I agree with the statment , I think also that the present is important too and is unusefull try to do something new without know how to do well what we just know .
I think also that is important take risk to achieve success without damaging anyone : so it 's important that everyone tryes and takes risks using coscience .
