I am not really agree with the question .
In a first view it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They take all their life with a smile on their face , they are happy for all thinks also for a stupid thinks .
Young people have not a problem , they depend of their family , their parent , they are `` on the clouds '' .
Young people enjoy themselves with the major stupid thinks , for example I have a brother that is 20 years old and he with him frinds laught for all thinks , they enjoy with videogames , they spend all day play football or gooing away .

But the difference about the older people is not that the older people do not enjoy life , they also enjoy life but in a different way .
Older people have a big thinks to resolve , they have a responsability of their home , they must pay the telefone , they must cook the dinner also for their children that could be outside playing with their friends .

Older people have less time than the young people have .
They have all day full , they can not enjoy life if not during week_end and also they have a different way to enjoy their life .
When you are old , after 22 years old , you look to life in a different way than when you were 16 years old .
You have a different way to enjoy life .
For example now I am 23 years old and I like to do different thinks from 5 years ago .
I enjoy my life going to mountain and looking with my boyfriend the landscape or to go to eat , in a famous restaurant , some good fish drinking a good vine .

So I think that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I think that cahnge the way in which young people and the other do that .
