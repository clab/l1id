It is commonly stated the the only part of the human life when you can enjoy yourself is when you are young , and several writers and philosophers wrote about that topics : actually I do n't agree with this statement for two main reasons .

In the first place , asd they feel to have plenty of time , young people usually can waste their time in something that later can reveal as something trivialor not worth doing .
I remember having spent entire days watching tv , alone in my room , rather than going out with my friends for a walk , or to have refused to practicee a sport just because I was too lazy .
Now that I 'm busy and I do n't have spare time , I really feel as I had waste my time .

On the other side , young people have to think seriously about their future , and in many cases , in order to accomplish their objectives , they cannot waste time or money to enjoy life .
For example , if you are studying at University and want to have good results , you have to sacrifice your time to study , or , even if you have plenty of time , you do n't have the money to enjoy yourself .
If you want to marry , you have to save money and this means that you have to sacrifice many pleasures of life .

On the contrary , older people can frrely enjoy their life : at the present time , while I 'm busy studying in order to enter in my PHD program , my parents are travelling around the world with their friends and enjoying their hobbies .

I think they are really enjoying their life , not only beacuse they have gained , after years of sacrifices , the time and money to do it , but also because they have the capacity to recognize the things that the really can make their life pleasant and worth being lived .
Consequently , they are able to place everything the right dimension .
I think it is possible to gain this capacity only with experienceand in some way , both young people wasting time and young peolple sacrifying themselves for the future can later become able to fully enjoy the life .
