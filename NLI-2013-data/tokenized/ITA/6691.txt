I disagree with the statement because in my opinion this fact will not realize .
Because of the pollution , that exists in amount of quantity yet , the Governaments will take misurs of security .
The situation today is yet dangerous because the cars in use are millions and millions i the world .
Even if there are better situations like in Holland and in other northern countries the situation is dramatic .
In these countries , life is more natuaral than in other countries like Italy , because abitants usually use bycicle to move .
They prefer this way to the car .
In Italy , for example , don-t exist this attitude and this education for all or about all .
But according to me for the nearby future we , humans , will arrive to the point that we will have to constrict to use public service even if we don-t want or other services will be invent to permit us to move without car .
The essential problem is not the car like object but is how and what it uses to go , gasoline .
With the many wars of today , this element is another enormous problem , for example .
Yet this is a problem .
For these problems I think that Governaments will do laws or other things with the idea that today will not be the future .
In this way cars demand will be less than now but only if the Governament will know how to fight all problems to garantee better services than today .
An idea will be the sostitution of gasoline with a material less dangerous to the environment .
This can cause less pollution but we need resourses for this new gasoline .
The facts are difficult for us , people who live in different cities , what will be the better thing to do , especilly how will be our reaction at this changement .
I don-t know , but i hope in a positive
