I neither agree or disagree with the previous statement ( or better I recognize its unavoidable reality ) , I will provide below my reasons ; I do n't appreciate this practice , even if I understand the reasons which lead the advertisers to adopt this technique to promote products .

The first reason is simply practical , many products do not look as nice in reality as they appear in advertisements , for example as regards pasta , usually experts use plastic copies of pasta in the making of their video advertisements , because pasta is difficult to be managed and to look in an acceptable way for the long times needed to record the videos .

The second and main reason is cause of marketing , people working in this field believe and know that people do not use a product because they need it , but because it represents a dream , an illusion , under which something else is hidden : the individual need to be socially recognized , the need to look in a better way , the need to look someone else , etc .

So usually advertisements depict an illusory image of products , full of colours and brightness , with dreamy contours , in a rich and pleasant environment , etc .
For example if we consider a car 's advertisement , we could notice that we do not see only the car , perhaps moving on a street , usually we would hear a very rithmic music , after we would see the car , perhaps in front of a luxury restaurant , a man in an elegant suit would come down and open the other car door to allow a beautiful , sexy , girl to join him entering the restaurant , perhaps at the end we would see the couple , inside a villa , on the border of a pool , drinking two glasses of , seemingly , champagne , naturally the car is always in front of the view .
Does this all reflect the real life of most of us ?
I would say no , but it reflects our dreams , our hidden desires of social power and recognition .
They do n't sell a product , they sell a dream .

Concluding my discussion , I think that the topic the question is about , better looking of products in advertisements than reality , depends on the way our society is structured , a way in which appearences predominate on essence ; so I think it 's just inevitable , it is not a matter of agreement or disagreement .
