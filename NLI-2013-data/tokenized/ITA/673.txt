In the past in each scholl or university there was not specific subject , but the students had a knowledge of many subjects .
Today the number of course at university are increase because they would people specialized in one specific subject .

In my opinion is better to have , in the first year of study , broad knowledge of generic materials , than specialized in one specific subject .
In this method students are increasing their culture in their material very rapidly with very strenght ideas .
Another point of this system , are that could incresing new post of work and new type of work .
To complete my opinion , I agree to spend part of study for stage , it is more important because it is between study and work .
In summary today students can specialised in one specific subject , but the world of work remain too far , during this specialisation .
