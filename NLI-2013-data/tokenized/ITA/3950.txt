I agree with the statment that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
If I think about my past when I was younger .
I can remember the idea that my friends and I had about helping our communities .
We used to spent at least few hours a week to provide services and help people that were in some kind of trouble .

Naturally our help was related with our age , but it was a good way to teach us the sense of community .
Nowadays I can see in many different occasion that young people are more selfish , they think just about themself and what is the best thing to do just for themself .

During last years I have never met a young person that was giving some of his time to do something helpfull for the community .
In our modern society there are many thing that everybody should do for the benefit of our community , and some of them should be done expecially by young people .

For example they should spent part of their time staying with old peolple and help them .
I think this is a good way to learn the history and get a sense of responsability .
I remember that I used to do that expecially with all my grandparents , and I learnd many things from them .

Nowadays young peolpe prefer to stay with their friends maybe waisting time or doing something really useless .
Probably there are different reasons why young peolpe have this kind of attitude , but I think that the most important reason is related with their parents .
I think they forgot wich are the most important values in a sociaty .
They also did not teach what a kid should do for his growing and how relate with the community .

I am sure that if I will have a children I will teach him how to give his help to his community and how to relate with it .
