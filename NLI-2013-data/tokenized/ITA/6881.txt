I am agree with that and I hope is going to be in this way .
It depends to us , what we want to do about our future .
We are living in this world and we have just this world , but the problem is that we are not living in a sostantable economy , we cannot go on in this way and base our society on the oil because the oil will finish .

So I think it is time to have a world wide energetic politic that think about the future and not just about today .
I know that it is not going to happen soon , because money are more important that the environment , but everybody can see that the clima is changing .
For examples , anybody knows that you use the termomether to misure if you have the flu or not and you can do the same with the world : the result is bad because the temperature is higher than the past , that means that our world is sick .

So , what I hope is that in the next years all the cars that use oil will disappeared and instead of this traditional cars we can move with hidrogen or electrical cars .
It will be a world with less cars and more trains and shared veicholes .
It wo n't be an easier or more economic world , but it will be cleaner for sure .

It is time to change and everybody cares about our future , so for this reason it is time that all the government of the world start to think about that and not just to have a better future , but to have a future that permit human beings to live in a safe world .

I know that it is just a dream and nothing is going to happen in the next twenty years , but I know for sure that I am not the only one that think about that .
I think we are growing and we are convicing other people that we are still going in the wrong direction .
