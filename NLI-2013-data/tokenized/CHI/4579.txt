In this competitive world , lots of company are rised and lots of company are disappeared .
Some company , in order to make a great amout of profit , use unethical way to produce their products .
I really agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Some examples will be showed in my essay below to prove how much i agree about the statement .

Almost every day i will watch TV show and follow by a huge number of advertising which are shampoo , conditioner , bank , restrant and more .
The one i think most attractive is `` VS '' , which company made hair shampoo and conditioner in Britain .
In this advertising , every model 's hair will looks very shinny , soft and healthy .
I tried one set of this production , after i used them it was good , my hair are soft but not shinny .

Another advrtising i want talking about is restrant .
Everytime i saw the advertising about the food that Drogen Restrant made was nice and delicious .
Their pics showing their food in the nice color .
And the restrant looks in the pic are big and nice .
But after i tried this restrant , i can say i do not want try again .
The food are aweful and restrant are small ..

As a conclusion , company now used all their ablities and incomes on their advertisings how to attract more customers .
