Everyone lives in a communty that consists of peoples , In which , all the people , old and young , are supposed to join the community activities , and to help their community in many of aspects .
However , nowadays , It is argued that young people do not contribute to their community than in old days I agree with this opinion , since I believe the young people do not have enough time , do not have enough chances to communicate with others in the community , and also lack of the good motivation to help their comunity .

First , the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before , they have to work very hard to compete their peers , which make them really lack of time to have other activities insteading of working or studying .
They spend all the time in the classrooms or office .
And even when they go home at night , they will be so tired that can only go sleep at home instead of going outside to help their communities .

The other reason is that , nowadays the communities in human society seem have less chance for the people , especially for the young people , to communicate with each other .
For some stupid reaons , such as security , all the buildings in the cities are built like prisons .
All the doors are locked so firmly that even the mice could n't get in .
The people living in these `` prisons '' are usally not familiar with their neighbors even their are living in the next doors .
This makes the young people do not consider their community as their own , and thus might not show up publicly so ofte .
That 's why they do n't even have the chnace to help their community .

Finally , the people of all society , including the young people of course , become less and less motivated to help their communities .
As the economic development of our society , the people more and more focus on money as the value of the life , while disregard the good reputation they might earn from the society .
Usualy the young people will obtain nothing except some apreciation form their community if they do contribute to it .
This make them feel valueless to help the community , and thus spend less and less time to take part in the community activities .

To summerize , the young people indeed contribute less time to help their comunities , and I think it 's the problem of our cultrure nowadays , which actually encourage the people disregard their communities , and do not allow the people have enough time to paticipate the activites of their communities .
I think it would be better for our future , if the young people can do more for their coummnities .
