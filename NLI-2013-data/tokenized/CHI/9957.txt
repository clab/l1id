As the modern society is highly developed , the market is highly developed .
Some peole may think it has many oppotunities to get money from the market , then people try to form their own business to reach their goals that get money from the market .
Some people believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , but their thoughts are wrong , it is not wrong with people try new things and take risk with it , because when we are doing our business , we need the courage to do things and take the risk of it if we believe in what we do is right .
They are wrong because they do not know that the successful means , successfull means that people do well job on the things they are doing , not simply the new things .

People success in the area they know very well .
There is one Chinese people , he collect the bottles from garbage to sell in order to feed himself .
But he has some money , he tries to hire other people like him to collect bottle for him .
Then he get enough money to build a building to collect the garbage and sell the garabage which can recycle to the company , after years of hard work , he accumulate millions of dollars , people call him `` The King of the Garbage '' .
At the beginning he can not even to feed himself , after twenty years he become a person who have millions of money , this is called success .

I think people need to do things thy already know
