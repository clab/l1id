That 's a comlex question to answer .
Mant peoplle believe that the young enjoy their life more than older people do .
They have so many reasons and examples to say this .
Such as young people have less experiences of the society and world surrounding them , to them .
everything to them seem to be a new challenge , that will arouse big interesting of them on these new chanllenge , they will ask so many `` what '' and `` why '' , and they will try their best to discover these `` what '' and `` why '' without considering it 's safe or danger , good or bad .
They just enjoy the progress they made through the discovering the new things .
Further more , young people have more time and energy doing a thing than older peopole do , they do not afraid of failer and danger , they think they can conquer all the difficulties they faced and finally get to success .
To the older people , it 's totally different .
older people have experienced so much , and many thing to them seems like nothing but repeat , they have no couriosities on what they meet and hear , they think that everything routine .
What they do everyday is just a routine , everything happend on everyday is like yestoday , it 's boring , .
So they will not enjoy it .

I agree with the first opinon
