In my opinion , in some situation it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while other specific circumstance , people need to specialize in one specific subject .

For example , If I plan to go out for a camping , It is probable that I need much more knowledge from different areas , such as geography , some of the medience skill and a good sense of surviving knowledge .
To learn knowledge form a broad part will help me to solve the problems which we will catch in any delimma .
In addition to this , it is better for people who learned many skills to find a descent job in the competitive job market .

On the other hand , If I want to fix the broken television , I need to be control professional and accurate electronic and mechanical knowledge , thus helping me to recover the television .
Especially , in the part of advanced techonology area , most scientists must study in a potiential degree that help them to create the new things .

Different job also need the knowledge different .
For a saleman , it is more than possible that they should learn a broad knowledge .
If a salemae study phychology , marketing and business , it must have a big merit than other people .
They can sale too many thing than the people who not know broad knowledge .
But as a teacher , they should specialize in their subject , so that they can teach students professional and accurate knowledge .
But the students would be better to learn broad knowledge in the school , they can find their interests on some subject and develop it in the future .

In conclusion , the knowledge for people whther learn broad or specific is depend on their situation .
If people can control the good scale on that , they must be successful in the future .
