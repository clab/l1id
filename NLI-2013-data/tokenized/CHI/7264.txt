The best ?
I do n't like say that .
It meybe is the best way sometimes but not always .
Because we have some different ideas when we locate at the different age .
So travling with a guide or not depends on the period of our age .

If I was a child or teensage now , I 'd like to find a guide to describe the cultrue of some spots .
The reason is that , I have much less knowledge about some famours places .
So travled with a guide is very necessary for me to learn new things .
Also , traveling with a guide is a comfort way because I can save time and money to find the spots and buses which can lead me to the porpuse place .

But , if I am a university student now , I will choose to travel myself .
Why ?
Because I have had the capable to do something on my own .
For instance , if I want to go to Yunnan , I will find some relative informations about that place from the Internet .
You know , in the morden world , Internet is a perfect source for out younth .
So traveling alone is much easier for us .
So , do n't you think it is a good decision ?

Then , if I am a old lady who have had not ability to walk along .
certainly , the best way to travel is led by a tour guide .
The reason is that I can get some essensial sevice from the tour guide , such as helping me to walk , introducing some spots to me aloudly and so on .
Something look much foolish but are all necessary .
Because I am a disability one and need more heart kindly .

So , traveling in a group and led by a guide depends on the concrete situations .
But , traveling in a group is the best way to make friends who have the same interst with you .
I have some friends who traveling with me to some spots , and I found that we all have the similar interests at some aspect .

Hence , leading by a guide is the best way to trave sometime , but not always .
