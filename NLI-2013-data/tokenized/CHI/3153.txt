There is not doubt that whether young people enjoy more than old people do has become more controversial in today 's modern socity .
As a matter of fact , this issue deals with a lof of different aspects .
Specifically , there are no universal answers to this question .
Depending on different elements such as social influence , personal interest , education background and etc , the answers of different people may vary greatly .
As far as I am concerned , I vote that yong people do not enjoy life more than old people .
In the following paragraphs , I would like to explicte my view from several perspectives .

In the first place , the important reason in support of my view is that young people encounter more or at least the same amount of the physical problems than the older people do .
Both scientifc study and empirical experience show us that physical problems are in propotional to the technologies levels .
Therefore , with these problems , young people have to deal with these new problems before they can enjoy their life , namely , they will not have the same opportunies to enjoy life .
For example , with the Internet invention , young people have to deal with all the techincal problems in constrcting the network or in maintaining the network .
But , for those older people , they can enjoy their life without thinking how this new monster brings about the c .

In the second place , young peole have to bear more social burdens than the olde people .
Social burdens manifest themselves in terms of social changes .
For today 's young people , let 's say in china , the society is pentrating into an aging society .
With One Child Policy , the country will say one young couple have to sustain at least four parents or their family members .
Accordingly , young people can not have much time to enjoy life as the older people do .

In the third place , admittedly , young people could face more opportunites to leave a happy life , for example , the joy that Internet brings us .
Some people , accordingly claim that the yong enjoy life more their older peers .
Here we part company .
They igonre the important facts that the the appearance of Internet is only the result of modern technologies .
As a result , young people have to handle all the brand-new challenges that the older people are never facing .
We can not lost sight of the obvious deficts that those people hold their conclusion .

In conclusion , the topic that whether young people enjor life more than older people do will be continuously argued .
However , as the comprehensive stuy discussed above , I can safely draw the conclusion that young people do not enjoyb life more than older people do .
