I agree with the statement that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

The advertisements including not only those on TV shows but also on the newspaper .
The perpose of these advertisements is letting the customers think the products are good and want to buy them .
The perpose made the advertisement do these .

In order to let the customers think the products are worth to buy , what they need to do is to show the product is good enough and worth them to buy .
The advertisement has to make the product looks better than other similar products , then they have to made up things to show the product is better than others .
This is the reason why the products seem much better than they really are .

In China , the advertisements make the products looks like they were perfect are normal .
There are many similar products in China at the same time .
Making the products that thay sell looks best is the most important thing to make their product sell well .
For instance , I bought an expensive pen which it said will nerver broken under any condition in the advertisement on TV .
But only after three months that I found the pen was broken already .
I found the seller to ask for return .
The seller said something that made me understand the true propose of the advertisements . ''
Do you think there will be a pen that never breaks in the world ?
I do n't think so . ''
She said to me in a smile . ''
All the advertisement do these , not only us . ''
From that on , I do n't believe any advertisement anymore .

There are more than one example can show that the advertisement made products seem better than they really are .
Base on my own experience that I can tell the statement is true all the time .
