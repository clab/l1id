In my hometown today , it would be difficult to get home timely after work , since the traffic is so horrible that there is no day without a traffic jam .
The over amount of cars today should take a big response to the most traffic problems .
However , I do agree with the statement that hte car number would decrease great in the next twenty years , for the following reasons .

First , the sense of enviroment protection is growing more popular today .
We can see a lot of slogans and programmes on TV about the environment protection .
Besides the way of broadcasting , many other ways are emloyed to get this idea into the mind of people .
For exmaple , in the last month , my community has held a competition in the knowledge of ways how to protect enviroment .
A majority of people in my community took part in this competion , from which we not only have learned a lot of knowledge , but also carried a nition to make less polution to our mother land and rivers .
One demonstrated evidence of this claim is that I began to notice how the car would do ill to the atmosphere , and started to recommend my friend to buy cars with less oil consuming and less gas exhaut .
In the next twenty years , I believe that most people would take a stong opinion against the car driving , especially against cars with big oil consming amount , so they would prefer to take other vehicles instead of cars .

Second , with the development of technology and with the bigger budget in the traffic , I hold the opinion confidently that that public traffic would be improved in a great extend .
For example , the light railcar which is now available in the big cities , such as Shanghai and Beijing would be available to most citizens in cities of China .
According to my own experience , it is much conveniene and faster than any other traffic vehicles when travelling in the center of cities , including cars .
Adding with the point that it can carry a huge number of people , light railcar would certainly be a good replacement to cars .

Besides , with an eye to the rapid innovation in every aspect of life , there is great possibility that a new kind of vehicle would be produced .
In conclusion , although now in many places , the number of cars are still increasing in a fast pace , I hold fast to my position that the number of cars would diminished considederably in the next twenty years , with the increase of civility and technology methods .
