I think helping students to understand ideas and concepts is important .
That is not the only way about how to teach students .
The other idea is teaching them to learn facts .
Students may get many different ways of education when they start to learn .
No matter the educators are the parents or the school teachers , the different ways will influence students so much .

Lead students to understand ideas and concepts is a very important way .
This way will help students to learn how to think .
If teachers teach students to understand the ideas and concepts of one topic and teach them to think those concepts more detail .
Students may use various kinds of ways to realize that topic , like finding information from the books or discussing with other students .
Students will develope the real thinking in this process .
This way even can help students to develope their creations and also learn how to use the good interaction with other people .

The other idea is teaching students to learn facts .
Most of parents or teachers usually use this way .
They will tell students which is right and which is wrong directly .
Students knows the facts of everything they have learned .
They always accept what they learn .
Students do n't need to think too much .
That will cause students ca n't differ what is the truth if no one tell them the facts or when they face what they have n't learned before .
That will be a very dangerous way to educate students .

I think the good way of education is teaching them to understand ideas and concepts .
Students may really know how to learn more and can think everything independently .
