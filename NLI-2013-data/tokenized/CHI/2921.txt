I think young people can enjoy life more than the older people .

Young people are living in a better living condition than older people .
I think my living condition is much better than my parents ' .
Now I have better houses to live in which always with air conditioners and heaters .
That makes me fell more comfortable than the houses my parens used to live in .
The housing condition can affact one 's health and felling .
I do not have the same health problems as my parents .
My mom has very bad backpain because when she was young , she used to sleep in the very cold room without heaters during the long winter time .
So now she can not enjoy her life like I do .

Also the young people have better place to go .
Now we have many beautiful parks .
We can visite there whenever we want and do a lot of intresting things we want .
We can take our kids to the park and let them play by themselves , While we can enjoy ourselves by chatting with fridents or reading the magazines we like .
The older people did not have chance to do such things .
They had to stay at a limitated area .

Young people have a lot of new entertaments .
We have new games to play on the computers .
We can enjiy
