I think I agree with this statement .
As far as I am concerned , I think that there are two ideas which can support this statement .
First , recently environmental protection awareness has been rising rapidly .
People nowadays realize that ailr pollution is getting worse and worse because of cars .
Thus , in order to give thier generations a better environment to live , people may begin to decrease driving cars to the places they want to go .
Insteaed , they will start choosing public transportation , such as MRT , tran , and bus , to get to the place they need to go .
Moreover , the payment for a car is not cheap at all .
For example , when you get a car , you have to pay for the oil and repairment .
I dare to say it will cost you much money than spending money on taking public tranportations .

Second , oil is becoming less and less though scientists have done thier best to dig oil and find where oil can be .
Oil is one kind of natural resources and the formation of oil must be very long , so it is not limtless .
However , oil is essential for cars .
Without it , people can not start cars at all ; then , people will reduce using cars step by step .

I think that the above I write can explain why there will be fewer cars than today .
Just remember that quantity of oil is limted and one day it will be gone , and the government have spent amouts of money on establishing public tranportations .
Where do the governmet get the money to create pubic facilities ?
It is from peolpe who pay taxes .
So , we , people , have to enjoy what we have invested and keep a better lives for our next
