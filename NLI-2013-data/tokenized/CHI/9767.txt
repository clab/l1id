I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well .
Successful people always try new things because they can see the long view in their eyes .
Why they will want to try the new things ?
This question is similiar as why people will creat new things which old people never imaging befor .
It is because people all need to grow up .
How can we grow up ?
If we always do some thing we alreafy know how to do well , can we grow up ?
It is n't said do the old thing is not good at all , we need to do that but succeessful people will do that when they take risks .
So what will succeessful people do ?

Succeessful people will try some difficult things they never do .
Maybe they will fall down but they can learn a lot form ther fall down .
For example , a man always play foodball in high school , he was the team 's leader and many college invide him to go to their school to play foodball .
He go to one of those college and he have long vacation during this time .
What should he do ?
Play foodball again and again ?
No , he use this time to study by himself .
He know he can not play foodball forever so when he have time he work hard to study .
In the end of story , he transfur to another famous college to study commurce .
Is he a succeessfull person ?
He make coise to study when he is free because he see the long tern in his futhure .

People always do some things their already know because they are afraid .
They afraid their will do wrong things .
Succeeful people will take risks because they believe even they fall down they still can learn a lot that help them succeed .
