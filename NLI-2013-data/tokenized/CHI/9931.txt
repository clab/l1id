I agree this statement .
First , successful people has his success from his adventure .
Trying new things and taking risk are very important success factor for the people .
I think it means a great oppturity for people to get the success .
Sucessful people never worry about the fate in the future .
They have strong confidence to support their action .
Thet will keep the action until they get success .

Second , if a person only do what they already know how to do well .
They will not find some fresh and excited thing in his life .
The people will tried to do the repeated job .
I think people will become lazy if they always do the same work .
They will not find the happy or proud from the work .
The people will get less competition thinking .
Maybe they will result in a really faiulre in the future .
So , it is very important for a person to get the success by trying new things .

Third , new things and risks means new chance .
If you can catch it , it will bring more success for people .
I think it is a importart part for the definition of success .
Anyway , peopel can learn more ability from these new things and risks .

Many examples can prove the point in business today .
For example , GE , Mirosoft Company , and Intel .
