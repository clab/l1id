I really think that students can acquire knowledge because they can understand the ideas and concepts .
If we only learn about the facts , we cannot get a full picture of the knowledge .
We can only understand parts of the materials that we learn .
Therefore , I think that to understand ideas and concepts are more important than to learn the facts .

The first reason is that if we can understand the concepts , this can reinforce our knowledge .
For instant , we know that we need to wash our hands before we have our meals .
But , why we need to wash hands .
I f we understand that our hands are full of germs , we need to wash hands before eating so as to reduce the chance of getting sicks .

The second reason is that facts only teach us things in one incident only .
However , we can learn many other facts providing that we understand a concept or a idea .
Let us refer back to the example of washing hands before meals , we know that hands are full of germs is a fact .
We can infer form this fact that we can reduce the chance to get sick .
If we understand the concept then wemay know that we need to wash hands before we touch a wound .
They share the same concept .

These are only some examples of the advantages of understand ideas and concepts .
I think we can really get more improve in our kn
