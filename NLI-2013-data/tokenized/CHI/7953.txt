I think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First of all , because to tralve in a group is usually organized by some touring company that designs a guide , one can save time and energy for searching flight tickets , reserving rooms in hotels , etc , in particularly on one 's busy working schedule .

In addition , one may not familiar with the areas one is going to visit .
It is easy to get the information from the guide .
This is beneficial to know something about places one want to see in advance , which makes one get more impression and enhance memory .

Moreover , while traveling , the guides will provide introduction on what one is going to view , for example natual scenics or historic buildings .
They should know more that travelers .
By doing so , one can increase knowledge and avoid the situation in which one does not know anything but just look .

Finally , to tralve in a group provides one the opportunity to make more freinds .
People travel together , live in the some hotel , have the same schecules in activities , which makes people in the group contact each other all the time along traveling .

Our family likes to travel on weekensd or in holidays .
We perefer to take travel in a group .
In this way , we can easily get tickets from traveling companies on heavy traffic days .
The tour guide is available to give us more information we do n't know before , which argment our knowledge from travel , especially for our children .
And also , we established freindship with other travelers , whom we still touch now .

Thus , traveling in a group is the best way .
