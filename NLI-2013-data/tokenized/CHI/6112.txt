Will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
I agree so insofar as with the rapidly development of new technology which could reshape the way people live the life and people communicate with each other .
However , in thougfull consideration , I think that there will increase more cars than there are today concerning with the increasing wealth of individuls and the seperation between working area and living area .

Admittedly , with the complete development of public transportation system such as the development of underground transportation , the system will obtain larger capacity , which would be a replacement to the use of cars .
However , according to statistically survey , there is also increase in population .
On the other hand , the development of Internet will reshape the way people communicate with each other , which mean that people have not have to commuincate wiht each other through public transportation , however , it does not mean that people will replace traditional way of communicating .
Some important conferences must be held face - to-face .

Futhermore , I agree with the statement that there will be a increase in cars due to the increasing wealth of individuls .
It is human natural to enjoy the achievement of wealth , so , in this case , people will intend to buy some staff such as cars to encourage themselves .

The second reason why I think that cars will be increase is involved in the seperation between the working area and living area .
Assuming the case that you live in a town nearby the city and there is no other transportation tools like subway or buses .
You have to buy an cars in order to arrive the place you work on time .

In conclusion , I think that with developement of new technology , it will allievate the pressure on trasportation , However , cars will continue to increase becasue of the spout of population , increase in wealth and the seperation between working area and living area
