I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Many companies will do any possible things for their advertisements to make their products much more popular in the society , but do not care about the real value of the produsts .

There are millions of kinds of advetisements on TV , radio , newspaper , magzines , or even mails .
These various pictures and commits of the products are seemed much better than they really are .
It is because that the companies want to make their products more popular in the society .
For instance , BurgerKing will make advertisements to show how healthy their burgers or frech fry are ; however , the fact is that any junk food is no good for health .

The advertisements about toys are the most popular one on the TV , since kids can not read yet and the careness parents always make their kids ' requirements come ture ; the companies of toys are make millions of cartoon characters or games which based on the cartoons every year .
But sometimes the real produsts are not as valuable as the commercial shows on the TV .
It means that the companies do not respect the consumers ' rights to purchase right and great products .

On the other hand , advertisements of mechane of shape wonderful body are always fake , that nobody could just use the mechanes for several months to recreate their bodise which heritate from their parents .
According to the health knowledge , a person 's body shape determened by the heritation from his/her own parents ; the excercise can only help the person to make his/her body much more healthier and stronger .

Thus , most of the advertisements contain many fakeness , people should be aware about the negetive effects of the advertisements .
Meanwhile the companies should carefully think about the real purpose of making advertisements .
