Along with the development of human beings ' society , more and more products are in our lives for people .
It leads to the development of advertisement industry .
Someone said that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
I do not agree with the statement .

Firstly , advertisement industry is a huge industry controled by governments .
And the medias for advertisements are also controled by governments .
There are many kind of organizations to check and exam them .
The advertisements should be killed and cut down if they put some false words or mislead customers on the advertisements .
In addition , the products on the advertisements would not be selled and the factories or conpamies will fall down .

Secondly , the purpose of advertisements is to let more and more people to know their products and buy their products .
For example , many kinds of factories to produce cars .
Different people like different styles and different styles are suitable to different seasons and roads .
People do not know how to choose and which one is best for themselves .
In this case , advertisements are very important .
They help people to choose and make their final decesions .

Thirdly , the standards of product checking or examing are same in a country , even around the world .
For example , food 's standards are same in the food industry .
When a advertisement for a new style of food will be on the public , the food and medicine office will check and exam it before it is on the markets .
The food would be produced continuously if it could not be passed the checking or examing .

Based on the above statements , we can safely draw the conclusion that most advertisements make real facts about the products because most factories and companies want to keep their factories and companies developing and make more money .
So believing advertisements and buying accodring to your need !
