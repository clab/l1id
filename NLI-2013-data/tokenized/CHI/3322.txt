In my opinion , I do not agree with the assertion becasue there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities .

With the advent of Internet or other media , people have become easiler to get information that their community need them to help .
For example , in my apartment , the memebers of commitee announces the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up certain event .
And they often receive a lot of responses that say they would like to help .
Comparing to the past , there are few people informed that they are needed to help something .
Thus , I contrarily think more and more yound peole involve in community activies becasue they are more familier with the internet than the people before , and understand they are in demand .

In addition , in my shcool , university always encourage students to do something that can benefit our community or society .
For example , they are encouraged to clean the streets and help teach older people who are illiterate to read .
University do not pay the student that do service for community .
Nevertheless , many students often come to sign up for doing this kind of service .
Perhaps they will receive award , such as a certificate or a mendal instead of money .
But after all , they do involve in and understandour society and community .

When you broaden the scale to our society , you can also see that there are more and more institutions which encourage young peple to help disable people .
For example , in my country , we have `` Sun Shine '' gas stations , which only hire disable people and young peole who are willing to help those disability .

Inconclusion , I think that we have more chances for young people to hlep our communities becasue there are more ways they can choose to serve their own communities .
This can be seen whether at shcool or our society or even in an apartment comunity .
