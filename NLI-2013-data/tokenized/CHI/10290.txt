I agree with the following statement .

Why the successful peole are success ?
Because they would love to try the things that never happen before .
Then they succeed and these new stuff let more and more people interested in it .
The ending will be lots of people want to work with you and it will be developed .

It 's pretty hard to do a known thing .
There has already been some people getting knowledge and doing well .
In some way , it 's hard for you to do it better .
Because the people , who has already known it , their next step will be to do it better .
You just start it .
That 's not impossible to do it better but it cost time .

If you use the time to do some thing new , it 's much better to another way .
Finding some things new is liked a travelling .
You can feel many new feeling and get more express that never happened before .
Then , more and more people will be interested in your travelling and join you .
It will be developing .

But anyway , there 's still some problems .
Because it 's a unknown stuff , no one has experinces before and you must be your alone when you were starting it .
It 's so difficult that so many people failed .
You will face a lot of challenges and fight with them just by yourself .
Maybe some one will laugh at you or you will lose yourself in the finding way or you will enter to a dark land .

Yes , it is difficult .
Also it 's the why you succeed .
It means you are better that the loser in this way .
You are the winner .
You are succeed .
You will get some honors and prize .
But the greatest things you got that is the knowledge and express and how to deal with these challenges .

To do it .
