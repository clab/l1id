People seldom agree with each other , even on the slightly issues such as if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Few people claims that young people are more awared of how to enjoy life than the older people do .
However , other people have completely different ideas , they believe that older people enjoy life more than younger people , and that is also my point .

Always , young people could hardly be satisfied .
For instance , young girls always not satisfied with their beauty and young boys often think they are not strong enough .
They do a lot of work to `` perfect '' them selves but in vain .
When they are faced problems or decisions , they are always hestitaed and could not stop looking for a perfect solution until they are completely tired and feel frustrated .
It is unuseful for them to enjoy life .
By contrast , older people have experienced some frustrations and therefore are more easily satisfied than the young people .
Older people know that no one could be perfect and we should learn to endure the disadvantages of the others and ourselves .

In addition , older people always have a better financial condition than the young people do .
Young people , for instance , high school students still need parents to support their daily life , it is hard for them to enjoy life without their parents ' financial supporting since they do not earn that much money .
For instance , It is hard for young people to go to a foreign country for travaling if older people do not support them to .
However , employed older people do not need to worry about the finance resource , they could enjoy themselves anytime they want .

In summary , older people are more easily satisfied than the young people do , which makes them relax and enjoying life .
They also have a better financial condition , which make the range of enjoyment larger .
