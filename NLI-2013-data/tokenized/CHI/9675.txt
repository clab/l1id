Generally speaking , there are various types of people in this diverse society .
Some people tend to risk in order to become a successful man in the world , while others are afraid of risking and trying new things because they worried about losing their money and possesions .
But personally , I agree people should try and risk new things in order to be a successful and well-know person for the following reasons .

Most importantly , people who like to try new things tend to have more possibilies to success .
In other words , they might find out something that they are very good at and start to do other things they are talented .
To give a personal example , two years ago , when I was in Saint Andrew-Sewanee School , a very small private school in Tennessee .
I took calculus course , which was extremly hard and I thought I would do terrible on that semester , as oppsed to get an A on it .
However , after I tried to study several times , I found out it was not as difficult as I imagined .
I studied hard and got an A on every quizes and tests .
Needless to say , my semester grade was an A. Consequently , I started to have interests examing the math world beyond calculus .
Now , I successfully become an expert of math due to the fact that I took risks to take calculus two years ago .

In addition , people would more likely to learn the old experience and invent something great by trying the new things .
If you keep trying new things , you would learn the experience why the old methods is not working and would find out the new method that would make it work by continuing to try .
For instance , Edison , a great inventor in the United States , invented a substance called `` light , '' which is one of the useful and neccessary items in the world nowadays .
During his experiment , he had failed to find the correct metals that would make a substance lighten .
However , he did not just five up .
Instead , he kept trying new trails and new metals thousands of times .
And eventually , he invented light .
This is a good example that people would likely to be successful by trying new things .

Ultimately , some people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , whereas others would rather try new things and take risks .
Of course , I sometimes would review what I already know .
But most of the time , I always like to try something that are unfamiliar to me .
