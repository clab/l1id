Have you ever bought something dfferent from the fly ?
How do you feel when this happened to you ?
As a matter of fact , I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because of the developement of technology , businessmen like to use technical ways to make their commercials look attractive to customers .
Why I agree with the statement is due to the following reasons .

First of all , in my opinion , businessmen realize if they want everyone to buy their products , they ought to have a good advertisement because human can be attracted by nice pictures .
For example , I like to eat instant noodles and one day there was a new flavor coming up and when I saw the commercial on TV , the noddle looked like very delicious .
However , after I bought one pack of that instant noodle , I tried it and I found it did not tast like the one I saw on TV .
I was upset about that .
Thus , making a good advertisement is a way that businessmen like to use to attract people .

Secondly , in term of busin , advertisements are considered as the best ways to sell products .
For example , my friend is running a carpet company and before he opened this company , he was asking me for setting up a website for his company .
Ultimately , I did a great job on the task that he assigned me .
When he saw the website , he told me it was incredible .
Moreover , because of this website , he got many customers .
However , in hindsight , the pictures that I put on the website look much better than they really are in that I use a very good camera .
Therefore , advertisements are the ways that businessmen use to sell products .

In conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because customers are attracted easily by those beautiful pictures .
Furthermore , good advertisements are also used by businessmen .
In the end I would like to summarize my argument by emphasizing that do not buy those products if you do not trust the advertisements .
