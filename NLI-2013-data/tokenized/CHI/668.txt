With the development of scientice and techonlogy , people pay more attention to the education .
In today 's society , wether we should learn many subjects or not ?
Some people thinks that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I agree with this opinion because it can improve and extend prople 's knowledge and people should have many interesting subjects to catch up with the development of society .
But others do n't think so .

The first reason can support my idea is that people acquire more knowledge from different subjects .
Every body knows that different subjects have a few relationships .
When you have trouble in one field , you can change your mind to use distinctive method from another field .
If you do n't know other knowledge , you may give up the questions or waste a lot of time to think about it .

The second reason is that we should keep up with the development of society .
Nowadays , many employ need the compound person that have broad knowledge .
When the employ fire some person that useless , they will fire the person that have learned one knowledge or skill but learned many skills .
For example , If you can speak many kinds of languages , you will find the job better than person that can speak one language .
That 's the different .

Otherwise , people that learned one subject have some benefits .
Such as ,

In conclusion , I think that people should learn many academic subjects .
Because it can extend knowledgr and keep up with the development of society .
