I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of two reasons .
Here are my reasons .

Firs , if one person does n't want to give his enough time to help other people that means he is selffish .
I jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company .
In my opinion , If there are two people at the siminar work position .
The better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people .
The God always helps the one who loves help other people .
The one who loves pay more time to help people .
He will get the feedback of others .
You never know when will other people feedback your help .

Once I worked in a local campany , but I always help people and do some volunteer works on patient group .
Till I want to work at a Global company .
Some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company .
Give enough time to helping communtites not only gives me peace , lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world .

Second , I can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger .
This big gap brings some public security problems .
The rich person affrid to be hostage , the poor people do n't have money to give their child well education .
Why do n't we give enough time to helping our communities ?
Give the poor person help to educate , get work and resept .
We will not have much more public problem .
Moreover we will feel happy and lovely .

According these two reasons , I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping communities .
Young people are like sponge .
What you teach them what you earn .
Moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other communities .
Give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to makes our world better and lovely .
