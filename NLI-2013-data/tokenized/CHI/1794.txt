Today , the world has become a huge `` amusement park '' for the young people .
No one can denie the fact that the young generation is really enjoying their lives .
Nevertheless , did the elders hide in their rooms and never come out and have their own fun ?
I believe the answer should be `` No '' .

All of us could not refuse to admit that the daytime indeed is the `` amusement park '' for old people .
It is not impossible to see parks fill with happy old people during the day while their children are at work .
They can certainly enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air during daytime or sit down in a bench and chat with each other .
There are no working troubles , no compitition , no anxious feeling about want to do about their own future .
Recently a research about satifaction of people 's life have been made in my city and the result shows that among those who are 100 % satisfied more than half of them are over sixty years old .

Such as human nature , young people would take response for their parent and make sure they are happy about their life .
In my community , it is really common to see a great many old people walking with their grand or great-grand children , smile on their face .
And the movie ` On Golden Poud ' did show the enjoyment of the elders with their own children .
We have to accept the fact that being with their children is the most enjoyable thing to do .

In conclusion , the old people could easily get protection from the society and their children while they do not need to face the matters anoying us every day , their life with grand children could not be happier .
So I disagree with the saying that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
