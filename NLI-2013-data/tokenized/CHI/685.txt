When it asked which is better , exclusive reading or inclusive reading , however , people rarely come to absolutely consensus at such a controversial issue .
Some people attach more improtance on the broad knowledge , But as to me , i can not accept the statement state above .
Because the argument is too extreme .

As far as some subjects concerned we need to focus more attention on the specific subject and think it deeper .
Those more concrete ones like , biotechnology , agriculture , medecne and so on .
These subject require more related information about it .
Subject like medicine need not only aboudant knowledge but also adequate experience .
The following example that is a persuasive one .
Imagine that , what will happen if a doctor focus more attention on economy instead of patient and medical books .
The concequence is definitely undesirable .

Not doubt broad knowledge is very significant to some scholars in specific realm .
For instance , some subject , such as those abstract ones , like history , philosophy , politics , administration , archeology need a wide range of knowledge .
These sort of scholars expecially in the field of administration , should have more common sense than the other subject , because when face with difficult situation they can make a fast decision base , all these need more comprehensive learning of some knowledge such as history , economy , politics so on and so forth .

According to what have been discussed about , i believe this question is depend on personal inclination .
