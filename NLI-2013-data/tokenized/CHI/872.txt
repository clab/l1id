Many people think it is betters to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
There has tow reasons that i choose this one .

One reanson that is broad knwoledge is very important for us , if we want go abroad .
We should have a lot of broad knowledge to gain our personal knowledge .
We always stay in China , we have not know a lot of others country history , and this knowledge are still very important to us .
If we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects we can solve many problems , and we can aslo help others .

In another hand , broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more interesting than any other knowledge .
In China , many students have no chance to learn some other countrys knowledge .
Than always listen to the teachers and take note without any personal ideas , this problem has becoming harder and harder .

The reanson why i donot choose to have specialize in one specific subject is that i have one experence .
When i was 11 years older , i 'm interested in computer science , and I do a lot of time on it .

Althought i have known many knowledge on it , I get bad score on other class .
A student who have broad knowledge of many academic subject can easily take part in a new student envrionment , but a student who have specialize in one specific subject just can do one thing that he or she can do .

According to this above , I think a student had better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
