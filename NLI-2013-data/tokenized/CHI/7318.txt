As matter of fact , the issue whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a complex one .
Different person has his own oppnions according to his background .
As for me , I would like to agree that the best way to travel is travel alone , but not travel led by a tour guide .
The following discussion will provide evidence to support my claim .

First of all , travelers could have more flexible time to operate without a tour guide .
Because if travelor follow a tour guide , it means he entered in a traveling plan made by a comany , it also mean that all the attractions , time , restaurent are scheduled and fixed .
So , the traveler can not do anything just follow the schedule and lack a lot of fun .
But if the travelor have a trip alone , it can easily change a plan .
For example , if we find another attraction during a trip , we can easily stop to see it .
if we like to chinese food , it is ok , we can enter a Chinese restaurent instead of KFC , Burger King and so on .
Do n't you think the example quoted above could reach the conclusion that travelors could more flexbily opperate time according to their likeness and dislikeness .

Secondly , travelers who take a trip by themself without a tour guid could exercise their abilities in organizing , planning and preparation .
If the traveler take the trip alone , it means that he need book the hotel in advance , organize the route and so on .
But if the traveler enter a group led by a tour guide , all he have to do is following to the guide .
For example , i took a trip to Washingtone DC this summer .
At first , i have to book a hotel , and then prepare for the problems and plan for the travel .
After all this done , I feel that my ability of planning is improving .
That is great !
Do n't you think ?
Thus , the example persuasively illustrate that travel alone help much in personal ability .

Admittedly , travel alone without a tour guid has it 's own demerits .
since travelers are usually familiar with the place that they are going to , it could cause a lot problems such as lost .
However , the advantages of travel alone weight much than disvantages of that .
So the it is more striking conclusion .

To sum up , due to the discussion mentioned above , the reasons which combined together could be more persuasive than any single one .
It is more comfortable for us to claim that the best way to travel is travel alone .
