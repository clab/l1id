I disagree `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
The reason why i disagree this statement .
Because i think we should try our best to do anything .

First , i think we should try our best to do anything .
For examplan every people will watch tv and do same thing on the tv .
It mean people try new things and take riseks rather , but they only doing what they already knoe how to do well .
This is no good for us because we should learn a lot of knowlegder and history .
Than we can communicate with other people and understand what people talking about .

The other point is about we should learn and find a lot of information each day .
If we donot understand something we should find someone to help or we can go to library to find some information to help us .
Although if we always try something we know and donot try something we donot understant .
It will make us look like childer .

The other points is about we should learn something diference school than we will grown up .
For exampla , environment , relationship , history sush as those .
I always try my best to anything , if i donot how to donot something i will ask someone who know that and let them help me .

However , i think people try new things is good but people always should try to learn something thety donot know .
That is best than only learn they konw .
I hope even one can do this .
If you can do this thing you will try you bert more that befor .
I hope each one can do that .
