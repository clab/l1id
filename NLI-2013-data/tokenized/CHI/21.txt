As we all know , different people hold different views .
Whether one would choose many academic subjects or one specific subject to study , each would have its advantages and disadvantages , its benefits and drawbacks .
Thus , a good argument could be made for either .
As for me , however , I definitly prefer to have broad knowledge , so I agree with the statement .

Granted , a number of people of people study a special subject such as scientist who may during their whole life , the reasion is they really love the subject deep into heart .
Also , these people do a parament promotion to our society .

On the other hand , however , living in an ever-accelerate society , we , it seems , can never avoid being influenced by information .
We have to receive thousands of news or handreds of words everyday .
It makes me belive that without a broad knowledge , we could not even communicate with others , not mention to survive .
What is more , as the reason of the society is so rapid pace , most of people may change their works in the future .
Thus having broad knowledge of manyacademic may adopt the new jobs in a short time because of they have know how to deal with the things .
For example , an increaing number of people who change their works more than once a year .
Why they get other jobs so easily ?
In my opinion , they all have broad knowledge and strong ability .
Last but not least , students may have more motivition to study more ragion of knowledge .
In my point of view , most of students like the intigratited knowledge , may be two or three subjects , sometimes evenmore .
That also can expand their horzion and get a world wide knowledge .

In a word , in spite of the fact that there may a couple of disadvantages of study many academic , I still feel that the advantages are more obviously .
Take into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
