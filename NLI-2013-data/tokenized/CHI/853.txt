In this issue that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , I largely agree with the issue , in other words , I mainly consider that having broad knowledge is much better than just focusing on one specific subject .
There are some reasons why I support this assertion .

First of all , in this morden and mechanical age , I do not think that a person just know only one specific subject .
Because the human being in a new technological world , such as Internet , media , and mobile phone , we are exposed in the explosion of information surroundings .
Every person , if he or she wants , can try to gain information , like math or chemic , from everywhere ; moreover , everyone could be not completely far from every new information .
Beside , almost the mordorn workers or schoolars must know many aspects of knowledge to use them better in one way , because many companies and reaserch organizations need this kind of people .

Second , for sake of survive in the morden world , people at least have to know new information for living .
People could not live too comfortable if they do not know how to use computer .
For exemple , students have to log in the web of the school to know what programs it has and might register the final exam by personal .
If some student is unable to use Internet , he or she must go to office of school or ask the proffesor about this problem .

In the nutshell , although we still need some specific schoolar to reaserch much detail in one subject , most of people can not be just limited by this statement because not everyone could be the great scientist or artist .
Consequantly , I mainly agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
