I do not agree the statement .
Travelling in a group led by a guide may seem to make your trip more comfortable , as the whole intinery has been planned for you .
You only need to follow the lead and ` woo and wow ' over the spectacular sights .
But this may lose the whole point of travelling to a foreign country in the first place : You want to enjoy yourself in a place that you have never been before , therefore you travel .

The first thing that you will miss out when travelling in a group tour is the planning of your own trip .
You may be forced to go to places that you are not interested in , or even threatened to shop in a particular place .
As happened recently in Hong Kong , a Mainland China tour group was abandoned by their tour guide because they were not willing to buy anything from a designated shop .
This may only be an extreme case , but you cannot deny that you will only be able to see the famous tourist sights and nothing more if you go on a tour .
Yet , if you go on your own , you can go to all sorts of bizarre places that you may want to go , and not have to crowd with all the other tourists in the so-called ' tourist spots ' , which may not be appealing to you at all .

Some people may be afraid to get lost if they go to a totally strange place on their own .
But I say that is part of the thrill and fun of travelling to a foreign place .
You could find your own way out , and maybe find an exciting place that you did n't even know about before .
Or you could always ask the locals for directions , possibly developing a friendship with them .
Travelling on your own allows you to have more interaction with the place and the people .
When I travelled to Thailand on my own , while tourists were eating bland food in a ` high-end restaurant ' , I was eating delicious local food andchatting away happily with the locals at one of the market stalls .
Language is not a problem ; you will learn how to communicate fluently in a mix of oral and body languages in no time .
See ?
Another benefit of travelling on your own .

On the whole , the main point of travelling is to seek pleasure in a place beyond your own home .
If you cannot fully experience the place , then why waste money and time to go on a trip ?
