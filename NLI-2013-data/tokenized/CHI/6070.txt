It 's 21th centry now , and if you visit to a developed country , you can see cars everywhere .
Cars have become an important part of our daily life , on weekdays we drive to work , at weekends we drive to tour .
For myself , I do n't believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
First of all , cars are too convenient .
Everyone wants to have a car if they could .
And , as the technology improving , to producing a car become much more easier than before .
What 's more , they are even cheaper !
In the past , you may found someone complaining about cars are too expensive .
Nowaday , you 'll only hear that people could n't decide which one to buy !
Some families even have two or more cars , for each family members they have their own car .
That 's something you ca n't ever imagine before .

The second reason i would like to talk about , is the developing country .
Take China for example , think about how many people are there in China .
What will happen if everyone in China bought a car ?
Maybe it will be a super traffic jam , but it 's something that could really happen .
In the recent years , the developing country , such as China , India , and Tailand , had grow repidly on their economy .
What make it worse is that they are also the regions that have the most population around the world .
Combine the two factors , people and money , it will be a huge market for everything , and cars , of course .
Or maybe you could tell the 600 million people to take the bus ?
Well , that still need a lot of buses , and still increases the number of cars .

I do know that cars have lots of bad affects on our environment , and i hope that the number of cars could decreases through the time .
But , will that be happen ?
I do n't think so .
Maybe we need more education on people about how the cars hurt the environment , so that the number of cars wo n't increase so fast .
But to decrease ?
I do n't think so .
