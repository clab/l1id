Some people hold that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
As far as I am concerned , I 'd like to take a neutral stand on this issue .
My opinions go as follows .

In the first place , with no doubts , the society aspires talents who have comprehensive knowledge of many academic subjects .
For instance , in some companies , a secretary is expected to perform not only in administration , but also in related areas such as banking , accounting , marketing and HR .
Nowadays it 's not uncommon that more and more companies , in order to acquire more profits , often cut back costs on the number of staff .
Making one staff do the work of two or even three is not unusual .
Employees at work are expected to be equipped with broad knowledge , so that they can perform in all areas .
As we all know that to do well at work , you have to be an all-rounder .
Many people have been aware that language command and computer skills all have become common tools , all modern people need to know how to use a computer .
We have to admit that a lawyer who could speak English and has good computer knowledge can do better than his or her counterpart who does not speak a foreign language .

However , in certain fields , people need to be specialized in one specific subject .
This is especially true in science and technology field .
To do well in a certain field , people have to be specialized in it .
especially those students who take doctorate degrees , some are specifically in Glass , some in Optic Fibre .
In my opinion , even an accountant can do very well if he or she gets only specialized in accounting .

We need to be objective in this issue .
Depends on what field you are in and what job you are taking , either has no harm .
