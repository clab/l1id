Understanding the ideas and concepts than just learning the facts are more essential for students due the different interestes , understanding and efficiency .
People have different interestes in different areas .
Therefore , they focus on different areas .
Sometime , people care more bout the reasons than the facts .
For example , they learn about the cause and effect of an event rather than jumping right to the conclusion and just learn the facts .
By doing this , they get more familiar with the topic .

Besides different interestes , understanding towards the topic is equally important because once people understand what the topic is mainly about , they focus more on the additional information about the topic .
Also , when people understand the ideas , it is easier to learn and memorize them .
Therefore , understanding towrads the ideas are required because it makes people think more and learn more .

Time is another significance factor .
If people start on the unfamiliar topic right away without previewing or understanding the ideas , it takes much more time to acutually learn the facts form them .
For example , if people previews their lessons before class , they know what the teacher is going to talking about .
Therefore , they can understand the concepts in the class rihgt away without taking another reviewing time later .
Also , during the class time , they can ask questions and have good interaction with the teacher .

In conclusion , it is more important for students to actually understand the concepts than it is for them to learn facts beacause of different interestes , understanding and efficiency .
