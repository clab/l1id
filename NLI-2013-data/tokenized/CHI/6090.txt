This is a controvertial topic about whether the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
As far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars .
My reasons are listed as follows .

First , we should take a glance at the opposite opinions .
Some people will deem that with the rapid economic growth ( especially in China ) , people will continue to buy their own cars because it is a convenience to their lives , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowded bus , which is commonly seen in China .

However , these people seem to ignore several essential aspects that would lead to the reduce of the numbers of cars .
The important reason is that people 's awareness of protecting the environment is gradually increased .
We all recognize the fact thatour environment is facing serious problems caused by human pollution , like global warming and water pollution , air pollutions .
And the government as well as the increasing number of people are taking effort to protect the environment .
They can give up using of plastic bags , so they can also give up buying their own car .

The equally important reason is that the oil price skyrockted in the last year and the prices are going to increase in the future .
It is just too expensive to afford a car to the majority of people because they have to use a lot of money to support their family , to pay for the education fees of their children , and to pay for the medical services .
They will choose to use public transportations due to the higher and higher oil price .

Moreover , the government is taking great effort to build public transportations .
They use a large number of money on developing more rail road , more buses to every corner of the contry .
and also metros have been built to easing the heavy traffic in more and more big cities .

Taking into account of all the aspects mentioned above , I am firmly convinced with the opinion that the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
