Nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generations .
However , I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion , the young people , at least in Singapore where I am currently studying , do contribute to their communities with great passion and enthusiasm .

First of all , the youth 's passion to serve the communities can be evident in the large number of voluntary activities they are involved in .
Almost every secondary or high school student participates in community service on a regular basis .
They either go to the community library to do clean-ups and shelving , or they go to the `` Old Folks Home '' to interact with the old people there and ensure these people have fun and joy .
The musical groups in some schools may also organise concerts for the public , and donate the profit made to charity organisations .
The regular involvement of the youth in voluntary community service undoubtedly demonstates their enthusiasm and effort in helping their coummunity .

More importantly , the government also places a great emphasise in ensuring the young people to give sufficient time to helping their communities .
The Ministry of Education introduces the `` Community Involvement Programme '' ( short-termed CIP ) , where students must contribute to their communities in some form , and the time of their contribution is reported by the related organisations .
This time , known as `` CIP hours '' , is an important element in the assessment of a student .
If one does not fulfill the minimun requirement of CIP hours , he may not be admitted by a good high school or college .
This education policy ensures that the young people contribute enough time to helping their communities .

Furthermore , the effort of school and society is also crucial in making sure that the youth contribute enough to the communities .
In school , desirable social values such as care for those in needs are taught to students so that they can become better citizens .
Teacher encourage and guide students to carry out service learning projects , in which they either serve a particular group of people as mentioned earlier , or they can raise funds for charity organisations .
Some companies facilitate these service learning projects by providing initial fundings and organising competitions .
For instance , one company , `` IE Singapore '' , organises a competiton in which they provide 1000 dollars initial fund to each participating group .
These groups are supposed to use the fund and come out with a creative way to raise more money for charity organisations .
The group raising the greatest sum wins .
Personally I participated in this competition last year .
We used the funding to buy raw materials and made them into different shapes of balloons .
It selt well and after 4 months of hard work , we were able to raise over 90000 dollars fund .
We donated the money to Children 's Cancer Foundation .

In conclusion , nowadays young people are having great academic burdens and more demanding requirements , but their effort to helping the communities is not sacrificed .
They devote enough time in coummunity service in voluntary activities , under the education policy of the government , and as inspired by school and society .
