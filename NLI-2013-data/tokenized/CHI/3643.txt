I personally agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .
It 's quite usual to see that several young people hanging out in a pub or a football field , but it 's unusually to see they are appearing at community centres or a aged person 's back yard to help him/her to clean .

The world is becoming more attractive to young people than ever before .
The internet , various computer games , gaming consoles , fancy toys and etc. have been taking a lot of time from the young generation .
Compared to the past , young people used to spend more time on studying , and also more time on participating community activities , and helping and learning from each other .

The relationship between people , especially in urban areas , are getting far more looser than before , which partially causes young generation are more relying on themselves than on the neighbourhood .
Everyone is busying on their own stuff and trying to make more money to get so called better life while ignoring the importance of the communities that they belong to .

Family teaching may be another reason why young people prefer staying away from others .
Lots of facts showed that our society are not becoming safer .
Instead , we are seeing moer and more criminals reported everyday , our neighbourhood are no long a safe place to be .
Lots of parents are more likely to leave their children at home while they are busying on their own business .
From very young , children learnt to play with themselves at home , and to spent their time at home .

To conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activities which will help them to understand an important part of lives , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .
