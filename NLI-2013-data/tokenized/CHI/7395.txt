Every once in a while , we take a vacation and go travelling to different countries .
We want to see and experience other cultures other than our own during these travels .
There are two different ways to do this , either through the leadership of a tour guide or to explore by yourself .

I believe that traveling by yourself without a tour guide is the best way to travel .
First of all , the beauty of exploring is the fact that you do not know what you will find .
If you have a tour guide to tell you all the fun secrets and places , then where is all the fun in that ?
And often , the tour guide and the group will express their own opinions upon the places and objects that you come across .
Which isnt all that good because it limits our insight on the culture we choose to explore .

Secondly , the best way the fully experience a culture , is to roam the streets yourself and find out what interesting objects you see or what happens on the streets .
If you let yourself roam the streets and become part of the society , you will be able to discover and learn many things that you will not be able to learn if you are walking with a tour guide .
In addition to that , learning through experience is a lot better and more satisfying than someone telling you about it .

When you get a vacation to travel , you want to get away from all the stress and authority at work .
If you do not travel with a tour guide , you will be able to acheive that goal more effectively , because if you travel with a tour guide , you will still feel that someone is in charge of your life .

The next time you travel , i highly suggest that you do not hire a tour guide .
A tour guide really limits your travel experiences to mere sightseeing .
Traveling alone and experienceing the culture while becoming one with it is in my opinion , the best way to travel .
