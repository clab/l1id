Yes , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
The nature of advertisements is to sell , be it a consumer product or a political message .
In order to sell , advertisements often exhibits the following features :

First of all , advertisements often create an attractive image associated with the product to their consumers or their audience .
Advertisements , especially those TV ads with sound and picture , often present the products to consumers in a more appealing way .
For example , an advertisement for Nextle Coffee in China .
The TV ad has several handsome young men and elegant young women sipping coffee with a background soundover `` great flavor , great taste ! ''
.
People in China watched this ad unconsciously have the impression that cool , trendy , handsome people drink coffee .
The sales of Nextle coffee shot up after the ad .
Though tea is more popular in China , yet the attractive image presented in the ad lured many tea drinkers to buy Nextle coffee .
They want to be associated with the trend .
In this case , advertisements here add halo effect to the products .

Secondly , advertisements often use image leader to convey appealing message to their audience .
For example , Nike 's TV ad with Michael Jordon playing a basket ball accompanying the Nike logo and `` just do it '' message is very tempting .
People feel that wearing Nike shoes , they can be more successful .
It creats an illusion .
Because people admire Jordon and they want to buy the shoe brand he is wearing .
Here , Jordon is the image leader .
People follow suit .
People want to identify themselves with famous people .

Finally , advertisements often only mention the positive things about the products and ignore or downplay the side effects or negative aspects of the produccts .
For example , ads for drugs .
`` Ask your doctor if this medicine is for you '' instead of mentioning the side effects .

In sum , advertisements are marketing tools .
They cannot truly reflect what products they are .
They often elevate the products .
