Being old does n't mean anything , many people are old and still have fun .
I really do n't agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
Being young you might have more energy than a old person does .
We all know that being young is a very good , we can go out and play football or basketball without worrying about breaking a bone .
Old people can also do that , but they just have to be more careful than the young ones .
There are many old sports player out there still left in the world .
For example there is Brett Favre who is hitting 40 pretty soon .
I know that is n't really old , but in football that is a pretty old age .

Many old people can be very active in other business espically the arts .
We all see many fashion designers , actors , and novelist who are all pretty old and still making good movies and writing good books and making beautiful clothes .
Helen Mirren is a good example of an old actress who knows how to have fun .
Her performance in this years `` The Queen '' has her for a frontrunner to take home the Academy Award .
Many times its usually the young ones who get crtical acclaim for their performaces .
You also see many old actor hitting the clubs like Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears without their underwear on .
You see Bruce Willis and George Clooney who still hit the clubs .
You also see many old fashion designers , who still make the best gowns for people to wear .
Many people might like Zac Posen or Proenza Schouler or the newest fashion designer that just graduated from Parsons , but in the end people still like the old fashion designer such as Oscar de le Renta .

In the end , I do n't agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
