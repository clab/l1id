I totally agree with the sentence .
If you do not try new things , you gain nothing even you suceed in getting what you want , as you have not gain any expirence in the process .

Columbia will not find America if he does not dare to sail out to the strange seas neither will we know who he is now .
We can only get real success if we do the things in our own way not to follow others .

This quality should be in everyone 's mind especially those doing business , if you do not dare to invest where can you get your gain ?
It goes the same in every thing , life is doing business , we should dare to invest smartly and only by doing so we can gets the gain , the experience .
This prove the saying no pain , no gain .

People always like to follow the steps of other people , without thinking if you are really suitable for it .
A specific example the choosing the courses in the university , you can do a survey and check to see that how my percent students choose their future according to their own likings , I think about only 10 % .
Most of the students follow the instructions given to them by their parents , they do not dare to disobey them even though the course they choose is not to their likings

Some might say that the adults or the people done before knows what is right or wrong , the are experienced and knows what is the best , it is true that they have the experience , however it is the experience of their not our own ones , inorder to really learn things we need to learn them the hard way , go facing the problems on our own , do not be a coward .

Another example of a successful person who suceed in what he is doing by trying is Bill Gates the world richest man .
Will he be rich if he does not dare to introduce Windows to the world ?
I doubt so .
If you wants to be as successful as Bill Gates , dare to try .
