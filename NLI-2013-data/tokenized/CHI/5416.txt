When it comes to advertisements , quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement .
Among countless factors which influence my point .
There are three conspicuous aspects as follows : Firstly , according to a survey , the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisement because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements .
These cheats take place everywhere and everytime , on TV , on radio , in supermarket , in cyberspace .
Thousands of people are suffering these kinds of advertisements .

Another reason can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertisement is to appeal buyers .
With the development of high-tech , products are eaeily produced and designed .
they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function .
How a factory or a supermarket can win in such keen competing Advertisement is the key .
Although honesty is a very imporatnt in morden society , not all advertisements can be honest .
Nobody wants to spend money on useless produces .
So those products should be seemed much more better , beautiful , functional than they really are .

Thirdly , for many factories and supermarkets or sales , maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements .
Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheatig Advertsements can perfect products .
There are not products but music , beautiful scenery in them , Of course , not alll advertisements are cheating .
many advertiments are good as well as their products .
However , just few of them .
To sum up , I reallly agree with the notion that most advertsements make products seem much better than they really are .
