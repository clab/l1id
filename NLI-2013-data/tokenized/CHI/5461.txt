I am agree the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The people always make the products seem much better then they really are .
First , they always use the entertainment to show to the constumas .
They will use a lot of ways to show to the people how good they are , and how usefull they are .
Secondly , when the people have make the products are not use the origanal of the item 's use way to do , they have think a lot of the now function to make the people have to buy that .
For example for the eye content .
The eye content maker are not make the eye content for the people what they really need the eye content .
Althought , they make the eye content have a lot of the colors , and then given to the people want their eye change color and more petty .

In my remenber , one day i had to go to buy the eye content .
And then the saler had to ask me , `` Are you looking for the eye content , we have some new arrivde .
They have new function , they can make your eyes change the color . ''
And she had say a lot of that product how good they are .
The saler as like the eye content was she made .
And i answer to her , `` Oh really , i want to try that . ''
So , i had to bougth that color eye content .
And then , i had try that color eye content about two weeks .
i feel my eyes really pain , and my friends always my eyes are vary red .
So , i have went to check my eyes .
And the doctor say , '' You have abslutely stop to use the color eye content , if you continus to use that , it will make your eyes bliend .
That color eye content are not vary good for your eyes . ''
So , i have stop to use that eye content .

In my expericent and opinin , i have really agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The saler has say how good is the eye content , but te eye content are not really good as what was the saler say .
And the eye content are not really can change your eye color .
