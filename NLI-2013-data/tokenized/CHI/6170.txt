Fifty years have witnessed the rapid development of the car industry .
Nowadays , the topic wether there will be fewer or more cars in use in twenty years than that of today has been hotly debated .
Although some people hold the opinion that there will be more cars in twenty years because of the develop of the ecnomy , some people believe that the car numbers will become fewer .
Personally , I am one of those believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
My view will be greatly sustantiated by the following discussions .

The most persuasive point is that the science tecnologies are rapidly developping now .
That means there will be some other veicles subsititue cars .
According to some available surveys , it is said that over 60 percentages companies which are faminiar for their car producing are engaging in inventing new veicles .
For example , the Toyota company in Japan has invest over 7 billions to invent new veecles , and some new productions were showed in the presentations during the past few years .

Furthermore , the resouces in our planet are not allow too much cars which comsume a great mount of energy to run in our society .
accompaning with the development of the groble ecnomic , more and more countries especially China consum a lot fuels .
Not only do the gas has been greatly reduced but also other resurces .
It is commonly believed that cars pay an important role in the reductions .
If the number of cars are more that that of today , what other resouces will be provided to cars .

In addition , the environments in the world areworsen now .
There is a strong lik between an increasing the car numbers and the worsen pollution in our world .
You imagine what it will be when almost every people drive themselves to work .
Recently , the stradegy of sustainable development has been widely spreaded , Many measures relate to the policy will help the world to get fewer cars .

Taking into account all these factors which sometimes correatle together to generate an integrate whole and thus become more coving than any single one of them , we may safely draw the conclusion that the car numbers will be reduced in twenty years , that means there will be fewer cars than that of today .
