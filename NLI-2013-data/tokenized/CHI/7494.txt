First of all , i disagree with the statment .
I prefer to have a travel in group all my by ourselves .

The reason that i disagree with the statment are , first , i will have less freedom on my trip .
Basically , going for a trip is a way to relax and have more private rooms for ourselves .
So a led who usually is usually a stranger could interrupt our privacy .

Second , the tour guides may usually misleading us to some places where we are not willing to go .
For example , if we are hoping for somewhere for excitments .
By mostly , the tour guides may usually get us to some places purpose for shopping or those typical places for sightseeing which may probably cant fulful our wishes .

Maybe you may doubt that what if we are not able to led our way when going to somewhere that we never been to ?
Of course , this will be hard to go .
At this point , i will first suggest u to join with the tour guides for your first trip .
Because during the trip , you will get some of their advices and knowledge to help you go by yourselves in the future .
When after that trip , you will be able to go for a trip all by yourselves .
And , you will have chances to discover more excitments without the tour guides .

Going travel without any tour guide could be fun .
There must be more unkowns and unpreditable results finally .
During the travel , all disicions all make by ourselves and the time controlling has no limit .
We are able to stay or leave whenever we want .
Every moment we are having is great and exciting , becaus .
And this is the main purpose to go travel .
To explore , to experience , to taste the life .
