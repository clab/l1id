Yes , I agree .
But I do n't know what will happen in twenty years ..
Now we have been live in a modern world , its exciting .
sure , it is changing our life .
for example , twenty years ago , It is impossible to know what is PS2 and xBox for us .
so `` in twenty there will be fewer cars in use than ther are today '' the question we do n't know .
its fantasy ..
we can
