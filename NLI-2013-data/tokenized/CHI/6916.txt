As a mater of fact , the issue of whether there will be fewer cars than there are today is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment .
Different people hold different views due to their distinct background .
Therefore , there are no easy or certain answers to the question and final answers would rely on my own experiencr and personality .

I do agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In the following discussion , I would develop my poins of views and constitute aspects of details as sufficient as possible .

In the first place , the most important reason that I cannot ignore is that nowaday , people have realize that the cars will produce seriously air pollution and this situation has became a big issue around the world .
To illustrate , it is apparent that air pollution has rais the attention of the global citizens and the most effective way to solute this problem is to decrease cars in use .

In the second place , another reason for my statement is that the oil price would be more expensive twenty years than today .
The amount of the oil will decrease but the demand of the oil will remain the same even increase .
Therefore , there will be ferwer cars in use because only a very small portion of people who might be very rich can afford the price .

Last but not least , I believe that people will use MRT as their transportation in the future because MRT is not only convenient but also in a reasonable price that everyone can afford it .
Therefore , there will be no need to buy a car as transportation .

To sum up , the air pollution cause by cars and high price of oil made me agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
