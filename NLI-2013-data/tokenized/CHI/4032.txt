`` Young peple nowafays do not give enough time to helping their communitites '' I believe this is untrue .
But I also believe that the ratio of people who do not help their communities of young people and adult are the same .
And these are as many adults who do not help to as many young people who do n't .

Many adults say that young people these days do n't help their communities enough .
To certain extent believe this is true and there are may young people who do not do these things , but i also believe that adults do not give enough time to helping their community too .
I do not think this is true everywhere , but I have seen a lot of adults in my area who do not participate at all to help their communities .
And I do not believe this is wrong because eveyone want their own spare time and do things that they like instead of sacrificing their time helping out the community .
So if adults do not want to sacrifice their time doing the work and do things they like , why should young people get some time to do things they like to do ?
So I really believe that adults and young people should not tell each other how they are not doing what they are suppose to do instead we should give eachother some space of our own .

Another reason that make this statement true is because adults are not showing us the right model .
As I mentioned , I have seen a lot of adults who do not participate at all in helping the communities , so the argument is if adults are not doing anything how can they order us to what they are not doing ?
Therefore I believe in order for young people to participate those activities , adults must first show the model to the young people , and eventually the young people will start to follow these adults as their models .

Overall I believe that helping out the communities and making them a better place is something good , and people do prefer these advantages , but what the adults should do first is not complaining about how young people are not doing what they are suppose to do but instead show the young people the right models so those young people will follow these modles togather making the communities nice places to live in .
