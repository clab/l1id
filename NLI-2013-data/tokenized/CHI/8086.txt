It is often difficlut for people to decide whether for students to understand the ideas and concepts or to learn facts to be important .
For us students , the importance of learning facts always outweigh this of understanding the ideas and concepts .
Tere are numerous facts why I agree with thi spoints , and I would in here like to explain a few of the most important oes .

First of all , learning facts can let the students master the events or knoweledge firmly .
Knowing the fact , students the meanig how the ideas or concepts are created .
For example , the concept of nutrients , what of the food is of nutrutional , when students know the milk can provide protein for people health , then they know `` protein '' is the nutrutional element .
That would be better to illustrate the facts than to tell the concepts in this case .

Secondly , understanding facts is helpful for students to make difference between different ideas and concepts .
Since diferent ideas and concepts are originated different facts and the facts are always easily distinguished .
For a instance , the `` frezen point '' and `` the dew point '' , these describe different

In conclusion , but if all factors are contemplanted , it is no difficlut to inconclude that learning facts carries out more weight than those of knowing ideas or concepts .
So , in conclusion , I Think that learning facts is superior to inderestanding ideas and concepts .
