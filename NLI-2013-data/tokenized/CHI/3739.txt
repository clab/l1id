I agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to helping their comminities .
This can be attributed to some of the social as well as educational problems that we are having today .

Firstly , the accumulation of wealth in our society has made the life of the young today much easier than their father generations .
The young usually lead comfortable life that they do not have to worry about anything .
This type of life has caused them to have a lack of experience of problems that people can meet in life and have little understanding of other people 's needs .
As a result , they may not have the initiative to take part in any community works .
For example , a typical family in Singapore enjoys the living standard of a developed country and the young people in the country mostly cares about the popular stars in the media or in the sports only .
They lack the caring attitudes for other people and they do not care about the community works either .

Secondly , the education that young people received today mainly focuses on academics and extra curriculum acitivities , which usually have high criteria for them to achieve .
As a result the young will be likely to concentrate themselves on their respective school works only that they do not spare their time for community works .
In the case of Singapore , the students receive very high expectations from both their teachers and parents .
Many of them have to strive hard to achieve certain goals .
In addition to that , the extra curriculum activities may occupy majority of their spare time including the time after school and the weekends so much that they may only be able to leave school after nine o'clock in the night each day .
In circumstances like above , the students will not have the time to go for community works even if they wish to .

The Third reason to the little participation of young today in community work today may be attributed to the kind of education that they receive at home .
In the case of Singapore , the parents do not encourage the children to go out and get involved in community works because these are regarded as `` Adults ' work '' .
The young grown up in this kind of family background will have a natural notion to stay away from the community works .
This may only apply to the case of Singaproe , but for the cases of many other countries , some parents may try to influence the children not to getting involved in teh community works because these works do not bring them benefits !
The family education of this type may install a sense of selfishness in the young and restrain them from community work .

In conclusion , the young people are not giving enough time to help their communities , but it is not a problems that oriented from the young alone .
