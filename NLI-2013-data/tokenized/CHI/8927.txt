Some people like hold the opion that learn ideas and concepts is much important than learn facts , even though teachers and parents .
But in my opion , I would prefer that learn facts is more important than just learn ideas and concepts .
Beacuse the facts can be clearly and deeply unserstand that what is the real thing .

Firstly , facts are more clearly unserstand when you learn something .
If you learn facts that makes you really clearly about the article , you can know about the heart of the article .
Ideas and concepts just points in the articl or news when you learn in the classroom .
For example , when you first see the articl or news which you will find main ideas and expalin points .
You just learn about the face .
You just learn how to write a normal writing .
Also like the words and some beautiful sentences .
In the classroom , some theachers just teach about consistant .
What is article , how to write article , remember the beautifu words and sentences .

Sencondly , did you know what is author what to say ?
It 's not ideas , concepts and beautiful words .
The articls just want people understands that what they want say , which is the most important problems in the world .
Some articl is writing about that they want people pay attention the problem .
But they did n't pay attention about the article 's sprit .
And if you understand facts which you will learn more abou the article , it 's make depply for you understand the article .

In sum of , you must cleal \ rly and depply
