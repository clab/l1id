There are many ways we can choose in our trip .
There are two major and popular ways for trip .
One is travel in a group led by a tour guide , the other is travel by oneself .
In my opoinion , I do n't agree with the following statement about `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''

I have travelled in a different places since I was a child .
I travelled both in a group led by a tour guide and by myself .
During these experience , I disagree with the following statement about `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
There are some reasons and examples to support my answer as follows .

In my opinion , first , it 's waste time to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Many people will choose to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , becasuse they think it 's safe , especially they are in a foreign countries .
But , I think too many people will waste many time .
Because different people have different interests , travelling is in a group led by a tour guide , they ca n't make all of you feel the trip is just for you .
Sometimes travelling is in a group led by a tour guide will guide you to visit some places which are unnecessary or you do n't like .
Because travel agency ca n't satifify all of you .

The second reason to support my answer is it 's waste money .
When you join in a group led by a tour guide .
It is certain they can arrange all your plan in a trip totally and you do n't have to worry many things .
But they will ask you to give them extra fee and tips in many ways .

Third and last reason is you do n't have free and flexible time .
As for me , I went to foreign country for studying for one month by meself .
Although I 'm not good at the language , comparing with other people I had much more free time and learned many things in travel by myself .

I have many different experiences in traveling .
This is way I disagree `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
