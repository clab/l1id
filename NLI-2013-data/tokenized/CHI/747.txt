Recently , a hot issue about whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is wildly discussed among the students and professor .
Somepeople hold that one can learn more about the world by having broad knowledge .
And other 's agrue that having a expertise in a specific subject can led a bright way for people in their career life .
As to me , I prefer to the former one that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Since we live in a complex and extensive world , having broad knowledge contributes to helping us to know more about the world we live in .
With the knowledge of many academic subjecs , one can easily explain some case that happens everyday around us .
For example , one of my friends always leads the origniation by observing the poision of stars when we hike outside .

Besides , have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can also help us to better understand the knowledge in a single subject .
Becaues the knowledge is interweaved to some extent , the knowledge gained in one lessen can be applied to solve a difficult problems in an other fields .
For instance , I offen find that princples teached in management class can be a good guide when I plan to set a project that required by marketing lesson .

At last , i think the student should not only to have broad knowledge but also to specialize in one specific subject as well in order to meet the demand of society /
