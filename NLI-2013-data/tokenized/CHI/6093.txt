There is a public controversy nowadays that whether we should decrease our car-use in the following twenty years .
Differnt people have different views due to their individual angles .
The people who prefer to drive the car holds the opinion that the industrial development needs transportation by using cars .
But some person think these vehicle will pollute our environment , so the country should limit to use cars as traffic tools .
As far as i am concerned , I would absolutely choose the latter opinion .
I would reason and provide convincing examples to support my viewpoint as follows .

The foremost reason we cannot deny is that the whole world 's evironment become worse gradually .
The industrial development without careful consideration caused problems even worse than we can imagine .
The whole country overflowed by pollutions like the white pollution , nosie pollution , the air pollution and light pollution .
And many amout of them are caused by using cars .
And those pollutions will threat our health .
Also the increasing cars burn fuels larger than ever before , the energy in the whole world is decrease fastly .
Maybe in few years , we could not use fuel to move our cars .

The reason why I casts my preference for cars decreasing is that a lot of specises have already extincted .
Because they can not accommodate themseleves to the changing living conditions .
As a undergraduate students majored in life science , I will do something for those living creatures .
So I hope we can find some other vehicles to take but not cars which will produce toxic output .
Therefore I always take my short trip by cycling instead of traveling by cars .

Of couses , there are some merits by using cars .
But the advantages and the disadvantages of using cars are carefully compared .
We can see clearly that protecting our enviornment outweigh the advantages of using cars .

All in all , consider all supports pointed above , we can ratinoally see that deceasing the car use is very important of our dailylife .
