I have travelled abroad for more than five times .
Half of the travels I made was with a tour guide , while the other half did n't .
I have to admit that traveling with a tour guide in a group is really a easier way to travel .
Everything is planned by the tour guide .
You do n't need to worry about where to stay in the next stop , how to get the next destination .
However , if I have time to make travel plans in advance , I prefer travel on my own .

I can take my time to enjoy the journey more when traveling alone than with a tour group .
I like going to museums , seeing art displays and savoring the exotic cuisines .
I can keep my own pace in the journey and really have a good look at the cities .
The travel plans made by the travel agencies are often too packed for me .
I do n't like to be in a hurry .

The other thing that I like to travel alone is that I do n't need to put up with other people in a tour group .
Sometimes I mett members in the tour group that really have bad habits .
For example , I 've been in a tour group , and one of the members in the group was often late for the scheduled time .
As a result , the whole group had to postpone our next schedule just because of his lateness .

Compared with traveIing in a group with a tour guide , I enjoy traveling by myself more .
In this way , I can really see what I want to see and I do n't have to face the inconveniences caused by some members in the tour group .
