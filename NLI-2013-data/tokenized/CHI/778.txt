There are many ways that the topic of the better way to gain knowledge can be approached .
Some people think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better , while others do not .
I have my point of view as well .
There are two reasons why I am in favor of having broad knowledge .

A key reason underlying my choice is that if we study broadly , we can be more competitive in the future .
Take my brother , for example .
While he was studying during university , he decided to have English teaching for his minor .
Although he lost a lot of time hanging out with friends , he got more choices when he graduated from the university .
Moreover , because of his ability of English speaking and his major , marketing , he got promoted quickly .
Such an example shows that studying broadly can help us become more competitive .

Another important reason why I choose studying broadly is that sometimes , we wo n't be so sure about what we are going to do in the future .
If we studying broadly , we can find out our real interests from all these subjects and choose the one we want .
Take my father , for example .
When he was in college , he majored in History .
As a matter of fact , It would be hard to find a job except being a teacher .
Unfortunately , my father does n't like to teach at all .
However , he took more classes in other departments , and try to choose one subject that he really likes .
Finally , he choosed Chinese and he became an editor in a big newspaper company in my country .
Without broad knowledge , my father may not be such successful today .

Of course , there is an argument to be made for other posotions .
Nevertheless , I think the reasons that I have presented are stronger .
