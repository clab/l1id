Some people like to hold the opinion that a person is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is superior to a person have specialize subject in one specific subject , but others contradict it .
personaly , i wonder prefer a person have broad knowledge in many academic subjects because i think it has some of advantages .

there are numerous reasones why i support a person have broad knowledge , and i would like in here explainning a few of the most important ones .
First , and foremost , the main reason is that it can beneficial for a person to hunt for their jobs .
if one person have a broad knoeledge , it means that one has variety information and skills form their academic subjects .
what he own these information can make him improve his sight .
this sight also really is requirement for the company .
it is can be given the concrete example , one of my classmate , he has study many academic subjects in university , such as mathmatics , chemistry , literature , and even music .
after he graduated from university , he easily to land a job .
this due to the employer belive what the broad knowledge of his will make work successful .

another reason why i advocated the attitude of the person have broad knowledge necessary is that it make one person think deeply and become creativity .
if one person limited one specific subject , he should be have limited knowledge that obstucle his mind .

But in all factors are contemplated , it is not difficult to conclude that the advantage of one person have broad knowledge carrys more weight than those of one person concentrat in one specific subject , from what we discussed we may draw a conclusion that one person own broad knowledge has more advantege .
