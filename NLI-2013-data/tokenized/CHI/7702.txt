Some people think say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide with a strick schedule .
While this might be true in some circumstances , it is better to travel with a few close friends without a strict schedule .
Traveling with a few close friends without a specific schedule or route allows people to truely experince a place with a constant sense of excitement and exploration .

When traveling with a large group with a tour guide .
The tour guide usually lay out a planned route and informs poeple where the next stop is .
This takes the fun of exploration out of traveling .
Traveling is about seeing new things and explore a place without a person spoon-feeding you of the information about the place .
Different people want to visit different places , because of repective tastes .
Artists might typically visit a museum of natural science , while an archeologist might not be interested in visiting a modern art exhibition .
However , in a large group with a tour guide , there is no freedom to explore a place and skip tourist sites by one 's own will .
Everyone WILL see what everyone else sees .
There is no skipping or revisiting of any particular sites .
Such trips will rarely satisfy any members of the traveling group completely .

However , traveling with a tour guide might prove to be convenient sometimes .
In a foreign country , where the people speak a different language from yours , having a tour guide can save you valuable time and energy asking for directions or prices of items .
The tour guide will help you bypass the frustration of language barrier , since he/she knows the language .
Conversely , hiring a tour guide cost much money .
Without a tour guide , you can travel with more money to spend on hotel and food during the trip .

Traveling in a large group and tour guide can help you safe time and much frustration in a foreign country , which does not use your native language .
However , having a tour guide is expensive , and traveling in a large group ruins the fun of exploring a new place with complete freedom .
If the travelers in a trip are rushed like cattles , grazing past many sites superficially without satisfying anyone 's need in the group , then the trip is not a fulfilling one .
Therefore , such trips should be avoided ( or experienced by just reading internet articles ) .
