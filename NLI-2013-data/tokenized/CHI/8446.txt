I think it is more important for us student to learn facts than to understand the idea .
For my personal experience , I learned more when I learned the facts first .

I had been raised in Taiwan .
When I was a student in elementary school , middle school , and high school in my country , teachers taught us or asked us to memorize two times one equals two , two times two equals four , two times three equals six , and so on .
At that time , no one told me why , I had been wondered why two times one equals two , but I had no choice and be forced to memorize them .

As time went by , I have been taken many math classes , such as algerbla 1 , algerbla 2 , calculous , so and so .
I realized why two times one equals two which bothered me when I was a 8 years old kid .
I first memorize the `` facts '' , and understand the `` idea '' itself .

Although now you may think there 's a time consume , and start wondering how long does it take me to realize the reason why two times one equals two .
Honestly , it did n't take me too much time to understand the concept , and the most important thing is I got the idea by myself which is more valuable .
I feel more confident and start been an indepent thinker .
Moreover , I wo n't forget about it because people always learn by the experience .
