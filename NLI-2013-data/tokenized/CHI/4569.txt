What is the purpose of advertisements ?
Most companys now spent much of their money in making advertisements because they want to sell more of thier products .
The propose of the advertisements is to attract more buyers .
Therefore , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

A consulting firm 's advertisement i saw last month is an excellent example .
In the advertisement , the company used a picture of a successful business man as the background .
In the bottom of the advertisement , the company listed some comments made by famous people .
Both the picture and the comments reflected that the company is very useful and reliable .
However , those informations are misleading .
Last week , a article by a major newspaper reported a big scandal about the reknown consulting firm .
It is said in the article that the company is not real .
After collecting money from many people who trusted the advertisement , the company vanished .
Neither its workers nor the police know where the ower of the business went with the money .

Test prep training center is another example of abusing advertisement .
In China , one have to go through tons of advertisement as he or she is reading a newspaper .
On a student prefered newspaper , most of the advertisements are about schools that can help one increase his or her score on a standardized test .
One advertisement in particular said that `` We gurentee an increase of at least 200 points on GaoKao ( a national standardized test fo . ''
Although the information the school gived is unrealistic , many believed that goint to that school in their only way to improve their score .
Many started to sign up and paied the expensive tuition .
After one year of training , those students took the test .
To their surprise , their score only improved a little .
Now they are suing the company for a return of their money .

From those two examples , we can see how many advertisements can make products that seemed better than they r
