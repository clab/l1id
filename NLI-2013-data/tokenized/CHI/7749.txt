From Columbia roaming around the world in his ship in search for undiscovered exoctic lands , to a family paying a weekend trip to a nearby state , we could see that people have long been enjoying the pleasure of travelling and being a tourist in foreign land .
When you start planning for a trip in the summer vacation , for instance , what is the first thing that you would do ?
Go to the book store and pick a travel book so you can plan your own ideal trip ?
Or go to a travel agency with your family and book an attractive travelling package ?
For me , I would go for the latter .

Booking a trip at an agency means that you are travelling in a group provided with a tour guide all along the way .
When traveling in a foreign place , a tour guide is unquestionably more experienced that you about every aspect of the place - its history , culture , tourist attractions , and anything other thing that a tourist would like to explore .
Imagine that you are going to France all by yourself , without a tour guide , what would you do if you would like to find a place to dine ?
You would surely ask a passer-by for directions .
But the problem is , you do not speak any French !
Even if you are lucky enough to bump into a resturant , you do not understand a word in the menu .
These problems would be all gone if you have a tour guide along with you .
A tour guide therefore , also helps us to break the language barrier by being the ` tranlsator ' because he is very often a local people from the country .

The second thing why travelling in a group led a tour guide is the possibility of cultural exchanges between the members the group .
You may discuss about things you find interesting along your way or even questions as simple as ` where to go shopping tonight ' .
This way of travel also offers a saver environment because a group is less prone to local crimes such as stealth .
Even if you unfortunately fell ill during the trip , there are people around who will be able to take care of you .

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is no doubt the best way to travel .
You are lead by someone familiar to the place who will explain everything which comes up to your mind , you are with your friends or family which help you out when you need .
In this way , you are comfortable and fully relaxed , and can enjoy the real pleasure of travelling .
