I agrre about the following statement .
I t is imortant that facts is one of communications to learn students .
There are three reasons why .
First of all , it has interest things .
Second of all , it has a lot of imformation .
Third of all , it has good education .
And then I think that it conects several idea for them .

The first reason is that it is difficult to interest the education for students .
For instance , some students are ignore about lessons or are a lot of lazy studets .
If teacher use the facts , it could be interest the lessons .

The second reason is that latest information is useful .
For example , if they teach the facts , students might be keep seaching th one things .
Therefore , it has possible that they pay attention about history .

The third reason is that if they improved their ability , they interested education to leran something to lessons .
In addition , if they teach facts , students try to discuss about one things .
This is both good for them .
At the moment , they try to learn something togethger .
They willbe freinedly also they understand each others .

In conclusion , I absolutely agree about that .
In the world , there have a lot of communication tool .
I think that one of communication is easy to underastand idea is facts .
First , students are really interested in facts .
Second , teacher can teach about latest information .
Third , good education is good for them .
Finally , Facts has several information because I definity agrre about the statement .
