I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Firstly , I think that to enjoy life has nothing to do with the age .
Older people can enjoy life as much as young people do .
Sometimes older people even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life more because they are older than the young people and realize what is more precious to the life .
For example , when my mother was young , she wanted to earn more money and brought up the child in a big house .
She worked hard .
She had little time to stay with the children .
When she was old , the children all left and went to university in another city or even in another country .
She realized that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stayed at home if she had been young again .
Obviously nothing is more delightful and memorable than to enjoy yourself with your dear childrens .
There are also many examples that the young people regret the days that they would enjoy the life better .

Secondly , we have many ways to enjoy the life .
The ways are not better or worse .
They are not less or more .
Young people may want to dance , to sing , to skate or to climb the mountain .
Older people prefer reading , watching television or just watching the sunset by the sea .
During the different period in our life , we have different ways to enjoy life .
Life can be as active as a tiger and life can also be quiet and calm as a small river .
We enjoy life in the different period .
When we are young , we want to challenge and to take risk .
When we are older , we can enjoy the peacefulness and normal happines in the life .

In a word , I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is not a question of age .
In fact , it is a question of attitude .
We can enjoy life in any stage of our life as long as we know how to appreciate the beauty of the life and to cherish what we have possessed .
