The education is more and more important to everyone in the world now , but different people have different pointviews on what is more important for the students .
Some people think that understand the ideas is more important , but there is also a group of people thinks that it shou n't be like that , learn facts is more important than understanding ideas .
I , however , believe that we should pay more attention on learn facts than understand ideas .
because the reasons below .

The first reason , the most important one , the ideas are coming from the facts and the facts is helping us to understand the idea better .
Here is an example , when we take the Physics classes , we always do a lot of labs , for what ?
To get the facts , then by these facts , we get the ideas by ourselves , then because we got the ideas by ourself , we understand these ideas much deeper than just learned from the teacher .
And also , the facts is helping us to understand the ideas much quicker .
As an example , if you want to learn swimming , do you think is it going to be learnning it quickier by just get the idea ?
Or you go inside the water , then you learned how to swim ?
Of course should be the second way .

Then the second reason , ideas sometimes get wrong , but how do you know ?
Without the facts , you never know .
Like in the past time , there is a idea about if two objects dropped from the same height , then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first .
but then a scientist do n't think so , so he did a lab , he went on a tower and dropped two object with different masses at same height , but these two objests hit the group at the same time , so that means the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong .
So we see , without the exam by the facts , you never know the idea is right or not .

Well , from the reasons above , we can say that , learning facts is important than understand ideas , no facts , no ideas , even we got the idea without the facts , you might get the wrong idea .
So I agree with the idea that pay more attention on learn facts .
