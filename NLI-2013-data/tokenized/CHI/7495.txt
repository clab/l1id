People may regrad traveling as a mean of relexing as other may think it is a chance to widen our point of view .
No metter , what the reason would be , there is only two ways to travel , that is with or without a guild .
Someone may think the best way to travel , which i totally argee with , is in a group led by a tour guide .

To begin with , travel with a guide in a group can ensure the safety of the tour .
Many rules of the locals that we may not know may occurs , and if we offended the locals the result would be destructive .
Like in China , Western may not know that Chinese is extremely susceptible to things that may bring bad luck .
For an example , walking under a ledder , breaking the mirror or even using the wrong foot to enter a building .
Moreover , the guide which knows the place well may tell you is that place safe or not .
For instant , he may advice you to keep an eyes on your wallet in some certain market due to the pickpocketer .

Secondly , every things included air ticket , hotal room and food may casue cheaper .
Some people may think that fee would be inflated dramically in the hand of a guide .
This is not totally true because although some extra fee may include , some certain expence may apportion among the group .

Finially , travelling in a group may have more fun .
While traveling in a group , we could surely make friend in the tour !
There will be more fine to have frineds to travel along .
If you were travelling alone , it would be obviously boring .
In short , regard to the aloneliness , i would say travelling alone would be rather pathic .
If we travel within a group , we could share our happiness with them instantly .

In short , undoubtablely the best way to travel is to be in a group .
Safety of the tour and oneself could be maintain becuase the guide could thell you what we should aware of .
Price of the ticket could be decrased .
Last , if provide a chance for you could meemore new friends !
