Nowadays young people are confronting to increasing pressure from working and studying , and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday .
Although it is true , I still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

It is a generally considered that almost all products of new technology are accepted , mastered and being used by young people first , so do the ones to provied convience and enjoy .
Young students , for example , have used to communicate with cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephone .
Although airplane has been common in China for tens of years , some older people still refuse to travel by airplane , for they think it is dangerous and a waster of money .
Old people refuse to or do n't know how to use many new products and can hardly receive benifits from modern society than young people .

Besides , it is obviously that young people are the natural leaders of the new fashion , and it is also a common sense that entainment , which is highly development in modern cities , are always first accepted by young people .
For instance , while I went to bars with my friends in my free time , my mother merely stayed in home with doing nearly nothing even she had enough free time .
Only when she was invited to a bar by her younger friends , she found it really a good place to get released .
Another fact is that a recent social study indicates that less than 70 percent of people who live in big cities of China receive benifits from new technology , and few of them are old people whose age is above 55 .

Moreover , enjoying life does not only shown on using the new products and enjoying entainments , but also the activities in society .
The social concept of older people are not OPEN enough even though the freedom and democrate of the society is progressing rapidly , especially in China .
Several researches have evdiently pointed out that the people who is older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of the society , and by this they can hardly enjoy the real freedom and democrate , which plays a important role in young people 's daily life .
From social activites I can release myself and win admire from others , which is essential to keep me feeling well .
Unfortunatly , my grand parents can not enjoy all of these .

Above , I think it is nature that young people enjoy life more than older people do , for their different in characties and the attitude to the new things .
While it is a fact that young people are facing to heavier pressure , I think it is worth to face , for we really enjoy a lot .
