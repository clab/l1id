I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
Advertisement itself is the way the company tell the people what they are making for them , the main propuse of making a advertisement is to convey people to buy their product .
It is the same as you are applying for college .
You do want the admission officer to see the advantages you have , and avoid the disadvantages as possible as you can .
By doing so , you are tring to perswade the admission officer to let you enter the college .
These is just as same as what companies doing to their coustmers by making advertisements .

Think about it , if there are two apples on the table , one is big and red while another is small and green , which one would you prefer by just looking at them ?
Of course the one that looks better !
When we are watching an advertisement , the product are often looks really good , or even better than they really are .
However , that not because the advertisement maker is cheating us , they just want us to feel better by the first looking at the product since we had never seen it before .
For example , when a professional photographor is taking pictures of a new product , say , wine , for a company , he may use the mixture of red ink and water instead of using the real wine .
Becasuse when he put the mixture under the light , it look more clear than wine and people would like these kind of things .

When people have a good first visual impress of the product , they would possiblely going to buy it , and before they really hold the product in their hands , it have nothing to do wheater the product is good or not .
Since then , advertisements have finished their job .
