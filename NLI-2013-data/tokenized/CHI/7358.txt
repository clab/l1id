There is a prevant topic about if a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel nowadays , which is undergoing serious debate because many people is affected with it in their darily free lives .
Different people hold different opinions depend on there respected sitiuation , past experience , presonality type and emotional concern .
Quite a few people hold that it is superior to choose that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling by oneself .
But others , in contrast , think that travelling with no group and no tour guide is premier option .
Nevertheless , it is not easy to make .
But if I would to choose the best one , it is advisable to follow to travel wihe a group led by a tour guide .
In the following discussion , I would like to provide some evidence to support my point of view with three denifite reasons .

Friestly , the significant reason to support my standpoint is that the tour guider can provied us many professional knowledge when we visit some seconeries , especially , the history sites .
Many facts witness and present some examples , one of all is the reason why we want to travel as we never know there places .
So it is very important to following with a guider .
He or she could tell us many stories about these palces .
I think this example will make you understand my view mo clearly .

Secondly , in my opinon , travel agency will prepare the travel bus and hotel , so it makes us more convenient .
For in stance , last year , I travel to the famous lake calld West lake with a group led by a tour guide .
When I walked all day around the large lake , I am so tired .
Then , the bus sent me to the hotel which has been perpeared .
So I could enjoy it 's comfortable rest .
If you can understand this case , you may know my view mo deeply .

Thirdly , the travel with a group could mank many new friends whe travel with us in the same group .
It is the last but not the least reason .
The true friendship needs to take much time together hours and hours .
So travel with many people is a good oppotrunity .

In conclusion , based on the discussions above .
I could belive that travel with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to us .
