Nowadays , there is a lot of mass media to convey some message to the public .
Like television & radio began on 1950's , newspapers , and since internet had developed .
It replace the kind of mass media 's position previous .
And all of them expanded as a million kinds of ways to promote the products .
But in these full of informations days , the advertisement always promote them seem much better than they really are .

One of the way to actract people to buy a product is to make it popular in a community of young people , althouth they are not the group to spend money , but they are really effective to the whole community .
For example in Hong Kong , most of the product are sell to the youngsters , and the way to make it popular is to give a trendy look to a product .
If a group of young people accept the idea of trendy , then most of them will follow , what ever how much it cost , is it really useful for them , is it worth to buy ...

The additiue they buy an item is to follow like a group of sheep , you must have one in your group of friends , or you be tease by the others , you would be out dated .

I know that the purpose of a advertisement is to convey the message to the public that the product is really good , and to show the good things of it , but most of them are really enlarged the adventages of the product , and some of the contains cheat , how much you pay is not the same with the advertisement mentioned .
It also drive me craz
