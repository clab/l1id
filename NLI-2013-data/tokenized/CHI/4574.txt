In a modern society , people always face the dilemma to believe whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not .
The problem is the much debated one in that it affects everybody in their daily lives .
People may prefer one to another , some may have no ideas about it at all .
Before rendering my opinion , I think it is necessary to take a glance at the arguments of both sides .

It is quite easy for average people to believe that most advertisements make products not seem much better than they really are .
But at a mean time , althought believeing most advertisements make products not seem much better than they rally are has some advertages , it also has many drawbacks , such as they miss the real good products .
Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that Most advertisements make products not seem much better than they really are .
What is more , the innate quality of most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , is ofter underestimated ; in other words , if you notice the invisible benefits of most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Here I would explain a few of the most important reasons .
The main reason why people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that Because of buying to many pool quality products , people do n't believe advertisements any more .
For example , my mother saw a very good make-up in the advertisements , then she brought it as a high price .
But it was n't good as it says in the advertisements .

In addition , the further reason why I admir it is that the you feel some advertisements are not real , the story of the advertisements will not happen in our lives .
To explain this point , there is an appropriate example that an story of a advertisements is talking about the talking between two cats to sell the cats food .
But you know it will not happen .

If all of the factors above are considered , we can come to the conclusion that most adbertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
People can choose better products when they notice this points .
