I definitely agree with the statement .
in my point of view .
the willingness and determination on trying new things and taking risks are significant the the successful people .
There are couple of reasons to support my view .

To begin with , i think nothing is impossible .
To make my point clearer , i mean sometimes if you do not try new things , you would not know you actually can achieve the goal .
For my own experience , i had attended an outward bound course last summer .
Everyone were forced to take a harsh task .
That was to jump into the sea on the ship .
everyone was shocked as that time as i remembered .
but in the end , all the members , including myself did finish the task .
We were all so proud of ourselves .
to other people , it seemed nothing to them .
But in our heart , we knew that it was once a successful experience we had .

Apart from that , taking risk is a MUST for you to succeed .
everything do exist a risk .
in my own experience , as i would like to improve my badminton skills in order to compete for an award in a competition , i had pay extra effort on my daily practise before i have the competition .
what is so risky to me is that , practise much more time than other normal days would have a greater chance to get injured .
at the end , of course i did n't get hurt , but it pave the way to my succeed-the champion of that competition .

Finally , i would like to raise one more example .
that is the man who invented microsoft .
when he was studying his first year in the university , he decided to left school and concentrated on developing the ideas of microsoft .
he was oringinally already good at computer and to fulfilm his dream , he ignored the risk of ca n't graduate in the university .
and of course , his development on the software was so successful that almost everyone were using the software he invented .

To conclude , if you think you ca n't achieve a goal without trying and taking risks , you will definitely not to be succeed in your future .
