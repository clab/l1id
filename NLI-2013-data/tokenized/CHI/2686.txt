Some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
Other people believe in the other way which is older people have a more enjoyable life than young people .
As far as i concern , the latter is more reasonable than the idea mentioned earlier for the following reasons .

In the first place , young people have more responsibilities , which would allow them have less time to enjoy the wonderful things in their lives , than elderly , As a older people , in a sense , there is no duty , such as rising a child , paying taxes , and educate the next generation ; on the contrary , these responsibilities are , now , weighted on the shoulders of younth .
They need to worry about many things , including how to hold their jobs .
And it is also the truth that an increasing amount of time is being spent in the work place in order to hold the position they hold now .
That means less and less time will be available for them to enjoy the life .

In the second place , older people have a more peaceful mind to enjoy the life .
These is a growing tendecy for people to lose their ambition as their age is going up .
Comparing to the young people , elderly feel more comfortable with the life they are having now ; unlike older people .
young people are always on the way to seek something better , something they think deserve better .
This makes them always on the process of chasing , leaving no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are having now .

Finally , older people can do numberous things that young people are not able to do .
With the repect for older people taking more and more important place in an increasing number of people , people now build many places only for old people , and make more entertainments for the older .
These programme are more suitable for elders .
That 's reason some of the shows can not be understood by the young people .

All in all , young people cant not enjoy their life as much as older people do beacuse they are having less time , and ambitous mind to chase others thing .
In addition , they ca n't understand something that elders do .
However , i believe that in the future , young people will enjoy life in a same amount that older people do .
