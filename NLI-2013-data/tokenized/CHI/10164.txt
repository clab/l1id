When I was young , i tired many new things and took risks of doing anything .
I tried skipping English class when I was in grade 5 , i tired yelling at my parents when I was 4 years old , and i tired copying my homeworks from others ' when I was in grade 2 .
Now i think back , and I regret .

Many people say that they should try some new things instead of following the path they already do well .
However , they still have their improvements to do the things even better .
Well is not good , perfect is good .
They should try to do their thing perfect before they try new things and take risks .
In this modern competative society , people afraid to fell off , people afraid to lose .
No one wants to be the loser or no one wants to lose their games .
Why should they have to try new things or take risks to do the things they already know how to do well ?
They should just follow their ways to go .

Taking risks or trying new things maybe is good for advance , or even get the better result .
But if they try to do perfect in the things they already how how to do well .
Somehow their results are even better , or even they will be happier .
People will praise your abilities , your knowledages , your thoughts .
Nevertheless , what if they lose when they try new things and take risks ?
They will be so upset and maybe they wo n't have any motivation to do what they already know how to do well .
The result is more harsh for them or they ca n't even take it .

So , in sum I think they shou
