Young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
yes , i agree with this opinion .
Obviously , today we enjoy our live more than older generation , because we face a differnet time .

First , with the development of our society , the young people have more chance to learn about different life in this planet by TV programs , internet or another media .
Young man always has a great interested in the new things .
They like to enjoy different life and eager to get more amazing experience .
For example , in china so many older people cost so many time to care for their grandchildren , or stay at home to watch TV .
They always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again .
but for young people , they can invite some friends to climb mountain or drive car to someplace , even though they have no much money .
They don not want to waste their time when they are young .

Second , as we all konw , in china the older generation must work harder and harder , because our parents were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family .
they spent their time in working .
when they want to enjoy the rest of life , they have already had no time or no interest about something .
but now so many young people were born in good family , they can enjoy their life as they want , because their family can afford their consum .
In recent year , so many young boy were sent to aborad to study by their parents .
under the help of their parents , they can enjoy a new life in forigen countries , they can do anything if they want to do .
That is a big differnece between young generations and older generations in china .

According to these examples , we found that the young people live in more good conditions and good famlies .
They can choose their life and enjoy more than their parents .
