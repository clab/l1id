When it comes to the pattern of the travel , some people will hold that the best way is in a group led by a tour guide .
while others believe that people with friends or travel alone , the route and the time are decided by themselves completely .
different people will be for the different pattern , depending on their personal expience , emotional concern , education background and so on .
there is no definite answer .
As far as i 'm concerned , I perfer the former .
then I will explain the reasons below .

Firstly , a travel in a group led by a tour guide will save a lot of money. a month ago , I decide to travel to HK , the first stratage is fly to HK alone , I find out the double airfee is 4000 yuan , the 3 day 's fee on hotel is about 2000 yuan , in total , it will cost 8000 yuan is this travel .
the other stratage is enroll in a group led by a tour guide , the total cost , including the airfee , the hotle fee and the pay for the guider , is only 3000 .
it is a so simple math question for me to answer .
As you kown , I make my decision easily .
the latter .

Secondly , for me , a travel means making different friends form different caree , different state , different country , with various personality , it also will help us to open our eyes , enbroad our fields , enjoy the life from different view .
in a group , you will obtain diffent even novel opinion from the member of group , when you come fonfront the difficulty , other members will give you help .
Truely , to communicate with different guys is an funny and enjoyable for us .

Thirdly , the guide will help us learn many kownledge of the new city , new sence , he/she will explain carefully the story , the histrial knowlege , which will help us to understand the new place more deeply and completely .
In expience , I have visit Su Zhou twice , the first I feel the city is just so so because I go there alone , I ca n't feel the city is beautiful .
while second time , I am guided by a guider , he explians my story about the city , I am so surprie that i find this is a mairl city .

In short , I favor the travel in a group led by a tour guide , because it will help us make more friends , hcommunication , enbroad our fields .
