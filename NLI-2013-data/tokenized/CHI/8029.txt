Some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and some people do n't think so .
In my opinoin , I agree it .
First , ideas and concepts can build a good basis .
Second , ideas and concepts can direct them to a correct way .
For the reasons , I agree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

First of all , understanding ideas and concepts can build a good basis .
If you want to do anything well , you should have a good basis , for example , building a prefect building .
In fact , when a building has a good condition , it must have a prefect basis .
Besieds , after you understand ideas and concepts , you will build a nice basis .
Plus , when you have a nice basis , you will be able to solve any problems you need .
That 's why I think ideas and concepts can build a good basis .

Moreover , understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way .
Most prblems are resulted from a incorrect way .
When you want to start a thing , the key point is that if you start from a right way .
However , most people often ignore this point .
It always makes them regret .
As a result , a good begining must have a correct way .
In fact , a correct way depends on how much ideas and concepts you understand .
That 's why I think understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way .

In conclusion , I believe that you will always make a good job when you understand ideas and concepts .
I also believe a prefect job is from a good basis and a correct way .
As a result , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
