If young people enjoy life more than the old people do ?
there may be many defferent answers according to defferrent people 's indentity exprences .
In my opinion , I do n't think that young poeple enjoy their lives more than old ones , because of several reasons following :

First of all , Young people have less time to enjoy their lives compraring to the old people .
People spend their early life on studing , working and many other things that can promise a goog future .
Old people in the other hand , almost retire from the busness that calling hard-woks , so they have a plenty of time to enjoy the live .

Secondly , young poeple , sometimes , dont't really undterstand what is the best of live , so they always spend their time on something they do n't really like .
When they think they are enjoying the live , actually , they dont't really feel happiness .
For example , many young people believe that big city can make their dreams becaming true .
They going to there to look for good job .
But always they ca n't get the job they want , because there are so many young poeple there and the competing is very sharply .
But the old men who have a lot of live exprences may be more clare whith what they want really and spend their time to get it , to enjoy it .

Finnally , old people have less pressures than yuong people .
Their yuong children have grown up , their career has completed , their life push has slowdown , so they have a release haert to enjoy the life .
Yuong poeple , on the contrast , have varis of pressures , such as childen , career and even the old parents .
They have many tast to do .
They do n't releasing heart to enjoy the life .

In a short word , the old people may enjoy their live more than yuong people do .
It is fair , because they have spend for their enjoyment during their erlier lives .
