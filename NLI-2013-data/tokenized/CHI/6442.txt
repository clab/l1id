I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In my opions , we can use internet to do many thing , there is more convinent to travel around , and in the city , you can use bus or subway to go to anyplace you want .

First of all , we can use internet to do many things .
For instance , people in the feature will work at home and use internet to do their job .
Students do n't go to school anymore , because they use internet to complete the group discussing , or find something about the assignment from teacher who teaches them through internet .

In addition , there is more convenient to travel around by taking trains or airplane .
The train or airplane will be improve .
For example , the price of the train and airplane will be very low , is anyone wants to drive by hisself or her self ?
taking the train or airplane is the more effecion than driving your own car .

Finally , in the city , you can use bus or subway to go to anyplace you want .
If you own a car , you will pay huge tax about the car , and drive it out foe few times .
It is waste money .
the money sould be use in other better way .
Futhermore , in japan , they usually go to the train station by riding bicyle , it is very convient less pollusion , and good for healthy .

In summary , we can ous internet to do many things .
Moreove , there is more convenient to travel around by taking train to airplane .
Finally , you can go to anyplace by taking bus or subwar .
There is trhree important reasons to support that I agree with in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There is only one earth , we should take care of it throu
