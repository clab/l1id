If you have a choice to travel around the country , will you go along by yourself or travel in a group ead by a tour guide ?
As for me , I will take the second answer and I believe this the best way to use in the travel , for the following reasons :

First and fore most , traveling in a group and accompanied by a tour guide gives me more knowledge and pleasure in my tour .
Compare to travelling alone , the tour guide may tell us more background information , stories of the sighting and also introduces many local cultrual matters or traditional habits .
These great information certainly enhences my trip and makes me be knowledgalbe to where I have been visited .

In addition , it is suah a good way to use my money and time wisely in the tour .
Travelling in a group will absolutely save my money and time .
For instance , other group members and I share the same bus , we book the hotel with lower price and our schedule is highly planed before we go .
Thes significant parts offers me a more economic travel than my travelling alone .

Last but not the least , it makes me meeting a lot of new friends in my tour group and my travel is full of fun .
It is benificial for travelling together with others rather than by oneself alone simply because I make friend with our group members and share the happiness with them .

In a conclusion , travelling in a group and being led by a tour guide is the best way to experience and enjoy my tour .
