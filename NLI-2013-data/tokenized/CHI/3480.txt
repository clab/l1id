Somebody sais : Young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with that for sure .
First , young people always busy for their own business such as hand out with friends , spend few time to do the homework , spent time on the cell phone to know what happen with their friends today , watching TV and play video game etc .
It 's not kind of selfish but they just do n't care about other thing which does n't matter to them , for example , so something helping communities .

Second , except young people do n't want to spent time on helping communities .
They do n't understand why they have to , or what can they get from doing that thing .
However , cause young people to do n't care about too much thing it might because they do n't ever know how is the feel to helping cimmunities and helping people also .
They might would like to helping communites after they know that is more interesing than playing video games and talking on the cell phone .
