Some people think young people should enjoy life more than older people .
On the other hand , some people belive that older people should enjoy life more than younger people .
In my views , I think the second view is that I like .
Because the following advantages will be supply .

First of all , the older people have a lot of time to spend , For example , when the older people retired from their job , they can use it to other palce that do not delay their work .
But if younger people do it , they must affect their job .
For example , if older people want to beach , they can go at once .
They have a lot of time to prepare the all things , and they can use their time to slow drive .

Additionally , the older people have enough money .
They do not worry the cost .
The younger people should take care their future .
So they must save .
For instance , if young people do not save money , they can not affort the cost of house .
They also lose their future .

Finally , if the younger people enjoy life specially , that will result they do not connect with their friends .
That is very bad thing .
For example , some young people make illeage thing because they want to enjoy life extremely .
We should encouge the young people study more and more .

According the above metioned , I think young people do not enjoy life more than older people .
They should study more .
When they are old , they can enjoy life more .
