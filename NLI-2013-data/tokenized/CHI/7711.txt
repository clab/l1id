Some people like to attaind a tour group led by a tour guide when traveling .
However , others like to plan the iternirary and do the pre-trip information research by themselves .
In my point of view , if one wants to have the awesome travel experience , travelling alone would be the best choice .

First , when traveling in a group , you do n't have much choices .
Much time of the case you encountered is that a bounch of tourists crowed in front of the painting or relic and listened the lecture addressed by the tour guide .
The quality of lecture may vary between tour guides and you do n't have much choice about what you can see or where you can visit .

Another reason why traveling alone is better than joining tour group is that you will become the tour expert when you come back home .
You can enjoy every deatils from the very begining of trip planing to every moments you spent during the trip .
You may do more background information for the spots that you have interest .
It is not what a tour guide can do for you .
The way of tour guide 's leading may not fit your taste perfectly .

One of main reason that people choice join tour group is that when facing accident during trip , they need somesone can help them .
But , sometimes even a tour guide may also not the local resident .
When accident occurs , tour guide is also in the same situation as we are .
If we do the information collection by ourselves in advance , we can have more confidence when faceing accident

After considering the reasons above , the best way to travel is travelling alone .
You can have much more controle over your iternirary and you can learn more about the spots you have interset .
