Whether young people enjoy life more than older people do or not draws a complex issue on the topic .
Some people may say the youth have a lot of fun , but the old does not .
While the others may oppose this oppinion .
If I have to choose an view , I will personally support the former claim .

First of all , Young people got more opportunities to have fun from various aspects of the society than the old people do .
People usually take it for granted that the conception of young means having fun , which is why our society provides more facilities for the youth to do so .
For example , the manufatures produce various toys for babies , children , and even young adaults .
More over , many topics on TV concerns with the young , seldomly with the old .
When I turn on my TV , I can find out a bounch of childen chanals as interesting as Disney .
Especially , in some county , like China , there is only one child in a family .
So both of the parents and grandparets will love her or him as precious as an apple , and provide her or him all kinds of oppertunities to have fun .

Additionally , young people have a lot of energy and less responsibilies , which is easier for them to have fun .
On the other hand , the old has to earn money in order to sustain the family .
For instance , my father always looks tired after he comes home from his office and then he even refuse himself to have fun with me , which makes me very upset .
As a wise man said ( and I paragragh ) , ''
Time is money , and time is treasure '' .
These words make those adaults and olds think that I can not to wast their time to have fun at all , which might not be totoally correct .

Admittedly , our society provides the old people more and more oppertunities and encourage them to have fun , especially then they get retired .
After retiring , more and more old people feel boring and lonely at home .
So they try to make more and more oppertunities for themselves to have fun .
The city government ususally orgnize Senior Clubs which includes gym facilities , dance center , and so no .
Even do n't mention the chess clubs , sing clubs , ...
ect .
In sum , now those old have got more and more opportunities to have fun .

All in all , I basically agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Inevitably , more and more opportunities are provided by the society for those old to entertain themself .
Now , we can say that both the youth and the old are apt to enjoy their lives in many aspects .
