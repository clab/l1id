A broad knowledge or specialize in one subject ?
In the 21st centry , we face the more chanllage and more chance than when we lived before .
Many new trouble we will meet .
At this time we have to need know more to control these problems .
So I think a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject .

At first , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help us enjoy our life .
I have a friend named Jack he is good at the computer , this is not important , the most surprise me is he can play the guitar very well .
He always be happy , no matter how hard trouble he met .
As far as I know many sicentist is good at music .
They never complain the life , just enjoy it .
You see may be two different kind of knowledge can make us do the better .

Secondly , if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , then it easy to find jobs , even if you be fired , you never be scared .
In the company , we may meet the strong compete , in this case you want keep your work you have to do sonething not belong you , can you image a boss will fire a good helper that he can help he do verything ?
Of course no !
In any case you be fired , you can find the good job soon may be in another erea .

Finally , have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make you more clearly who you are , and where are you go !
You know more than others mean you have more chance to decise what would you want .
It is better for your devolpment .
At that time you can choose one you like most , than to work hard on it , you will succeed more quickly !
So , I agree with it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
