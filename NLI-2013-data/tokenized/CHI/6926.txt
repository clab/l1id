I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I hold this point of view because of the surging of the global population , the expansion of the urban cities , and the research of the invention of future cars .

First of all , it is clear that the number of the global population is dramatically increasing by looking at the demographic charts .
The number of people may soon reach its peak and it means that there will be more and more people that their transportational necessaries should to be met .
And it can also observed that in many prosperous areas , one family may have more than a car in their garages .
So the accelarating of the number of human will result in the intense need of cars .

Secondly , since there are more and more fellow men who settle down and pursue their lives in cities , the brink of cities have extended , forming the so-called metropolis and this phenomanon shows that many people dwelling in the outskirts or suburbs of urban cities will need cars to access the core area of cities due to the distances from outer places to the business or entertainment centers and the convenience that cars bring about .

Thirdly , because of the exhausion of the fossil fules , many scientists or coporations are now eager to research in the field of renewable energy and seek to invent environmentally friendly green cars that utilize bioenergy , electricity or solar energy .
Since the further research and the actively invetion of green car , how can the number of cars be decreasing in twenty years .
Accordingly , there will be more and more cars on the roads , no matter what appearances they may have .

As a whole , in twenty years there wo n't be fewer and fewer cars in use .
Conversely , what with the explosion of the global population , the swelling of the big cities and the enthusiasm for producing future vehicles , cars will still on demand .
