I agree that it would be betther to have diversified knowledge in many fields , rather than focusing on a particular subject .
In many universities around the world , the idea of providing all-rounded education for students has been promoting in recent years , which would be the proof of a need of having broad knowledge .

There are several reasons supporting my view .
First , the boundaries of subjects sometimes are difficult to be distinguished since most subjects have connections with the others .
For instance , the learing of accounting would also require some computer skills since accounting nowadays is not confined to manual work .
Therefore , if we have already accumulated fundamental knowledge on the use of specific softwares like MYOB , it would definitely help learn the core subject more effectively .

Second , we would always encounter people from different streams of study and different knowledge , and therefore if we have knowledge in the other fields , it would be easier for us to start a conversation and learn from the others .
We would know the philosophy of different kinds of people since people often developed their logic based on their knowledge and experience learnt from their field of study .
Hence , we may find it easy to cooperate with the others when working in the society .

Last but not least , it would help us develop critical thinking skills with accumulating knowledge in other fields .
If we only concentrate on studying our own major subjects , our thinking and ideas would be confined to a particular route .
Take the subjects of economics and accounting as an example , in economics , students would be taught that assets would be determined on cash basis .
However , throughout the learning of accounting , students would be exposed to accrual concept , which is to recognize our future revenues as our income at the moment .
From the above example , we can see that students with both economics and accounting knowlege may be exposed to disimilar ideas on the related topic , so that they would learn more about the incompleteness of specific subjects .

All in all , we would become all-rounded if we can receive fundamental knowledge in numerous field .
The more diverse the knowledge we have , the less difficulty we would have during our learning and working .
