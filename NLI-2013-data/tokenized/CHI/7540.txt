How do you make a travelling ?
Quite a few people prefer travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
They believe that it it time saving and more effienciet .
As to me , I do n't think it is the best way to travel , to be frankly , I prefer to arrange a travel by myself .

I do believe travelling is a kind of way to enjoy life , to spend sweet time with the family , the lover .
It is such a time .
You can make schedule yourself , the destination , accomodation , departure time , everything you like , as flexible as you want , no need to catch fast pace arranged by the tour agent , do n't worry about to rush to next destination , everything is so flexible to under your control .
I love that feeling .

Another good benefit of travelling alone is , I think , it is possible for me to know more about the place , the local culture , the people , the special customs , etc .
Because I do have more time and opportunities to do many things I am interesting .
I can manage the time to stay , the place to go , so much funny things .

One more important benefit of travelling alone is the economic aspect .
I can manage the travelling schedule by myself , choose the flight , the hotel at reasonalbe price .
Everything is under my budget control .

In a word , I prefer travelling alone .
