I agree broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

When I was a child , my parents want me to study a lot of things .
For example , except that I study my lesson , and must play the piano , learn dancing and ride a horse .
They want me to become a broad knowledge people .
They think there are three reasons .

The First .
When you grown up , you may make some people or recognize a little person .
Different people you should speak different words .
So you should ues different knowledge .
If you just know a specific subject .
you can not play with some different kinds of people .
you do not know what you should said and what your some different friends want to hear .
For example , my friend want to make a friend that is a America girl , .
But my friend does not understand English , So at last my friend does not make a friend with a America girl .

The second and the important .
If you know broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you can have more chance of job than specialize in one speciflc subject .
Because you know different knowledge you can work in different envieroment and recognize different people even increasing your another knowledge .
For example , If you know English , you can work in U.S.A or England and a lot of countries .
If you just know chinese you may work just in china .

So you lose a lot of chance .

So I think better to have broad knowledge of many academic subje
