When people think of successful people , they think of a person who is willing to try new things and taking risks in life , a person who always jumps out of the comfort zone where he or she is so used to .
I completely agree with this statement .

In the business realm , new oppotunies are always there but lie in the hidden , unknown and risky areas .
Many people may see the oppotunity , but only successful ones are willing to take the risk to explore it .
Nowadays everyone is talking about the double-digit ecnomic growth of China and I believe no one on earth can not see the oppotunities there .
However , only a small handful of them could actually take the action to jump into this unkown territory and strike great success .

When students graduate from college , they usually think of finding a job related to their major .
Rarely do we see students are willing to explore new domains or unknown areas for more oppotunities .
However , it is usually from these small group of students who are willing to experiment new things where successful people emerge .
Take my personal experience as an example .
When I graduated with a computer engineering degree , I did not go routinely to search for an IT or engineering job , but instead , I jumped into a very new field called `` Bioinformatics '' by spending another two years in graduate schools for a master degree .
It was a daring move at that time because there was virtually zero `` Bioinformatics '' industry in the country I live in .
However , two years later , I embraced the prosperous of the field .

Our society needs all kinds of people .
Sometimes we can not judge a person 's success by measuring how much money he or she earns .
There are many great successful people out there doing notable work to our society , the poor people and the environment .
Many of them had their careers , and had lived their life comfortably .
But they did not choose to live on that way , but jumped out of the comfortable zone and did something more marvelous .

In conclusion , with all the above discussions and examples made in different domains , I totally agree with the statement that successful people are those who are willing to experimenting new things and taking risks .
