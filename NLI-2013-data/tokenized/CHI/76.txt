Young People Enjoy Life As Older People Do
In my opinion , old people enjoy their life as the young people .
In some cases , old people will more enjoy their life than young people .
Because they truly know that so precious is time that they can not affort to waste it .

Some people will think that so old is the elder person , they can not do anything .
But I don not agree with them .
The elder people can also have a colourful life .
Besides , they can do anything they like to do .
For instances , they can go to dance with their partner in the old people assosiation , going to sing is also a good idea for them .
By going out , they can make more friends and be happier .
Sometimes , elder people can go to the children 's house to have a visit or walk in the park .
As a teenager , we should take care of the elder people , which is our responsebility .

Of course , young people also have their paradise .
There is no denying that the most important things is that studying .
As a studet , nothing is more important than to receive the education .
It is our responsebility to study well .
Furthermore , the teenagers can also have some thing you like to do after school .
Such as do some sports , go shopping , do some reading , or listen to the music .
Addicting to the computer games is not a good thing , or spending the time in drinking beer is also not good at the childern 's growing .

In a word , we must value our time and life , both the young people and the old people .
