Older people always say that young people are always busy with making money and doing their job , which prevent the young people to enjoy their life .
I admit that older people , especially those people who retire , have much more time to enjoy their life .
However , since the young people are healthier than the older man , there is no limitation to young people 's activities .
Furthermore , young people have much more entertainment than the old ones and young people can more easily communicate with others and chat with others .
Therefore , I think young people can enjoy the life better .

First , young people is healthier than the older ones .
It means that young people can travel to any place which interests them .
For example , they can climb to the top of famous mountains , sail into the ocean and walking into the middle of rain forest .
Moreover , They can also play basketball and football with each other while older people will get very tired in the competitaion games .
Therefore , young people can enjoy life more than old ones becuase they are healthier than the older ones .

Second , young people have much more entertainment than those of the older ones .
Young people can go to bars and restaurants after work .
They chat with friends and enjoy the delicious food such as Chinese food and Mexigan food in the restaurants while older ones will prefer to stay at home and being alone .
Furthermore , the young people can have dating with their girl/boy friends .
They watch movies , listen to the performance in the concert and go to see the beautiful landscape together .
Young people can even have fun by playing the same mmo games such as world of warcraft .
They form guilds in the game and they meet in the game and play game together .
Thus , young people can enjoy their life more than older ones becuase they have much more entertainment .

Third , young people enjoy communicating with each other in the internet .
Many young people enjoy chatting with their friends with msn or other softwares .
They can tell jokes to their friends when they are working in the office .
Those jokes can make their office hours more interesting .
Furthermore , even when two young people are far in distance , they can easily talk with each other .
They just need to have a computer and they can put on the microphone and use the network services to talk .
Those examples show that young people enjoy their life better than the old ones by talking with others more easily .

In conclusion , though older people have much leisure time than the young ones , they are so confined by their health and their life style which limits them to have more entertainment and communicate frequently with others .
Thus , young people are beneficial from their healthy , their various entertainment and their communication with others .
As a result , young people can enjoy life more than older ones .
