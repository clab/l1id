When asked about what kind of knowledges is good for a person 's life .
Many people may hold the issue to learn as much as specialized knowledeg in one specific subjuect and think that is a prime argument .
But , some people , however , are taking a fresh look at it .
As far as I am concered , I agree with that it is better to have broad knowlege of many acadeemic , although there may several merits to specialize in one sepecific subject , for example , more expertized and more deeply knowledge .
Among countless reasons that influence my opinion , there are three conspipuous aspects mentioned follow .

We may look into every possbile reason , however , the foremost one is that a broad knowledge is good for fitting to the developing of the world today .
Nowadays , people could get as much as informations from many different methods .
They should have the ability to be familiar to huge informations and treat them correctly .
And if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must owe many different knowledge of a great deal of subjects .

Also , it may be arbitrary to juge my preference only to use the argument mentioned in the above paragraph .
There is another reason that deserves some words here .
For individule perspectivity , a broad knowledge will give person more choices for career .
They can choose many different areas to develop their own business .
And they can use the broad knowledges to help them make more successes and that will be much easier for them to exert the broad knowledge in a whole .

Last but not the least reason is that the broad knowlege will give person more opportunities to meet different people with different academic backgrouds .
They will communicate with them more freely , and may make friends with them that will be good for their future lives and careers .

Taking into account of all these reasons mentioned above , we may easily reach the conclusion that it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,
