In the recent years , many educators , parents and students have discussed how the students learn more efficiently and effectively .
There are two different philosophy that has been proposed in this hot topic .
One is to understand ideas and concepts and another one is to learn facts .

Most western countries like United States and Canada , the teachers encourage the students to understand ideas and concepts first .
The teaching approach is not bound to the fact that the students do not urge to remember a lot of information and facts from the textbooks .
For example , the teachers try to use some daily examples to explain some concepts in science such as physics , chemistry and biology .
At the same time , the students can develop their own creative , innovative and troubleshooting ability .
Meanwhile , it is good for the students to be capable of brainstorming in this very competitive communities .

In the other hand , most eastern countries such as China , Japan and so , the teachers prefer to ask the students to remember a lot of facts and information so as to build up their fundamental basis on their study .
However , most of the students cannot advocate their interest in their study .
In addition , the students are not willing to accept more new concepts or they are not able to develop any novel ideas in their study .
For example , the students are good at memory , but not on any innovation or troubleshooting issues in their living either .
Thus , it is not an effective and flexible way for them to deal with the difficulties and hurdles that they really face in the reality .

To be concluded , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
This approach would be more beneficial to the students in order to encounter and survive in this competitive world .
