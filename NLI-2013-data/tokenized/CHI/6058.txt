Cars are one of the modern transportations nowadays , which are commonly used by everyone .
Cars can make our lives easier by saving our time and energy .
As cars are getting more and more commonly used , the energy needed for the cars is getting lesser and lesser .
As in result , energy crisis occurs , and which becomes one of the most important daily issues to us .
I believe in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because of the scarcity of energy , and the innovation of technology .

It is obvious that there are more and more cars on the streets nowadays .
But has anyone awares the huge lost of energy ?
Probably not .
Cars will not work without gasolines .
As more and more gasoline is purchased , it becomes more scarced .
In economics view , when a good or service is getting scarced , the price of the individual good or service will increase .
That is what 's happening to the gasolines nowadays .
As the price of gasoline rises , the living expense also increases .
In the end , people will not use cars as common as we do now .
And this is because of the scarcity of energy needed for the cars .

When the situation of scarcity of the the energy is happening , people tend to find many ways to solve this problem .
The innovation of transportation might be the solution to this problem .
Scientists who work on energy developement might create new energy instead of the traditional energy , gasoline .
With the help of these scientists , the solution will either be having new forms of energy , or new forms of cars that consume less gasoline .
Therefore , traditional cars will no longer be used in twenty years .

In conclusion , the scarcity of energy and the innovation of technology can reduce the number of cars in the next twenty years .
Scarcity of energy leads to the rise of living expense , which will finally force people not to use cars as much as they do now .
The innovation of technology will help developing new forms of energy that will not be used by cars , and new tools of transportation other than cars .
Therefore , I believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the next twenty years .
