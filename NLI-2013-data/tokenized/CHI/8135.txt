A survery was curried out that weather it is more important for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn facts .
There are a large number of people belive that it is more imprtant for student to understand ideas : on thr other hand , only a small amount of people who think that lt is more important for them to learn facts .
in my opinion , I tend to stand on the side of majority .

First of all , the first reason why I agree with the idear is taht it is important for student to understand what they have learned .
For instens , if a student do not understand what he just learned , he could not pass the text in his classes .
in the same way , he can not get enough credit and he can not have a good future.a student even do not have the bsic knownlege , how could he learn fats ?

Alouthgh , the first reasons i mentioned is a important reason , but it is not the only reason to examplan , the second reason also
