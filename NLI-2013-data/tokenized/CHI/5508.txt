No matter where you go , you 'll always be confronted with huge commercial signs .
Even your favorate television programmes are filled with subtle advertising tricks .
The huge amount of commercials and the way in which the products are presented has often made me wonder if the products are truely as amazing as they look .
And I often come to the conclusion that most products truely are too good to be true .
The advertisements make them better than they really are .

First of all , you must keep in mind that the advertisement serve for one purpose and one purpose only and that is selling the product , no matter what .
In order to do so , advertisers tend to exaggerate and brag .
By telling amazing stories about the products , they try to sell them .
Of course , nobody wants to buy ordinary products that have no use anyway .

Besides , there are a lot of products of the same kind in the markets .
So there need to be distinction between them .
People want to know which one is the best , because everyone wants only the best of the best .
And a lot of advertisements do make a product extraordinary .
Take the commercials for make-up for example .
People often tend to buy overprized make-up rather than the cheap ones .
That 's because they see and hear celebrities talk about those ` amazing ' cosmetic products .
I 'm sure you 've seen Andie Mcdowell starring in the L'Oreal commercials promoting facial cream : `` This will definitely make your rincles dissappear .
You 'll see instant results !
This is the best ! ''
It perhaps really is n't the best facial cream , or even different from the other creams , but the celebrity makes it special .

Finally , modern technology plays a big roll in the scheme .
the use of photoshop has made people and products look better and prettier than they really are .
It 's very easy to manipulate pictures .
And the advertisers know that .
It 's so commonly used nowadays , that you will hardly find any ` natural ' pictures anymore .

It 's always fun to watch the commercials , though .
Seeing how the companies have outdone themselves again and again .
They always find new ways of entertaining the audience , trying to get your attention .
Having singing children and perfect families playing in the commercials .
They 're fun to watch , but they 're definitely not representative for th

So all with all , be very cautious when buying products .
Do n't buy everything the commercials tell you to buy , as these products are often too good ot be true !
Remember that these adds are often misleading and exaggerated .
The advertisers want you to buy their products and will do anything to get them sold .
Using modern technology and paying celebrity , they manipulate the public opinion .
Enjoy the commecials , but do n't let them fool you .
