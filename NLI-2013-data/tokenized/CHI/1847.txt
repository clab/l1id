Differences between generations have been public concerns , even put into debates for a long time .
Among which there exists a widely discussed one - whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Needless to say , the answer varies from person to person .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the above statement not only because young people appreciate diversity more , but also because they are more welcome to new things .

To begin with , with the development of human civilization , especially now globalization is an undeniable trend , diversity is increasingly acceptable and admired .
There are examples everywhere .
Young people , generally speaking , enjoy traveling to different places .
They are fascinated by diverse cultures and people they meet .
However , older people tend to stay in one place , and even hate changes .
In that case , their enjoyments are not comparable to their young counterparts .

In the second place , in contrast to older people. , young generation are more willing to accept novelties and enjoy them .
For instance , a couple of days ago , I was in the roller coaster in Bejing Amusing park .
It is an exciting experience , a challenge both pysically and mentally .
However , my parents just looked away and would not give a try .
Therefore , it is a pity that they never enjoy those thrillers in life , which are taken advantages by us young .

Nevertheless , to be fair , older people are blessed with their own merits .
On one hand , they pay more attention to details in life , which enable them to find out beauty in the somewhat mundane world .
On the other hand , they are more easily to be satisfied , thus feel more grateful to life , even if they are in adversity .

In a nutshell , despite all the advantages enjoyed by older people , I will not hesitate to side with the statement that life is more enjoyable to young .
My conclusion is based on the fact that young people are happier with new experiences .
Further more , diversity are held in higher regard in youths .
Therefore , modern society is more appealing to them .
However , we can never deny that every person enjoys his or her own happiness and blessings , which has not much to do with his or her age .
As long as we develop a genuine appreciation for life itself , life is definitely more beautiful .
