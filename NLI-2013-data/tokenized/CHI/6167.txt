With the swift and tremendous development of industry , people are making every effort to enjoy life .
In the mean time , the industrial growth also brings huge damages to human living conditions .
The air pollution produced by over use of vehicles is a warn that people should cut down on the application of them , which leads me to believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the abuse of cars has caused severe environmental issues .
Many people have been in possession of cars for quite a long time .
They travel by car , go to work in a car , and even discuss commercial transactions in the moving status since it is an efficient way to promote the dealings .
However , it is commonly realized that gasoline consumption may lead to undoubtedly serious environmental problems including but not limited to air pollution and infectious diseases concerning lung functions .
The gas emitted by the engine is a detriment to human living surroudings , which can damage human lungs , limiting the function of breathing to carry adequate oxygen to every part of huamn bodies .
On the other hand , such emitted gas can drift in the air for a long time possibly becoming the excellent medium for the growth of bacteria .

Furthermore , nowadays , more and more people are wary of the problems caused by cars .
People , aiming at sustainable development , are undergoing a lot of measures to control the damages .
Scientists are conducting experiments to evaluate the results of car produced gas .
Service workers are promulgating the latest or maybe recent findings of them to guide people in a correct direction -- decrease the use of cars .

People can also enhance their health by other alternatives of cars .
They may practise their strength and endurabililty by riding or running in stead of driving .
In this way , people force themselves to use their own muscles and energies which is a both economic and effective way to improve their health and weight loss , a popular issue , may also be realized .

In a word , in my view , use of cars will become less and less in 20 years in that it results in rigid environmental damages , and people may become healthier by abandoning cars despite that cars without gasoline consumption may be produced out in a mass since the use of cars may increase human weight , causing a lot of problem relating to blood pressure and heart functions .
