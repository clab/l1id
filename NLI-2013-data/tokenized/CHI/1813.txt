I disagree this statement .
The young and the older people are both enjoy life .
First of all , the young people are lively .
They have a lot of time and energy to sdudy , which is the most exciting thing in one 's life .
The young people will benifit from it .
The second , in the spare time , young people have plenty of energy and time to play basketball , to dance , to sing , and also chat on-line .
As a younger , I like to make freinds on-line , you can talk with many diffrent kinds of people , and it will be make my life more intersting .
The young people can enjoy a lively , busy and exciting life .

The older people can enjoy their own life too .
Maybe they do not have enough energy to play crazily like the young people .
But they have more time to do some calm and slow exercise , such as taijiquan .
If a older person has a good healthy , he or she may go to swim , it intrersting and make one 's strong .
My grandfather is a happy and health older man .
He like do sports , and every morning he go to swim with his old freinds .
The plenty of exercise he takes make him lively as a young man .
His life is bueatieaful , andI want to have this kind of life when I am old .
So the older people can enjoy his lovely life .

That is why i disagree the statnm
