I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In out real life , although we often travel with a tour guide , it is more fun to discover the excitment covered by the mask of the place you visit all by yourself .
Some of you might say that it is more fun to travel with a tour since you are not familiar with the place you are going to , but what I think is that traveling with a tour actually does n't give you more information about the local buildings or spot you are visiting than just travel by yourself .
If a finalized , perfect travel has to be accomplished , one has to collect all the information one needs and starts the unmasking discovery adventure not just paying lots of money and have to waiting for the buses in the morning and later found out that someone has troubles with the payment and the schedule is delayed .
Traveling with a guide tour usually has no personal space during the schedule .
Going with people scrambling together cannot genrantee your individual actions might be appropriate to others .
You might want to do some break dances during the break or listen to the music loudly , but there is always someone in your group might disagree with your actions .
You might experience peacefulness while you are along , and so does traveling .
If you travel with a group , you might have to endure the noise surrounding you since there are people talking or doing their personal stuff that you probably would explode and start complaining ; on the other hand , if you travel along , the problem does not exist anymore .
Accidents has more chances to happen between people than a person along , according our history that mobs are usually the headache of the government and accidents happen more frequently within the unstable group .
So if one traveled along , he might get a happy trip after the day off , but if one traveled with a group led by a tour guide , there absolutely will be accidents such as people missing , people fighting , or someone falls into the water and break his leg .
The last benefit provided by traveling along is no time restriction .
Since it is all by your own , you are the tour guide , it is you who decided where the trip is taking place and how the trip is going to be .
Traveling along has more benefits than traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide .
