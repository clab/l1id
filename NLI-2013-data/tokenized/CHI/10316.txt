I agree with the statement that successful people have more brave to take risks than they is doing the same thing all the time .
Personally , people want to be successful .
They should have creative ideas in nowadays .
The fact is that trying to face challenge and establish their own idea can help people boost their business easier and enjoy the ideal life .

To begin with , trying news things and taking risks make it posssible for people to boost their own business .
There is no doubt that the world is changing all the time .
If people still stick to so what they already know , it is almost impossible to make a living in the competition of the market today .
Through creativity and challenge , people can amass riches much more easier .
For example , Bill Gaze are not graduated at Harvard Univerity .
However , he becomes one of the richest people in the world .
What assist him to be successful is an important issue to discuss .
He uses his own ideas and has brave to take risks to build up Microsoft which allows everyone to immerse in the digital world .
Whithout his creativity and spirit , people can not enjoy the convieient life .

In addition , creation and challenge make it possible for people to enjoy the ideal life .
Doubtless , people try to invent new things in the world .
Without people 's new idea , others ca n't enjoy their life all the time .
For example , some artist and composers try to create new style paintings and poems , although during the time people do n't think their work are masterpieces .
However , many names of Van Gogh and Shakespears are foever engraved in people 's collective memory .
It allows people today to read their meaning fulpoems and paintings .
Without their brave and trying to do new things , we can not enjoy the ideal life and see their masterpieces .

To sum up , some people would rather to keep their traditional idea and do the same thing all the time .
However , I choose differently .
The reason is that risks and trying new things make people more sucessfully .
