i strongly agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , i have 2 reasons to surport my argument which are `` parent are busy '' and `` only forcus on study ''

firstly , the nowadays ecolomy increase , parents are usually need to work , some parents could be work over 10 hours per day 5 more days per week , the reason for this , they do n't really have enough time to talk or communicate with their child .
in my opinion the young people 's communities sill mainly come from their parents , they do n't talk with their parents , shell they talk with another people automaticly ?
i do n't think so .

secondly , most people from nowadays forcus on study , they study at school more over than 8 hours , some students probably spend more hours study after school , 24 hours mines 8 hours to sleep and mines more than 10 hours to study ?
how can they learn communities ?
everyone believe study is most importand because is helpful for the future , but they forget the humen is sort of group working class , can you suriver only yourself ?

finally , i believe that nowadays young people do n't have much time to learn their communities and it will become very shy not as lievily as before .
so my comment for this is i think parents have to spend some time to talk with their children to improve their communities skill instead send them to school or only study at home , and also we need to teach them not only study is main but also to communicate with another people is also important .
