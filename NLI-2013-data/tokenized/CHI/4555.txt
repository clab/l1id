Nowadays the advertisement ( ad ) is one of popular methods for producers to promote the sale of the products .
However , the information of the ad intrigues a ferece debate whether the inforamtion in the ad is authentic and believable .
Some people think that the ad has the strong tendency to exaggerate the function and effect of products for attracting the user 's eyes .
Other people would like to agree that the false ad is impossible at modern society for that such behavior make the industry face high risk .
In my point of view , the information in the advertisement is credibable because the deceiptive commercial behavior will cause the severe damage once the misconduct is confirmed by society or government .

First of all , the producer has no the necessicity to take the false strage to tempt the customers .
the maind purpose of ad taken by producers is to release the product information for enhancing the product sale .
Normally more invest on the product more sale increase with the corresponding the profit .
So most of merchants , especially the famous international productors , have no the will to intentionally exaggerate the information in their ad .

Second , the contents of ad are seriously governed by the offical government .
There is law specific for the ad to manage the ad behavior , especially against the false content ad .
Before releasing the ad content has been subjected to the governmental check .
Also the the ad company such as TV station will do some survey to confirm the truth of the information provided by the producters .
Therefore , it is hard for the producers to find the chance to publish their overexaggerated ad .

Third , the misconduct by false ad will cause great loss for the producers .
Once the false content in ad has been found and confirmed , the company will get the direct punishment from the government due to inviolation of the law .
Moreover , the company will not be accepted by the traditional customers , which will further make the producer loss the market .

To summerize , no producer have the bravey to do the false ad and run high risk to do such misconduct .
so we should trust most the ad in no all .
