I agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In hte modern society , there are more and more entertaining resorts for young people to enjoy .
Such as Wonderland in Canada , bars and club .
The most important thing is young people 's ages and hearts .

As the economics increase all over the world , everything is changing .
The buildings , people 's dresssing , cultures , fashioness , and transportation .
The reason the world is developing is all because the way modern thinking are changing .
People 's lives are getting better and better every day , especially young people , since they live more in modern society .
They have not esperienced the life during wartime .
For example , the American scientific engineers are focusing on project about the building the longest abd excited train in the world .
The train is very similar to the one we often play in Wonderland .
And of courses it is more likely oftered to young people .
I actually do n't that pld people can not go to that train to experience the happiness and excitedment .
But use our common to think about it , if we do a survey in a city , we can calculate the percentage , how much percent of old people like to go to those places to have fun compare to young people ?
Even though they actually go , i believe they will bring the kids or grandchildren there .

This is another example , in North America , they build more and more bars and clubs only for young people , but for this situation , they have age limit , from age sixteen to eighteen .
This is a very vivid example shows that the society cares about the young people about enjoying their lives and have fun .

However , we do care about the old people as well .
They would like to enjoy their lives and have fun too .
But the way they enjoy their lives compare to young people , it is more silent .
Instead going to those resorts , they rather just invite some friends to their houses to have some drink or just watch newpapers at home .

In then modern society , young people really enjoy life more than old people .
