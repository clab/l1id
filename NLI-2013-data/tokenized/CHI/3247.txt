I personally agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time in helping their communities .
I for one feel that I myself do not spent enough time helping others .
Many young people has already forgotten about their communities , forgotten that that are other people besides themselves , forgotte that the community needs their help and is more than happy to receive a helping hand from them .

Many young people nowadays are more self absorbed than back then .
They have learned to be more self driven to their own goal regardless of the sacrifices and so on .
They learned about individuality and competition .
They do not realize the importance of helping their communities .
Although there are many public awareness campaign on this issue but it is not enough to drive the young people to help their communties .

Most of the young people are more concerned with social status than anything else these days .
They are preoccupied with being popular than to see what the communities need .
They see community service as a task or chore or a boring thing to do rather than a healthy and honorable action .
They do not picture this as a cool thing to do and it is probably not on their prioirity list .
They do not see the bigger picture of the society and that others may need a helping hand .

Young people nowadays also has much more source of entertainment , for example there is the wide usage of the computer these days .
Most young people spend most of their time on the computer .
They are surfing the internet for information , they are using the computer to communicate with others , to play games as well as to obtain other source of entertainment .
Other source of entertainment such as shopping malls , coffee joints , clubs and bars have more appeal to the young people nowadays rather than helping the community .
Due to the time spent on electroninc gadgets such as computers , and entertaining themselves with other activities such as going out with friends to malls and so on , young people have limited free time to help put their communities .
They forget the traditional ways of communicating and helping their communities .

In conclusion , the priorities of young people nowadays has changed .
They tend to forget to put in helping others as one of their priorities as they are very much goal oriented , individualized and have many source of entertainment these days .
Hopefully the young people will one day realize this and change their behaviors .
