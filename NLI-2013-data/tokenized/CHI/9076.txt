Depending on the personal experience , personalities types and emotional concerns , different person will have different opinions on whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In my eyes I strongly believe that learning facts is more useful .
In other word , I disagree with the statement .
I have several reasons for my propensity .

The main reason is that only though learning facts would people get to know the ideas , concepts and the truth .
Thoughout the history , all the ideas is come from the obervations of facts .
Nobody could come to any kinds of conclusion without the research and the acumulation of data .
For example , Newton discover the rule of gravity from observe the apples falling from the tree .

Another reason canbe see by everybody is that thoery will not be able accepted without the detail and facts .
Why does most scientists conduct millions of experiments ?
Because they try to find the supports of their ideas .
Thus , it is more important for students to learn facts .
That 's all the reason why in the school experiment courses are provided .

Finally , learn facts is necessary for us to discover more ideas and concepts .
This world is still full of mysteries .
We need to solve them and find out the reasons , in other words , to get access to new thoery .
Only following the concepts gives by old people , never will our society develop .

We ca n't deny the importance of understanding thoery , for the are the truth of the world and very helpfull to solve problems .
However , those ideas was come from facts the scientist learned .

All in all , considering all the factors above , we can easily draw the conclusion that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .
