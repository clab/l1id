There is a recently discussion about if young people enjoy life more than old people do or not .
As far as I am concerned , I think the young people can enjoy life more because of the characteristices of young people that is internatonl , mobilization and the ablity to communication .

To begin with , with the advent of Internet , the world we living in is becoming more smaller than before .
today 's young people can easily get in touch with the most popular cultures in the world .
they are more international than their parents hence they can enjoy the movies in Holywood from America , the most fashion clothes from Paris and the most exciting football plays from the Endland .
because of this , they enjoy the life more .

Furthermore , today ; s young people is mobilization .
By car , train and air , they can travell to where they want to go .
Just contradicting the low quality of transporation their parents having in the past time , we can responbsible to say that the young enjoy life more .
The young people can go sight-seeing and enjoy the magnificant cultures all over the world .

In addition , for the various ways that people can make a communication , the young peole gain more stronger ability to communicate with others and it makse them more friends .
During their study time they can meet lots of people who may be come from different places even countries .
those people all may help the young people or provide them many opportunities when they begin to work .
so the young people can enjoy life more .
but the old people may not enjoy so much friendship because of the limitation of ways of communication .

From what has been discussed aboved , we can safety draw a conclusion that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
