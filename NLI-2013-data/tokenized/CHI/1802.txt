I do n't agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than loder people do . ''
.
As a senior citizen , old people have already finished their duties to their families and the socioal , so they do n't have many things to involotion them .
They can spend much time to travelling and to see their old friends who are also senior citizens , sometimes they can even walk for a whole day to enjoy the sunline and flesh air .
At home old people are always no.1 .

Some people say that old people have not much time to enjoy themselves , but I do n't think so , as they have no work to do , they seem to have more time to enjoy lives , on the other hand , how many young people really have time to realx themselves , as in the school they have countless homework to do , and countless words to hear from teachers and parents .
To the young workers , you can never realx yourself as you must work hard as you have to affect your family and your parents .

Many people say that old people ca n't catch up with the society , something like music and games which is so atracted to us .
But what will I say is that as them are n't interested in these things they miss nothing .
They have many things to every day as these things are what they think are interesting .
And as a old people who have enough experiences they always do many things in a more quickly and easier than the young people .
And old people always have enough things to think as we need to spend a lives to get .
