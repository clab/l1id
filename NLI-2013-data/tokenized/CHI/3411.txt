It is sometimes difficult to discuss if young people do not spend too much to help their communities .
Some people may agree that young peolpe do n't help others , while oyhers tend to state that young people help each others the their communities all the time .
However , I have also come to my own opinion that young people do not spend much time on helping their communities .

First , as techonolgies improve , too many recreations could deflect the concentration of young kids .
For instance , the video games and internet , created in late 1980's , provide much more visual pleasure that before .
So more and moer young people would like to spend all their to play games or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their communities .
Unlike young kid before , who did have more time to interact with other members in their communities , young people nowadays have less topics of communities , except games , to discuss .
So they do n't share their lives with their communities , no mention to help their communities .

Second , in my opinion , fewer and fewer young people nowadays do realize the meaning of helping others .
It is a pitty that even in the school , teachers rarely instruct the real virtues of human .
All the teachers ask young kids to do is that they should forcus on themslves , not others .
They just acquire knowlege form textbooks , but they do n't learn how to deal with other people , respect other peoplem , and even help other people .
As a result , they do not give any support to their communities , because they do n't how to do and what to do .

Thay is not to say , of course , that other points of views are without merit .
I am sure that there are do some young kids serving others .
However , on the basis of the above mentioned , I think the reasons I have provided in favor of my position are build on a solid foundation .
