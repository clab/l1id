Based on my current observation and personal experiece , I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First of all , young people nowadays are too occupied by class work .
Take myself for example , when I was young school did not demand so much class work as they do today .
My younger brother who goes to college now spend almost all of his weekend working on class projectes .
He barely has anytime to do anything that he is interested in .
While in the past , my college was not so demanding and I had much more free time to engage in cummunity activities .

Secondly , due to the advent of the internet and mobile phone , young people nowadays have very few connections with the communities .
Young people nowadays spend most of their time in their rooms surfing the internet or talking to their friends through the mobile phone .
They seldom go out and meet people in the communities , not to mention offering any help to the communities .
Recently , I had a chance to visit a children hospital that I used to volunteered when I was in college .
I was surprized by the few number of college students now volunteering there .

Finally , I find an obvious trend from recent newspapers and magzines ; the number of hosipital and non-profit organizaion lacking volunteer is increasing .
Especially , those activities that were traditionally carried out by young people .
For example , the Taiwanese government started a program some years ago to recruit young people to offer volunteer work overseas .
Recently , I read an article on the newspaper saying that now the government is having difficulties getting enough young people to help the communities .

Based on the three specific experiences and observation I decribed above , I agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not help their communities enough .
