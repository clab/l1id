For me , I would agree to join a group that led by a tour guide ; however , to travel by ourselves in an unknown plave in very dangerous and will spend lots of money .

Let 's imagine a condition .
If we travel to an unknown place with only a map and confused by it , will we have a lot of fun in that place ?
I think everyone 's answer is no .
We can not just visit an unknown place on foot ; we should drive a car .
If we miss the direction , we have to keep driving and spend lots of money for the oil .
Without the help of the tour guide , we might live in an expensive hotel .
If there is something we do not understand about the landscapes , there is no one we can ask , and it is not easy to ask a stranger .
Once we meet the dangers such as medical care , it will be very hard to seek the volunteers who can help us .

If there is a tour guide , we can visit the place , which in the place we do not even know before , with happy heart and good consulors .
We do not need to bring a map becuase the tour guide is our map .
We do not need to walk or drive the car and spend the oil money ; we will have a comfortable bus and pay only a small amout of money for it .
We will not have any questions about the landscapes becuase the tour guide will be a teacher .
If we have dangers , the tour guide will find a way as soon as possible to solve it .

In conclusion , even though travel just by ourselves can make us have more freedom and time , but we will also bring anything that is uncertain with us , such as car accidents and miss the way to go .
We all sure want the happiness and peace with us when we are traveling , but without a good helper , everything will happen easily .
If there is a good helper when we are traveling , we do not need to worry much about everything becuase the tour guide can led us to the happiness and peace .
Although we have to pay the money to the tour guide , but the most important is the safety and a nice spirit in a trip .
