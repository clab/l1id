I agree with the sentence on the paper .
The sucessful people do it by that behaviors or perspectives for reasons including improve tability , satisfy theor ambitions , and sharpen thier mind , not only the sucessful people prefer to do it , but also the peolle who persiut the sucess .

Although there are dozens of sucessful politicions , the leaders of the corporations , I do n't know whether they have the characterist or not , whearas , I can make sure that they can immagine the directions and map of the future , prior to doing so , they have to try to the things which is they are not experienced in an affort to produce their new ideas , and make an challege to find their limits in their life .

I take artists whose name that I have forgotted in the modern world for example , many of them like to go abroad to experince the different culture , creature in the foreign life , and study the foreign university to study and broden their mind , when they do that , they will sharpen their creation to form their sculptures , works , paintigs , and theor designs .

And another instence is me , aithough I am not the sucessful man that people have thought for a long time , I think if i accomplish my assighment which is many step in my goal , i do the sucessful job .
i always practice my chinese compositin and poet by ra
