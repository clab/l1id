Cars play very important role in our lives .
Although they cause a lot of problems , for examples , traffic problems and pollution , they still one of the most convenient tool for us .
I cannot imagine if we dont have cars in our lives , what our lives will be .
In twenty years , we may find solution to deal with the problems , wich are caused by cars .
However , it does n't means cars will be fewer in use than there are today .

First , as the main economy support , cars are very important to many countries , not only the developed countries , but also the developing countries .
Now , the consumption of cars is increasing in many developing country .
For example , china , according to a report for chinese consumption this year , cars become the chief production for chinese to spend money on .
More and more companies to sell their cars in China than before .
China has a large number of populations in the world .
As a result , there will be more cars in use in the future .

On the other hand , although we can use other trasportations , such as subways , electronic buses , even bikes , which are common in china , we can not ignore the great use of cars .
Cars are no doutly the most convenient tools for us .
We can drive car anytime to anywhere .
Unlike subways , which has limit of places , we can reach where we want to directly and without time restrict .

It is true that cars cause many problems , one of the biggest problems is pollutions .
I think with the improvement of science techonology , cars will become more available than today .
In fact , a lot of country and companies devote large amount of money to reseach new cars wich will reduce pollution effectively .

In sum , cars will not be few , but more in use in the future .
Because they are the primary economy support and most convenient and necessary tools for people 's lives .
