Many people have asserted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Although this topic can be reject from some skin-deep reasons , it is a topic which is hard to answer due to its complexity .
In my opinion , I strongly agree this statement .
There are several resons .

First of all , most of young people spent their time on studying , playing and excerising .
Moreover , those activities have obivious effect on their future life .
That 's why most of teenagers and men do n't want to spent time to helping their communities .
They think they ca n't get any profit from this action .
In my hometown , students only help their neighborhood when their schools ask them to do that .

Second , some adults think that , it is very dangerous for kids to clean or to help the community .
We can read and see many bad news like murder or violent behavior happend in our society every day .
According to this reason , we seldom see our teenagers and kids help their neighborhood .
There is a report says that , only three percent of the kids in my country have done such of work .

Third , there are many workers help us to clean our communities .
That is common scene in my hometown because our government has already hired them to do that from a long time ago .
So , young people do n't have to do heavy work , and they may be lack of motion to do so .
By the way , young people also lack of efficiency on doing such of work like cleaning or protecing their community because they wo n't get any payment from their hardwork .

Of course , some people who disagree with my opinions also have their own reasons .
However , I 'm very confident that my reasons are more important and indeed .
