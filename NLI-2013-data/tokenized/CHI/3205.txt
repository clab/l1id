As a high school student , I am often pretty upset and even a little irritated of the generally misconception of the young generation has become more selfish if compared with the previous generation .
That is , frenquently heard from adults that young people have no contribution to others and even the communities they belong to .

That is completely wrong !
Take my school for instance , we do care about our communities and in fact spend plenty of time to do all kinds of voluntary works in out communities .
Almost every weekend , students from different grades gather together in front of our school at seven in the morning .
You may be quite curious what we are going to do ?
It 's saturday !
Students then be divided into several groups by teachers and after that , it 's time for us start our mission .
Actually , we are assigned different jobs to do every weekend ; sometimes we clean the streets which we do most frequently ; sometimes we visit some charities in the community to do voluntary jobs for them ; sometimes we clean the park , located next to our school ; sometimes we hold band performances as entertainment for people in the community who have no idea what to do on the weekends .
Sounds interesting and tempting ?
Absolutely .

Stuents at my school are encouraged to join these activities because our teschers stress that school is n't the only place for learning .
To tell the truth , this is excatly what I think and the most important reason encouraging me to give up my holidays .
I still remember clearly once we were to visit kids with similar ages with us but suffer from mental illness or other disabilities .
I was quite afraid because I thought they might be scary in both appearances and behaviors .
But what I had seen was their most sincere smiles and enthusiaism to make friends with each us .
From then , I started to visit them frenquently with some books and clothes as gifts for them .
I come to realize there is never a border between people , once I 've decide to open my mind to accept and respect .

These activities held by schools to encourage students to get involved in their communitues are n't unheard form other shcools and other parts of my country .
Young people are n't careless about involving and helping others in thier communities but rather entusiaistic and willing to help , once we know how to step out our first step .
