Towards the statement that `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , I would say that I agree to this statement .
There are severals reasons to support my belief .

Firstly , specializing on only one specific subject would make a person becomes abstract .
Concentrating in training students one specific subject may have harmful effect in children 's development .

Though having deep knowledge in one specific subject would let people become expertise , the society only requires a small portion of such kinds of experts , where college professors are the examples .
Instead , having variety of academic knowledge provides people diverse potential job position to select .
For example , a person who studies history may only able to work in a museum .

Furthermore , multi-dimensional development should be encouraged instead of being expertise .
People having knowledge on diverse subjects would have a great difference from those only received specialized knowledge .
Having broad knowledge of different academic subjects would let a person make friends from various culture .
She could share her experience with her friends not only in physics or chemistry , but also from geography to sociology , which let her not to be isolated in a small area of interest .

Therefore , I would think that instead of having specialized in one subject , board knowlege in
