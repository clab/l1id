I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
As we all know , technology and science is developing quickly nowadays .
So there is a big market on producting and consuming on cars .
How could human beings can drop this golden opportunity to make money ?

Fisrt , if you live in a big city with a car available , you can easily get to the destination where you want to be .
You do n't need to get on crowded buses and waste a long time just for waiting buses ' coming .
For examples , in the late evening if you have something urgent and also we know that it is really hard to get a taxi or bus , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solved .

Second , now cars are invented in different styles and even you can choose what contents in it .
So they are access to your needs such as high-quality stero inside the car .
Then you can enjoy the music during your driving .
And more and more cars will be produced by car factories .
The price of cars must be dropped to the level that ordinary people can afford it .

Finally , new energies are being invented by scientists .
They will soon be used instead of petrol and gasoline .
That is to say that cars will scarcely pollute our environment .
So we do n't need to worry about those gases such as carbon dioxides and acid rain which destroy atmosphere and constructures of our city .

All in all , we can clearly see that how a car is convenient to our life .
My friends always proud of that their can drive a car and they are very addicted to the enjoyment of process in driving .
So we can infer that there will be more and more people who are willing to buy their own cars and that will promote our country 's develpment .
