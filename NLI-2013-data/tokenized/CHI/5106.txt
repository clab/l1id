I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better tahn they really are .
In the recent years people 's lifes have been greately improved , and pepole began to demend more things to their lifes .
Becasues there are more demends , or consumers , the market started to expend , and it caused more suppliers joined into the market .

Suppliers must compete with each other inorder to let consumers to buy their products , and one effcient way to compete with others is advertising .
Before buying anything from the suppliers , consumers would try to know more about the products through advertisements made by the suppliers , and this gives the suppliers a chance to show their products .

Bearly no one would buy a thing just by one look , so the advertisements need to be more detailed and more attractive .
Consumers would compare about the advertisements between different suppliers rather than the products themselves .
Suppliers clearly understand what consumers 's thoughts are , and they would try to add more things to the advertisements , what may make them more superior than the others .
The superior ones are always more attractive to the consumers , at least more people would pay more attentions to them .

Although the `` addtional '' things or functions added to the advertisement are usually not exist or in the real products or the real ones will not work as efficient as the one the in advertisement , but it would never be a problems for the supplier , because what they cared most is the amount of product been sold .
Consumers may not recoganize what is true about the products until they bought them , and somehow they have to accpt the truth although they expected a much better result .

In the recent years advertisements are no longer a way for consumers to get knowing about the productions from the suppliers , but more likely they became a way to just increase the selling amount by the sellers .
Things described better than the real ones in the advertisement are very common now , it is a misfortune for most of the consumers .
