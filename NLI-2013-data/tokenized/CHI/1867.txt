I partiall agree with the statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It indeed seems that the youth are more energetic and many new things around us are created by them , however the old people also enjoy their life in their own way , which may be no less than the youth do .

First , we have to admit that the youth , due to their age and physical strength , are more likely to take part in some fierce and competitive acitivities , such as football , disco dancing , bungee etc , Therefore , their life are full of thrills and challenges more probably .
For example , if you want to take part in the football game , you must be strong , firm , not afraid of your opponents no matter how strong they are .
Then you must strive not to let your goal pass into the opponents ' team , you also need to discover or create the best opportunity for shooting .
Therefore , this is a good experience of relaxing yourself and acquiring a sense of accomplishment .
Besides the activities that are suitable for the young people , it is no doubt that the young people are more sensitive to newly-emerging things and terms , because their knowledge structure is not set , so they dare and are willing to taste things that are new to them .
With the development of technology and society .
You can find many new terms such as cool , surfing the internet , iPod , 3x etc .
All of these are created and used by the youth for the first time .

However , these does n't mean the older people have nothing to do to enjoy their everyday life .
On the contrary the elderly people , because of their experience , is more wise in making important decision about what should give up and what should stick on .
For instance , many successful investment are accomplished by business who has rich experience .
So impetus at a time wo n't make them make wrong decisons will cost billions of money .

In summary , the youth and the elderly have their own characteristics in enjoying their life .
Maybe the previous like to try something new and exciting , the latter prefer a calm and rational way of enjoying life .
