I could not say that every young person dedicate themselves to helping their communities , but I do think that a large number of them are doing a large amount of voluntary work to help make a better community .

I have witnessed many participations in social service by young people around me .
When I was in high school in Hong Kong , the city where I live , almost everybody at school joined at least one volutary activity , be it elderly home visit or fund-raising carnival .
Some put a lot of effort into organizing these voluntary work , while others supported by generous donation or active participations .
We all enjoyed being involved in these activities , knowing that we are contributing to our communities .

I have personally contributed and experienced community work , too .
As members of the Hong Kong Red Cross Youth Units , my team mates and I have initiated a few service projects which served the objectives of charity organizations .
We designed a 3-day programme , which included a fun day for elderly and children , to convey messages such as social harmony and cross-generation communication .
All of us have dedicated ourselves into the preparation and launching of the projects .
It was time-consuming but we all believed that it was worth making a more joyful community .

Helping the communities is not only demonstrated by actual participation in voluntary work .
I think that the young people who are really making contribution are those who manage their time well between voluntary work and academic study .
We should always look at things in the long term .
Instead of complaining that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , maybe we should appreciate how they are trying to get the most of their study and contribute to the society later on .
That means that they are not wasting the resources that the society is giving them in their education .
They also prove that the ` investment ' in their education will generate returns when contribute what they learn back to the society .
Are n't they helping their communities , too ?

Many young people are actually aware of their positions in their communities and are giving a lot of time to help .
We should appreciate what they have done and encourage those who are doing less to contribute more .
Ultimately they will be the ones who benefit from a better community they themselves live in .
