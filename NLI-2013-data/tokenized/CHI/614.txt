I agree with the statement , partly .
Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is great , but focus on a specific subject is also very good .
I think it depends on your age and your position in the company .

When we are in the middle schools , it is better to have broad knowledge .
A teenager do n't know exactly what they want .
They may be eager to become a famous singer in the moring , and carzy about the idea of being a scientist in the midnight because of a sweet dream .
And everyone 's interest may change in the long run .
When I loved the computer games in my 14 years old , I wanted to be a game designer .
In every dream of mine , I studied computer science in a famous high school .
I attained the Blizzard Entertainmet Company ( The most famous company which presents pc-games ) .
I was the only focus in the E3 ( the greatest pc-games conference ) .
But now , I lost my interest in pc-games .
Being a doctor is more attrative to me .
If I put all my passion on computer and gave up my schoolwork , no doubt I was regrating for that .

But when we are in univercities , we should choose a subject to study .
Today , no one can handle all knowledge .
Everybody should know something deeply and corporate with others .
As old chinese saying goes : `` You know everything , you know nothing . ''
If you do n't have your specific subject , you will find no job .
Because everything you can do , there are many people who can do it better than you .

Not only your age , your position in the company also determines whether you should have broad knowledge or specific subject .
If you are the manager , you should know something about economics , administration , and the products you provide .
But if you are a staff , you should care about what exactly the company want you to do .

So we can get a conclusion : both board knowledge and specific subject is needed , just thinking about which is better for you .
