Throughout the whole elementary , middle and high school , I have learned both ideas and facts from the school .
I have come to realize that whenever I understand the ideas and concepts , I can do so well in the test .
However , it does n't mean that I agree on the statement .
Instead , in my opinion , facts certainly obtain more valuable life experiences for students from their ancestor .

In the chinese culture , we have a dialogue : `` reading million books can not be compared to walking million miles '' .
I think about this statement everytime when I am traveling in somewhere .
Some might think that this dialogue does n't apply to the statement .
However , what I mean with the dialogue is that , the ideas from the book is dead , but experience is something that has once live on world .
Although understanding the idea may help me to obtain a high math or science score , it is however , not much helpful instead of it .
This is my conclusion based upon my three years in United States .

I am living in the school domitary .
It is a house with eight girls living inside , supervised by a houseparent .
The first day of my second year in America , I arrived the house , and it was the beginning of hell .
My new houseparent , is , in most of the girls ' opinion , the worst human being we have met on earth .
It is not the matter of her weird English after more than twenty years in United States , it is not the matter that she cooks bad or enforces rule strictly .
As an adult and an counsellor , who should be well-feeded by different ideas and knowledges , she however has favorism on certain girls .
Out of no reason , she treated me meanly ever since the first day I got there .
For instance , she went into my room without knocking on my door , yelled at me for not doing the chrous , which in fact , in not my work .
Moreover , she absuptly refused my request for leaving my room so that I can get change .
In addition , she isolated the house into two groups , and talks behind the back of the group she does n't like .
I have learnt since then , that ideas and concepts does n't change a person personality , Just as my devil like houseparent , who has been a consellor in publich school , who knows thousand of theories .
Whenever I was trying to express my idea , she never understand , nor does she ever care about me .
I learned fact that talking concepts to her do not help anything .
According to my experience , the only way to live happily is to keep my mouth shut .
Hopefully , this is going to end in two mouthe , .
