There are certains considerations or factors which everyone takes into account the issue .
Different people have different opinion due to their respective experience .
On the one hand , some people assert that young people nowadays should volunteer help their communities .
On the other hand , others believe that young people do n't have to help their communities because they do n't have enough time so far .
In my opinion , I agree the fact that young people nowadays so not give enough time to helping their communities .
In the following discussions , I would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints .

First of all , most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars information , friendships , and so on .
It usually makes them do n't have enough time to help their communities .
In other words , they usually concern about themselves more than others .
For example , if you talk about that what happened to the famous star recently , they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes , and attractive in their appearances .
There are so many accractive things to worth them to pay attention to .

Second , most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do n't understand how their communities work .
They have few contact with their communities .
As a result , they do n't know get a whole understandings with their communites .
At the same time , most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually , even unfriendly .

Fianlly , most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships .
That is to say , in the repid development of society , there are full of pressures in our life , most of them focus on the incoming befenits which they earned as soon as possible .
They do n't want to give more .
Most young people want to be lead a luxirous life and pursue for the dreams what they really want to in the future .
They become more selfish .

To sum up , given the reasons above discussion , I agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Because they are educated more selfish , most of them concerned themselves more than others .
In addition , they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting .
Meanwhile , they do n't have enough opportunities to get in touch with their communities .
They lack the connections and interactions between families , schools and communities .
And that 's the reasons .
