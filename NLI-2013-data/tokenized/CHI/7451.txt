In people 's life , they need a guide who can lead them to the right way and the also need sorrounders ' help while they do everyting brand new .
Otherwise people might be lost their way or go to an incorrect direction .
Therefore , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When people tralvel in a group they can help each other and make the trip safely .
Led by a tour guide is also important because people will go to the right direction and they wo n't get lost .

While people chose how to travel , they will chose travel in a group .
So do i. Several years ago when i was in grade 6 , i wanted to have a trip and because of my parents are very busy so they can not take me to travel .
They did n't allow me to travel alone .
I was extremely disappointed and did n't eat for a whole day .
My parent 's felt awful .
Then , they came up with an idea which was took me to the travelling center , and the travelling center would have a group trip just for students .
So i joined the group and i had a wonderful trip .
I thing my parents took me to travel in a group because it was safe and these `` cute '' guys would help each other when they have difficulties .
All in all , travel in a group is safe and people can help each other .

Even though travel in a group is safe , people can still lost their ways because they do n't know where to go in a brand new place .
They may go to incorrect directions or stay at one place for a long time .
These well loss lots of time and time is our life .
And these may make people in trable and in danger .
Therefore , we need a tour guide to led the travelling group to go to the correct way and leave the `` trables '' alone so that it will be much more safe and save our time .

In conclusion , if people want to have a safety and fantastic trip , travel in a group led by a tour guide is very important because we do n't want hanppiness and trables beside us .
