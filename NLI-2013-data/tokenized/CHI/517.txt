There is a controversial issue about whether students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject .
Depending on their distinct backgrounds and experiences , different students hold different opinions .
In my point of view , I think a specific learning is better because it is more dominated in a person 's career .

The most impornt reason of choosing a specialized knowledge is that nowadays the knowledge in every subject is becoming more and more difficult .
On one side , as the sciense and technology develops , the knowledge of one specific subject becomes more complicated .
On the other side , a person 's energy is limits by the nature .
Thus , if a person insists on learn a broad range of subjuects , he will find that he is left behind the other persons more and more .
For example , one of my classmates , who liked to learn lots of different subjects , such as mathematics , biology and arts , got a bad GPA during his college career .
Therefore , we should not expect us to be a perfect person who knows everything .
A good example , Bill Gates , the richest man in the world , may lose the match to a pupil in playing ping-pong .
So becoming a person who is expert in one area is more reasonable .

Another important reason is that the current society need more and more specific-trained persons , such as IT enigeers , doctors , professional player and so on .
Today works can no more be classified to several types , they are elaborated to very specific jobs .
For example , the computer companies have been divided to sofeware companies such as Microsoft , hardware companies such as Intel .
Moreover , new types of companies are also appearing , such as internet companies , Goole .
These different jobs need more and more knowledge in specified area and a narrower knowledge range compared to the past .
Thus a specific-trained person is obviously more suitable than a widely-trained person .

To be fair , I must own up to the importance of the elementary knowledge in a wide range .
Everyone should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects in his/her junior and senior school to detemine what he/she is suitable for .
However , this broading learning is just preparing for the later deeper specialized learning which is longer and more important in one 's career .

To sum up , due to the reasons mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that students should specialize in one specific subject .
