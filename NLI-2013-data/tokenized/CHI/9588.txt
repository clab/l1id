I disagree with the statement .
Because i think that , do something we are known is more easlier to handle .
Successful people have done something that he good at , and this thing make him successful .

Use Disney for example .
every years , they will have new cartoons to show us .
Many people all over the world must watch them .
Becaus Disney is good at creative cartoons .
These cartoon make Disney famous , successful and wonderful .
Disney also has their own Disneyland .
It is a famous story that everyone knows .
However , if Disney try to do something they have n't done before , such as they going to have a fashion store to selling some high fashion clothes .
I think it may be not working .
Becaus they are not good at creative fashion things , they ca n't use the same ways to creative fashion from creative cartoon .
May be they can success at the end .
But i have no idea about the date they can do it .
Before they are success in the fashion ares , they must lose many time and money .
People can not know about why Disney want to creative fashion .
Because all people just know their cartoon is fantastic .
No one will belive that they can do it at the beganning .
People will have some brands of fashion to buy clothes .
Becaus these brands are good at fashion .
They will not try to creative cartoon .

So , I think wherever sucessful people or noraml people .
They just want to do their best thing of what they good at .
