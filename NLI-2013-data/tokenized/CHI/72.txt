In recent years , the education systems are diffrent .
Some people perfer the students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , however other perfer to have specialize in one specific subject .
For me , i would agree with first oppinion .
The reasons are as follows .

First and formost reason is that in this sociaty we need compehensive person .
Nowadays , the competition is very drastic , every body has ambition to be the first , if i just have specialize in one specific subject , i could not allow to have various job oppotunities , and also i will lose some good chance .
for example , if i specialize in history , i just can find some job rely on history , but there are not have many job in history , but if i study borad subjects i can afford many diffrent jobs , even it not intrested , but i can get job and money .
I can servive .

Second factor is that it can improve my organizetion skills .
for example , if i stduy broad knowledge of many academic sujects i will organize the time , and my work ethic .
Also it enlarge my view , also in diffrent calsses , i will meet diffrent people , it also can improve my communication skills and interpersonal skills .

Thid lies in fact is that it pave my way for furture .
If i have abroad knowledge of many academic subjects , i can have good job oppotunity and also if i meet diffrent people , i can easy to talk with them and easy to find intrest objects to talk , because i have large knowledge .
Also it improve my socal communication .

In brief , even specialize in one specific subject , you might save time and save money , but you will loss more .
According to what i have disscuss about , if you want to give them good impression and if you want to survive in this sociaty , you should have broad knowledge if many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject .
Weighing the pros and cons of these argumentation , i agree that it is better to habe broad knowledge of many academic subject .
