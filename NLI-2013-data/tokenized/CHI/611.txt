The situation of learnning simplely but deeply or widely is a thing depends on the time .
I 'm really not agree with only judging it by good or bad .
Human 's life is a long time , sometimes we should do something , but some other times maybe we need other things .

In one 's undergraduate time , it is fit to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Thus you have four or even three years to study in university , and also you are young .
You have the spirit to explore the unclear things and fill in your mind .
It will let you do well when you face to social , as you have more theory knowledge and special experience .
The enviroment of the university is good for learn more thing .
There has lots of excellent professor , and you can exchange your opinion with your classmates .
For example , if you are comparing to make a design which is about geogerophy , how will adverse your boss to use your design ?
But if you have a knowledge background about the geogerophy , you will do better .

After graduating from university , if you want to go on developing youself , you had better to specialize in one specific subject .
At that time , you have less time , and you must think about your life and how to offer your family .
The fact will tell you that you should do something more deeply , as your spirit is limited .
Another reason is no one can do lots of things in the same time .
If you want do the best , you should pay more attention on what you are doing .
Just like we ca n't choose both sleep and eat .

Broad knowledge is a wonderful thing , but we ca n't control all of them in fact .
Specialism sometimes looks like boring .
What you will do depends on youself .
