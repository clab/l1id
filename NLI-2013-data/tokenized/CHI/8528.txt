I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Students should understand the ideas and concepts , so they can know the answer .
And if the students dind n't do that , they will have no choice to do taht again .

Students understand ideas and concepts can develop their knowledge .
During they thinking for the reason , they can know how to answer it .
For example , the teacher let the students to do their homework , only write the reasn .
So a lots will copy theirclassmates ' homework .
That is unuseful .
But if theteacher to tell the students to write down how they answer those questions , so the students must do that by themselves , that will give the students a lot of hep .
Students can know that how to answer the questions .
For example , when the students understand the ideas and concepts , that means they also can know the way to answer those question .
That can give them a lot of help for their future .

The students always know the things from understand something , that can make them to know that thing clearly .
For example , it likes that people can learn things from doing that .
That can make them to know that more easier and clearly .
Let the students to understand the ideas and concepts are also can make them to know a lot of things about the life .
For example , to understand the ideas can make them know that it is life .
In their life , they must still find the way to answer all the qwuestion .
They must use the different ways to answer the different questions .
No body can help them expect themselves .

The students ca n't learn facts expect they understand the ideas and concepts .
If they did n't understand the ideas and concepts , they would n't learn the right facts , they will not understand the facts , so when that time , they will have the wrong thinging for the facts .

So that is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts .
They can study how to have their life and can know more knowledges from that .
