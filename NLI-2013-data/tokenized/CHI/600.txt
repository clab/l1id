Actually , it is not my belief that it is better for an educated person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
In today 's changing society , it is far from enough to be just an `` expert '' .

When we watch television or read newspaper , we think that to have an expert talking about a subject is reasonable or even that only the expert has the authority to talk about the subject in public .
Based on this psychological effect , we tend to support the idea that the society should produce more `` experts '' , so that people will get more reliable information from the media and their lives .
However , when it comes to education , it will be a bad idea for the students nowadays .
For example , I 've always wanted to be an simultaneous interpreter .
But being an interpreter requires a lot more than the knowledge about translating .
He has to know `` something about everything , and everything about something '' .
If he has to go to a conference which is dicussing the oil crisis .
He has to know the basic information about oil , all kinds of oil in fact .
Therefore , a successful professional should n't be limited in the arena of his specialized subject .
Otherwise , his success would n't last very long .
For example , if you are an employee working for an insurance company .
The basic rule for you to success is that you know how to sell .
That is a skill that involves with a lot of other subjects .
You 'd better know how the hospital works , so that you can sell your insurance to its patiences .
Then you need to know what kind of patients can make protential customers and what kind of patients can not ( like those who have developed uncurable disease ) .
So , after years of studing in college , if you know nothing other than what insurance is , you are definitely doomed .

So , in my opinion , being an `` expert '' is not a bad thing , but what we really need in today 's challenging world are people who have their specialization and also the broad knowledge about the nature and the society .
