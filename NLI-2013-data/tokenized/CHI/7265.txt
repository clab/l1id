In the oversea traveling , people can take a choice of being guided by tours in a group or go sightseeing individually .
In my opinion , I think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
there are more funs to travel in agroup , and tour guide guide the whole team in a suitable way by the experience leadership .

First , tour guide have rich experience to plan the whole trip and guide the group in an apporiate ways .
Some tour guide can custom the trip that is most suitable for all the menbers under lots of constrinst such as limited time and money .

Second , a group of people can always be a helper or supporter for an other .
We can take care others and it is more secure for all the members when go outside our hometown .
Whether there is some accident in the travel , members can take care your belongs and help you to call your family if it is neccesary .

Thirdly , it is always true that members are more enjoyable when share and experience the same happinesss in the travel .
The whole environment is enhaced greatly .
Along the trip , member can reviews and shows some their intestests and experiences .
From the sharing , i am sure you will understand others happiness from their talking .

Lastly , members understand others deeper through the making of consenus in the trip such as what kind of living place and what is target of the trip .
Learn how to respect others ' opinions and find a critical balance between members ' agreements .
There maybe lots of disagreements here , sometime it is differicult make a balance or even conficts between the dicussions .
However , i believe the situation can be improved by first understanding members ' interest before the discussion and respect others ' concert .

In conclude , it is good to tarvel in a group with tour guide .
