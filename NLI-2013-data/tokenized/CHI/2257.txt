Teenagers have always been the hope and the backbone of our society .
Just like the relationship between teachers and students , teenagers bares the burden of achieving greater success than their parents .
But does this mean that the older generation 's lives are easier and happier than young people ?
No , I neither agree or disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First , we will talk about young people .
Nowadays , young people are the representation of our fast-changing society .
To most of them , life is a tideous fact which they cannot escape .
Faced with large amounts of academic studies in school , family pressure such as not fulfilling their demans to achieve good marks at school , and also family violence and the possibiliy of loosing a father or mother from a early divorce .
Young people today are also threatened with the corruption of our society .
Our media influences our young minds with movies , music , news and advertisements .
And what do young people learn from them ?
Violence , sex , dishonest , and many more unvirtous things .
A great example would be the increasing number of young gang members in our sociey .
Many of them were born and raised just like any other children , but the moment they turn on the 50 Cent rap songs , they are addicted .
Addicted not only by the beat of the music , but also corrupted by its contents .
Many of them began to immitate certain celebraties they adore without realizing whether the things they learn from these so-called `` artists '' are teaching them .
Some of them might even start walking the road towards crime .
So can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
I do n't think so .

On the other hand , the older generation face new problems too .
Today , we live in a world with little or no morale contiousness .
In countires such as China , the old Confucianism which binded the traditional way of life is disappearing .
Children do not respect the elders no more , they can argue with rudeness , they can have sex before they get married , they can smoke in school , they can dress themselves like whores and criminals .
Although our governments have fundings for the old people when they retire , but that 's not what old people really want .
Most old people have experienced wealth , fame and love , they do not need elegant houses and expensive cars .
They just need a good physical and mental health .
And despite the little amount of money for any old person to live other than the medical fees , what they need is love , love and caring from their kids .
Statistics have shown that a lot of old people die of lonelyness and frustration other than physical illnesses .
All that said , do older people live better lives than young people ?
I think neither .

Finally , I conclude that neither young or old people have enjoy life more .
The young troubled with pressures within themselves , they are faced with social and family pressures .
The old are left alone and isolated from the rest of the society as if they are useless .
To improve the situation , I think the only solution is instead of wealth and fame , people should pay more attention to morale principles .
