In the old days the communities almost equal to the whole world people are living in .
Therefore , there are strong connections between people and their communities .
However , nowadays , things have changed a lot .
As a global village , people can communicate with others who are far away .
The connections with communities seems not as important as before .
That makes the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

In modern world , there are so many things happen at the same time , and people usually only concern with those things have strict relationship with themselves .
For example , in the communities , we often see that it is always the older people who participate in the work .
Why ?
It is because compared to the community work , the young people have many other things are more important to them to accomplish , such as studying and making money .
It seems that all their time are occupied by these things already .

In the long run , the whole society seems to adapt this phenomena .
Also , gradually it has build up a wrong concept that because there are other things more important than community work , young people do not have to be responsible to their communities .
They not only do nothing to help the communities , but also sometimes wastes the resourses provide in the communities .
In other words , because of the wrong value of the society , instead of doing something good for the communities , the young people do someting harm to the communities .

Therefore , I think it is important to change this misthinking .
Parents should take their children to help their communities togather .
When they are used to doing this , they would not use `` no time '' to be an excuse for not take part in the work .
Now young people states that they have do time are not true , it is just simply because they do not want to .
If you are willing to help the community , you can always find time to do that .
