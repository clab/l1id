This is quite an interesting topic to discuss since I really enjoy travelling .
Concerning about this particular topic , I would like to say first is that different people would have different choices to make and really have fun through it , so I may not judge whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or not is a better way or not .
But to state my own experience , I would prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

For there was one time , my family decided to go to Thailand for summer holiday , we joined a group which are people from different areas of the country , we were led by a tour guide and to tell you what , that was the most fantastic travelling experience I have ever had before , the first advantage comes with guiding by the tour guide is that you do n't have to worry about the language problem , I mean , it may be fine while you are in your own country travelling , but out to another country which people speak a different language ?
Ahha , then you need a tour guide who can speak bilingual , you will taste the good part of it when purchasing some local souveniors , you want to buggle for a better price and find out that you could not speak even a single word .

Speaking about the second advantage that a tour guide provide , I should say first that my personality is that I sometimes do n't wish to concern a lot of things when it comes to travelling , I simply want to go and see the local customs , eat the local food and wander on the local streets and enjoy myself .
Resteraunt reservation , hotel renting , car renting , contacting with the spot 's manager such kind of staff , I just think in personal are what a tour guide 's major duty , If he can handle these perfectly , then he is a good guide .

Last , I think this reason is obvious and undoubtedly because a tour guide knows better than any of we travellers who travel there for the first time , he could show you where to eat the famous local sea food , he could tell you : `` Hey , you really should take a picture here for it was just the place some famous guy ate his breakfast .
