I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In our life the advertisements are almost everywhere , you can see them on newspaper , tv , wall , car and subway .
When you see the products on them , The products look so nice .
Everyone want to buy them , but when you got them , they did not seem better than advertisements .

The frist reason that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For example some advertisements on TV , they look so nice , so people will to buy these products , when they got the products , but it is not so good .
Thus some people will make more money .

The second reason that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , most advertisements are made by a lot people .
They know how to make products better than they are really .
So people like to buy them .

The third resaon that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , some products do not really good , if they do not make the advertusements better they will sale a few .
So people spend more money on the advertusements so they can sale more products , they will make more money than before .

Successfully when we know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
we can buy some products that we really need .
Do not buy those products seem better on the advertisements .

So I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
