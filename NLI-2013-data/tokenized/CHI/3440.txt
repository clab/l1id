Do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
Maybe some people nowadays do not realize the importance of communities , however , I think people cannot survive when isolate themselves from the crowd , because poeple need helps from other people .
So in my opinion , I totally agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because they do n't understand helping other people is vital in the society .
And here is my supporting reasons as follow .

Firstly , I think it is an excuse that young people do n't have enough time to help , because they spend too much time not only in studying but also in playing , and they do n't pay attention to the environment they llive in .
They should discover that here are many helps from communities like there are always some people who give help to clean up the trash .

The second point I want to express is perhaps there are some young people do know that helping their communities is necessary , however they just do n't have time to give .
Then , I think they should know how to schedule their time , and to use their time well .

To sum up , in my personal opinion , I think all people , including old and young people , should give enough time to helping their communities , because people always give help to each other .
I hope young people can understand that point of view , and contribute their time to their communities , and then make their communities much better .
