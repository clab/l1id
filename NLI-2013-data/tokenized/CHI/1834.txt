It is obvious that there is no absolute agreement on the issue if people in lower age enjoy life more than the older ones do .
Same person would even have different opinions as time flies .
So far as I concern , I do believe that there is more joy in the life of the youth than the old .

First and foremost , young people are in the prosess of growing , never will there not be something new for them .
It is really interesting to find something that is fresh to you .
Young people get more experience and knowlege about new things they encouter , and make there way to mature .

Secondly , young people tend to take more risk in life while the older ones are more conservative .
The more risk you take , the more fun you will find in life .
A life full of challenges may not result in pressure but encourage the inspiration and inovation of the young .
it is very common for young people to change their job and inhabitats often , they may move to the places where they think facinate at a time .
The changes in life will always take in fresh thoughts and feelings that to make life more exciting .

Last but not least , young people are phisically stronger than the older ones .
As is well known , most sports are paticipated by people in lower age with more require on strength , stableness and alligibility .
Most of the sports stars gain there reputations in there early age , as well as the successful people in other fields .
Young people can do everything as ever good in their whole life .
It feels ravishing when you get the feeling of having fully control of something you are good at .

In conclusion , young people enjoys life much more than the older ones in many aspects .
They are dynamic , lively and promising .
Never can we deny the truth that years in youth is the best time in life for everyone .
