I agree with it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts because if they understand the ideas and concepts , they may know the fact by their thinking , they may know the reason why of some other facts by their thinking , and they will make their own ideas .
First , i think if you really understand the idea , you may get the facts , because lots of things happen with their own relationship .
For example , if their is a new type of the computer shows up , and the qunlity of the computer is so good , you may know that people will buy that computer , because people want to get the better computer .
Secoundly , if you know some of the ideas , you may know why some of the things have that facts , same example as last one , if the computer is really good , but people still do n't want to buy it , what 's the reason , you may think about other staff other than qunlity , like price , maybe the price of this computer is too high , by knowing the idea , you can think of why other facts had happened .
Last point , you may make your own ideas by understand different ideas .
For example , you know the better qunlity and the cheaper price both can make people buying the computer , but you can n't get them both , so you may want to find the banlence of them to let people buy the computer .
That 's the most important of understanding a idea , make your own ideas .
In coonclusion , I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because knowing ideas can give them the way to find the facts and know why some facts happened , and help them make their own ideas .
