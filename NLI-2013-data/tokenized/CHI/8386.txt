The issue in hand is about the ideas and concept understaing or facts learing .
This issue is improtant because it can diectly affect the result of what the student learns .
I believe that the understandinf of the ideas and concepts is the better opinion since it can make it easlier for students to learn .

The first reason that I choose understanding of the ideas nad concepts because it is the easiler way of memory .
Unike remebering the facts , the uderstanding of the ideas and concepts is a lot easlier to transfer into long term memory .
Thus , it is able for student to remeber much longer .
Base on the easlier way of memory , I believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion than the other .

The stable foundation of the studies is the second reason that i choosse the understanding of ideas and concepts .
A deep understanding of the idea and concepts is similar to a building which has a stable foundation .
Only and only if the foundation of the building is strong enough , it is able to build up higher and higher .
Since the stable foundation of the studies , the understanding of ideas and concpets is better choice .

Finally , the abilities of flexible use make me choose the understanding of the ideas and concepts rather than the other .
The remebering the facts is just a remembering , it will not allow to create something new .
However , unlike the remembering facts , a deep understanding of ideas and concepts not only allows the students to create something new , but also provide the abilities to use it in any area .
Thus , I belieive that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion .

In conclusion , I believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion rather than the other .
It is because of the easlier way of memory , the stable foundation of the studies and the abilities of flexible use .
