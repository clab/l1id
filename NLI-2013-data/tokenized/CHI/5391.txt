In my opinion , there 's actually no certain answer to this question .
It depends on different situations .
In different cases , the qeustion has its different answers .
We can not deny that some of advertisements do n't make products seem better they really are .
However , most of advertisements make product seem better than they really are .

Some companies do n't make the advertisements of their products seem better than they really are because they know how important for their customers to believe them .
If the make a very good advertisement of a product , people might buy this product .
However , the product is actually bad .
People would find that the product is not as good as it is in the advertisement they saw after the use it .
It will make the customers feel disappointed and not trust that company anymore , so the company will lose a lot of customers .
That 's reason why some companies keep making `` true '' advertisements .
They want to have more returning customers .

Those false advertisements are usually made by some small companies which do not care if they will have returning customers or not .
Once these kind of advertisements are showen on TVs or newspapers , there will be a lot of people to buy this product .
Atfer they use it , they will realize that they were cheated by the company and wo n't buy its products anymore , Some of those small companies usually do n't spent much money and time to produce those products , so that they will get more benifits from these products after the mass of saling .
They do n't need returning customers because they already gain enough profits from the first time sale .
However , it is also the only time for them to sale thier prod
