I did not aree with the deal that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide .
The reason why I think so goes as fallow .

Although it is more safety to jion a group to travel , especially in a strange foreign country , it will limited one 's action .
Because in a group one have to obtain the group rules , an individual ca n't stay in the place that really attract him , it will be less free for sightsee .

Second , traveling not along with group will get more impressive experience because all the information must be accquired by efforts .
And it makes the experience more worthy .
A guide may provide only brief knowledge about the spots throught his time limited intrduction .
Searching the story about the exotic atmosphere is more attrative for me .

Third , in group travelling we may get new friends in the period , and getting new friends is interesting but may influence the quality of travllingbut because we might meet the people who has bad habavior that makes me unconfortable .
If I travel on myself I can choose the accompany whom i am alredy familar with .

Group travel is interesting , howerer learning to solve the cultrual gap problem by myseft is also intereting .
