I agree with the condition , young people do enjoy life more than older people .
Not only because older people had lived longer , but also young people are more active .
Yet , young people like to try anything new , they are more willing to accept the changes of the world .

Because older people have lived longer , so they had try anything new during their `` younger life . ''
As they grow older , they are more mature , they know what is the most important in their life .
For example , a young man of age 18 will go to night club more often than a man who is 23 , the reason is because that the man knows there is just a place for rest and maye he needs to work on the next day .
On the other hand , the young man will think the night club is very fansy and fun , because there is lots hot girl or any other reason that attract his attention .
In this case young man knows how to release himself in a night club , but the man did not get rest totally in the club .

Young people are usually more active than the older people , because they have more energy , yet , they are easily to take attention on new things than the older people .
For examplel , lets say a 18 young man and a 25 man , they both like to read novels , but maybe the man would not to go to the store to rent it , and just have fun sitting there to read , or go online , do some novel search .
Oppositie , the young man may go to the store and sit there 4 hours just watching novels and enjoy in it .
Older people can not do anything they want freely , because they need to think more and they have to have the motivate to do it .

No matter what the change is , older people do not like it and they can not survive from it , but young people , even if they do not like the change , they can still survive from it .
For example , grandmother did not think that her granddaughter can go to school and married at age of 16 or 17 .
Different from the mother , she would let her daughter go to school , and to be educated , not marrying until the age of 28 , so then the grandmother would always complain to the mother that she should not let her daughter to go to school .

All in all , older people can not enjoy their life , not because they had lived what the young is living but because they are not as active as the young do .
Moreover , older people do not like anything new or to be changed , they are stuck in their own world .
Which is different from the young people , who is enjoy their life , play around , and try any new things .
