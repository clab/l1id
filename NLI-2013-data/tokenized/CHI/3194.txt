Although I 'm a young person myself , I have to agree with the statement with a heavy heart .

The lack of participation in community service among young people results mainly from lack of time .
I am currently a student in a competitive high school , and the demand of schoolwork allows me very little free time .
School begins at 7:40 in the morning and ends at 5:10 in the afternoon .
Since I live very far from the school I attend , I have to commute by train for three hours each day .
When I reach home , it 's almost 7:00 pm .
The sun has set , the sky has darkened , the community is almost asleep , and I have tons of homework to do .
There is neither time nor opportunity for me to help out in my community , regardless of how much I want to serve and contribute .

Most high school students in the United States have finished hundreds of hours of community service before they graduate from high school .
Colleges in the U.S. often consider the hours spent on community service when evaluating an applicant , emphasizing the importance of a student 's willingness to serve his or her community .
Colleges in Taiwan , however , put very little emphasis on community service when viewing applications .
Instead , test scores and academic accomplishments are given major consideration .
Students devote their time and energy to activities that colleges find more important and neglect those that are thought trivial , resulting in a lack of dedication to community service .

Some high schools in Taiwan require their students to finish a certain amount of community service hours each year .
The minimum my high school sets for us is 8 hours each semester .
Students use the little free time they have during summer and winter vacations to finish the required hours of community service , doing simple jobs such as sweeping up fallen leaves , volunteering at the local library or tidying up the lobby .
Students have no time to participate in more meaningful and long-term communty services , such as helping out each day at the local day care center , orginizing a group to reinforce the recycling habits of residents , or tutoring for free at a public middle school .

From my observations and personal experiences , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is a regrettable situation , but it is a situation that canbe improved if students are given more free time and a stronger sense of community .
That way , students will be able to participate more in community service and receive a wonderful experience by spending time helping others and building a better community .
