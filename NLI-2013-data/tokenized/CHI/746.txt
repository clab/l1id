Somebody thinks that learn something besides his or her specific subject is kind of wasting time and energy .
However , if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it will allow a better understanding of your specialty .
A broad knowledge can also help you if you unfortunately meet with accidents .
Furthermore , it gives you more topics to talk with friends .

With a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you can do better in your specialty .
I believe everybody knows Sherock Holmes , a famous dectective .
What made him the greatest dectective in the world ever ?
A broad knowledge .
Holmes is an expert in violin .
He has also achieved great success in chemistry .
What 's more , he has several books published on the how to raise bees .
It is the large amount of knowledge in all the subjects that made him a distinguished dectective .
I remembered in the case that several people died after they have gone to swim in a small lake , Holmes used his biology knowledge to solve it .
It turned out that there was a rather rare poisonous jellyfish in that lake .
If he had put all the efforts on his specific subject , maybe he would not be able to solve it .

When meeting with accidents , a specific knowledge may not offer much help .
Let us assume that poor David met with a leg fracture .
If he specializes in Chemistry and nothing else , he might sit there , crying .
However , if David has some knowledge besides Chemistry , he might know to place some ice on the injured leg .

What 's more , a broad knowlege gives you many topics among your friends .
Almost no one likes to hear a professional talk on the development on brass .
However , nearly everyone fancies a talk on the history of opera .

More topics among friends , do better in your specialty , and know how to do if met with a accident , a broad knowledge of many subjects is definitely better than merely specialize in one subject .
