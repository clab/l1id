The idea of advertisements is to help the company to sell more products .
While competing with other companies , companies tend to make their products look better in their advertisements .
I agree the fact that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are , but I do n't disagree with the way companies do it .

The same as a movie preview , the director always want to show the most exciting part of the movie .
Companies tend to skip the inconviency and disadventige of their product .
Instead , they always show the best of their products .
Sometimes , the companies will use special editing and filming skills to make their product look even better .
For example , when the new I-Pod nano first came out in the comercial , people were amazed by its pretty disign and how small it was .
However , buyers soon realized that the I-pod nano was very easy to be scrached .
Moreover , the I-Pod nano has a very small menmory compare to other I-Pods .
The funny thing is that I bought a I-Pod nano right after i saw the comertial .
Of course , the nano was not as exciting as the ones in comertial , but it was not much worse .

However , I was really angry when i saw the first scrach mark on my I-Pod nano .
In now days , since people are living in a material word , there are many products are meant to make our life better , happier , but we do n't neccesarry need them in our dayly life such as a I-Pod , cable TV , computer , fancy clothing , and more .
Because of these products are not neccesarry for our life , companies have to make people want to buy them and do not expect a stable market without having any advertisement .
Of course , since advertisements are the only way people will know these products , companies try to make them look as good as possible .
Therefore , most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
