I agree with the saying that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to focus only on his/her specific subject .
Because doing so have a lot of advantages , not only in academic researchment .
But it 's also important for one to make real academic achievement .

Firstly , our science system have been and is developping rapidly nowadays , making the relationships and interacting between different subjects more and more .
So you really cannot just focus on one simple subject , because the broader you view , the more it helps to understanding what you are specific for .
As for me , though my major is computer networking , I also read a lot about other academic subjects such as biology and physics , even social arts .
Because I found when communicating , the behavior of people in society and the computers in a network is much the same , so we can use the same method to look deep into it and see how it organized and cooperated , and we can learn much about both of it .

Secondly , a broader knowledge make one person more sensitive .
This kind of scientific sensitive is extreamly important when making scientific inventions .
It 's because person can find the similarity between two things and make some really brillant solutions or ideas , Which is impossible if people just know the little thing of his major field .
In science history , a lot of invetions and discoveries came from a cross thinking of two distinct subject of science .

Of course , people should first know well about what he/she is specific .
But too much specialization just limit the person 's eyesight and make he/she blind .
So the idea that people should broad their knowledge is right .
At least it works for me .
