There is no denying that travelling in group led by a tour guide has become controversal , not only for the professonals but for the public as a whole .
Some people prefer the travelling that is in group and is led by a guide , and would like to put an end to it , while others do not think this is the best way .
As far as I am concerned , I contends that the travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
The reasons supporting my assertion will be shown bleow .

First of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is funnier .
Both common sense and our experience have informed us that if many people stay together , they will be happier and can make more funs .
For example , when we travel in a group , we can share our funny stories , chat with one anothe , and even play some interesting games .
All these activities help us to spend the boring time on the bus or the train .
And also , the guide can tell us some interesting local customs which enjoy us .

In addition , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer .
It is well known that the thieves usually attact the people alone , which situation is eaier for them .
While if the tourists are in group , we can look after one another , and also can take care of the belongs when some people go to the washroom .
And also , there are some dangers in some resorts , which the guide knows well .
In this situation , the guide will remind us to being careful .

Moreover , travelling in a group led by a tour guide makes us know more about the local culture .
We know that the gudie is professional and gets good training about the resorts that we visit .
At each resort , the guide will explain the history of it , and even gives some information we can not get from the guide book .
Thus the explaination made by the guide make our tourist more efficiently .

Notwithstanding the fact that travelling in a group led by a guide is noisier , this demerit can be compesiated by the many merits associated with the group travelling .

Beyond the doubt , when the facts are examined , its advantages and disadvantages weighed , and biased opinions casted away , it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that to travel in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel .
Given the practical realities of the modern society , in fact , not only I prefer the safety , fun , and knowledge brought about by the group travelling , but also I hope that the group members can be quiet some time when some people are tired .
