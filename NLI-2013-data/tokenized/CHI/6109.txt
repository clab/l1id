There is a controversial issue about whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Depend on personal experience , personality type and viewpoints of the globe , we may find that some people may hold the opinion that there are more cars in twenty years than in today , on the other hand , some people may choose there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than in today .

The choice , nevertheless , is not easy to make .
However , from my point of view , I would like to believe the later one is more reasonable .
For there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now , my arguments are listed as follows .

A essential reson can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from the cars in big cities pollute the environment around us seriously .
According to a recent survey accounced by the A dminister of Health of China , the cars gas pollution accounts 38.7 % in the total pollution which harm our environment .
This strongly demonstrates that the cars pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be less cars used in our lives .

Another reason of my inclination is that the numberous cars make the cities become overcrowed and It is very unconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on .
For instance , in big city , It usually take one person live in outskirts one or even two hours to arrive the company he/she works in in the center of the city .
So this is very convenient a
.

Althrough I agree that there are a couple of advantages of using cars , but the disadvantges are more obvious , such air pollution , traffic jam , expensive fees for feeding cars .
Taking accounts all the factors and recognizing the facts discussed above , I would like to maintain there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now .

In a word , even though there are many different views towards this topic , as far as I am concerned , I will vote the opinion that there will be fewer cars in the future than in today , not the idea there will be more cars in the future .
