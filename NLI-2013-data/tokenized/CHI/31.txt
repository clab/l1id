People often can not come to the agreement even in the trivial issues that it is better or not to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
It is a little bit haste to say having broad knowledge have more benefits , and vice versa .

With the rapid development of academic subjects , the increasing number of subjects are difficult to understand deeply .
However , people 's abilities is limited and no time to study in many subject .
Face to the problems , you can not only use one specific subject to solve them .
You have to teach yourself and learn from other people in many academic subjects .
It also could broaden you horizon and accumulate all kinds of knowledge to deal with these problems .
Another benifit is give you many chance to challege yourself and dig up your real interests .
Furter-more , beacuse of the intension to broaden your knowledge of many academic subjects , you will ask others more and have more harmonious relationships .

But the problem may be more and more difficult , thus one people could not deal with alone .
That need someone have a deep understanding in one specific subjet .
Without the abilities , the problem could face to but could not to solve it .

Therefore , the saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is mainly depand on the circumstances .
According to my current situation , I prefer to study broad academic subjects .
Thus i could monmunicate a lot to other people and broaden my horizon .
When i found my real interest of subjects , i will pay much time on the specific subject , due to the interest is the best teacher , and then i will have the deep understanding of the specific subject .
Thus i think it is suitable for me .
