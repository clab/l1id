In today 's world , it is highly advantageous to know a wide spectrum of knowledge .
Since the chances that you may switch into another field increase day by day .
What 's more , a Mr know-all seems to be welcomed everywhere .

In my eye , however , it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to splurge too much efforts on unrelated subjects that may have nothing to do with your future life .

Firstly , every human being 's energy is limited .
Believe it or not , even a genius like Einstein could only dabble in other fields than physics , How can an ordinary doing too much in a short lifetime ?
Focused efforts do not pay off for everyone , not to mention scattered time and energy .

Secondly , to survive in this fullly competitive society and earn your bread in the rat race , you 'd better have your strenth .
Specializing on one specific subject can make you an expert , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may not most the time .

Thirdly , brought up by our country , we are all eager to do something for her in the future .
But without a deep knowledge in one specific area , how can we contribute largely to her ?
Take my major , ocean-engineering as an example , without specialized devotion in the style and designing of ocean-structures , we ca n't go any further in our future .

What 's more , there are too many things worth pondering over , if you are given the chance to pick some from an ocean of academic subjects , which ones are you going to selct ?
You may probably get lost in the immense subjects , or achieve nothing wandering among these subjects .

What I have argued above is based on my own experience , but we can neither go far when being tightly enclosed to a single subject .
It is better to have some know-how about your related subjects , but our major time and energy should go to one specific area .

`` Roman was not build in a day '' , so was the knowledge .
Dedicate more to your target , and you can achieve more .
