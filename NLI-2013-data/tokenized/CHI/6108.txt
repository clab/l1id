I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
My conviction is based on three reasons .

First , the low birthrate in many countries will cause a sharp reduction in the number of future drivers .
It is a well-established fact that the largest number of drivers are found in developed countries in North America , Europe and Japan .
It is also clear that birthrate has been dropping during the past decades in these regions .
With the reduction of population , there will certainly be a reduction in the number of drivers and cars .
It can be argued that China is a rising market for cars .
However , I do not believe that the growth in Chinese market will make up for the loss in other places .
Besides , the largest number of cars are found in the east coast big cities , where the streets are already jammed with cars and cannot make room to hold more .

Second , the gas shortage will help to reduce the number of cars .
The energy crisis that we are facing today will also be faced by the next generation .
Due to the limited energy supply on this planet , people in the future years will define gas shortage as a more serious problem than we do .
Considering the difficulty of discovering an alternative energy to replace gas , I am convinced that change of numbers of car will be pretty obvious in the near future .

Third , the reduction of number of cars is and will continue to be fueled by people 's rising concern of the environmental issues .
Over the past decades , people have come to realize that the substances emitted by vehicles will cause an unrevocable damage to our environment .
With the progress made in our understanding to the earth , it will become even clearer that cars using the currently available fuels will have a long-term , negative effects on the atmosphere and our health .

In summary , I have full confidence that , due to the low birthrate , gas shortage and people 's environmental awareness , there will be fewer cars in the twenty years to come .
