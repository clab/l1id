Today , there are many advertisements all around in our lives , and the purpose of them are attracting customers to buy products which advertisements are about .
But it also causes many problems in this society , such as some customers do not believe that advertisements are telling them truth of products .

I personally disagree with the statement , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
The reasons I doubt it are listing below .

First , as the tochnology gets better nowadays , advertisements can be made with many techniques , such as made by computer with many fantasy stuff .
While customers think that this advertisement is fantasy , it really doesn not mean that it doesn not tell them the truth of the products that the advertisement is about .
And the most important thing is that advertisement is just a advertisement , it does not force customers to buy products .

Second , the people who think that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are probably just make misunderstanding before they buy products .
And it really should not be companies ' fault because they do this is just for selling their products .
Customers have rights not to believe what advertisements say , buy they should not say every advertisement is not real .
It would be really unfair to the people who have spent a lot of time working on how to make good advertisements .

Whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not , it depends on different people and everyone has different thinkings about it .
