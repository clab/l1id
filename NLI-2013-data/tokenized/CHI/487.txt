As far as I am concered , a people , need not to say , should specialize in certain subjects for the sake of having living metold , however , I still take it for granted that people should have broad knowledge of many aspects .
This will not only make a person more knowlegeable and wiser , but also make the person 's life happier and more colorful .

First and foremost , people will lead a more confortable and convenient life on condition that they have the knowledge of lots of different areas .
For example , the people who has a basic knowledge of music , under certain circumstances such as pressure or saddness , will more likely to smooth their bad emotion eaiser than those people who do not ] : the people who are capable of playing some music instruments will tend to release themselves in playing some music works , which are entertaining and delightful , and few people will deny the efficiency of this kind of therapy .
To sum up , wide knowlege will give us more ways to deal with some emotional problems .

What is also worth noticing is that a person with lots of different knowledge tend to be much wiser than those who are constantly enclosed in a certain area .
For instance , A people with a wider range of knowledge will have a strong ability to analyse the problems which bother them in everyday life if they have the concept of critical reasoning .
This skill obviously will work wonder when people are contronted with a delimma , which forces them to make a choice , especially when it turns out to be relevant to a major event in one 's life .
Consequently , a well-around person is seemingly more well-equiped for huge changes which are always accompanied us in every walk of life .

Finally , though people ought to be brilliant at some specific subjects in one 's life , which is also of great importance to succeed in life , to be a person has the capacity of knowing lots of things also helps people a lot .
If we are well-around person it is obvious that we will enjoy our life with ease and simutaneously stand more chances to succeed in future .
