Personally , I totally agree with that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all , in fact , no matter closely or less closely , every subject is interrelated with each other .
We need broad knowledge of many academic subjects even we are majoring in a specific subject .
If we focus on one thing , failing to possess a wide span of knowledge of related subjects , we are even unable to be excellent in this given field .
For example , if we study physics , of course , we need to pay much attention on our physics books and remember all the complex rules .
But that is not all !
We need other kinds of knowledge to help us doing the physics studies .
We need to know about computer , which will help us with our researches ; we may need to know about English , in order to visit the foreign websites to see the latest developments in physics all over the world ; we may also need to know about lecturing , in order to spread our ideas or new discoveries .

Second , without the broad knowledge of many academic subject , we are unlikely to live an enjoyable life in today 's changing and integrited world .
Nowadays , the world has become more and more mixed , no matter in geographical sense or in cultural and academical sense .
We make friends with people from all over the world and we are no longer refrained within our little circles .
Our friends may be just specialized in totally different subjects or fields .
It is just unrealistic if we remain only familiar with solely one kind of knowledge .
So , in order to communicate with all kinds of friends and to boost interpersonal relationship , we must broaden our scope of knowledge .
Only by doing this could it be possible for us to lead an enjoyable and rewarding life in today 's world .

So , in a word , I think that it is high time we stressed on the importance of accumulating knowledge of many academic subjects .
