When an image of future world comes to mind , do you think that future cars are going to fly in the sky instead of driving on the ground ?
As far as I am concerned , there will be fewer cars than those of people imagine that will appear in the sky due to the following reasons .

First of all , there will be fewer cars in the future because the possible depletion of oil has alarmed people to explore other resources to replace mobiles that consume a great deal of oil each day .
Since the crisis of exhausting oil is around the corner , people nowadays are more eager to look for other resources that can replace the oil-consuming vehicles , or people just use oil-free transportation to achieve the goal of saving energy , like bycicling to work .
Due to the fact that everybody has a concern about energy shortage , people will gradually decrease the amount they drive right now and the cars they produce and buy in the future .

Secondly , to solve the problem of oil shortage , governments will put more emphasis on the development of public transportation .
For example , Taipei , the city where I grew up , has become more convenient due to its public transportation , the MRT transportation system .
Since the MRT can easily take people to to any corner of Taipei city with less time , why should people spend time whining in cars during traffic jams or zigzaging on roads ?
Hence , i believe that people will less motivated in the future to drive or even to buy a car .

To summarize , a highly well-developed public transportation will be every government 's first choice to explore in the future .
If all can well utilize the public transportation , our descendents will no longer to brook the pollution caused by cars .
