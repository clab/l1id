I agree with the title statement .
youung people enjoy life more than older people .
I can demonsteat form three aspects of it .
First , young peole has more activities to do .
Young people can go to travel to any where in any condition or do all kinds of sports even they are not good at them , But he older people because of some kind of sick .
they could not take some traffic like the ship .
There are also some sports because of the age problem , they could not enjoy it .
and we often see some instruction on playground .
some really good games are have age restricted .

Second , young people 's mind are operer than the old ones .
they are easier to accpet and learn new things .
for instance , the internet .
young people can use email or some on linetool to communicat to each other like msn or skype , but the older people could not .
for example , my mother can just simple look through the internet .
it is not that easy to send email or chat on the inernet , that is because the speed of typing for is very slow .
for my grandmother it is a problem even she wants to sufer on the internet .
Computer games have so much fun , but they could not enjoy them .
so young people enjoy life more than the older people do .

At last , young people has good boy to enjoy life .
the older people often trapped by the heath problem .
when they become older .
they often get some serious illness .
sometimes to move is a problem for them .
they can just lay on the bed .
but the young people can go to club or just enjoying to run in the rain or fight to each in the snow .

From what we talked above , we can draw the conclusion : young people enjoy life more that the older do .
that is because they have have good body .
They have operer mind to accept and learn new thing .
