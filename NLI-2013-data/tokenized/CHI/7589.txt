With the statement of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , diferenr people have defierent ideas depending on their own personalities and personal experience .
And in my view , I most like to agree with the statement .

I know it is irrational to assert an point without anlyzing , so I 'll get a help of my own experience .
Last summer holiday , some friends with me have a travelling to the beautiful coast city Dalian , which locates in the nothereast of China .
The reputation of Dalian is very good in China , and surely we are all delitly for the chance of travelling to the beautiful city .
But things not always go on as we wished .
As the strangers , we are exciting for its fatastic landscape while arriving in Dalian .
For the sake of saving money , we have n't hire a guide , and we thought a map could handle .
The coming things prove that we are wrong absolutely .
Soon after the exciting , the sunset s coming , we faced the problem of accomodation .
The summer is the best season for touring in Dalian , thus all the rooms are reserved .
At last we only ask for helps from taxi driver , and eventually he sent us to a hotel in suburan , which locates far from the city center .
In the following days , we are all depressed , as a result of withouting a tour guide , we just paid most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in Dalian is not terrible .
We just searched our routine all the time .
Hence , it is really a low quantity travelling .

In otherwise , if we have the travelling with a guide , the situation will be better .
First of all , we can easy cope with the accomodation and routines .
What 's more , once we have a tour a famous place , we just know it is famous but have no sense of why it is so prestige .
Therefore , if I will travel to another city or place I 'm not familar with , I 'll set up accompany with a guide for certain .

Travelling is just like the studying , and the guide is like the teacher , when we have problems we well ask helps from teachers , and role of the guide is the same in travelling .
