We are living in a society surrounded by various adivertisements which not only appear on TV shows , newspapers and internet , but also on other occasions , such as subways , bus stops , or even on the bulloons flying in the sky .
Some people think all these ads make them easier to get access to the products they are not so familiar , while others consider it a obligatory input of business management .

In my opinion , both of the comments are reasonable .

As we all know , with the development of modern technologies , our life style is more and more following a faster pace .
So when we are considering purchase of our necessities , it is a little time-consuming to pick up the products from the others .
Ads help us to go through the choosing process .
Many ads maybe exaggerate their effects , for example , the advertising pictures showed on the internet do have some difference from the original products , but since all of them are exaggerating in some level , considering that , they would be equal as well , which is understandable because every company has to beautify their products to make profits .

However , sometimes some ads boosts their products so much that it would be actually undermine the effects , for they will be too good to believe .
But this kinds of ads should be prevented in case some people would be cheated on that .

What is more , it is very discouraging and disappointing to discover that the products you have bought is not as good as the ads said .
I can take our wireless internet access for example .
We installed the high speed internet last year , and we are expecting to enjoy the high-speed online surfing service , but it turned out to much slower that what it said on the promotion handbook .
So after that , I am becoming more and more convinced on the statememt in the topic .

To sum up , according to my experience , many ads will certainly more or less exaggerate their properties , I 'd better choose from them carefully .
