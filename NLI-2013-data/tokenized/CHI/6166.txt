Will there be fewer cars in use than today in twenty years .

At the same time cars bringing people convient lives and more goods , they are making pollution to the enviroment and great traffic problems .
Nowadays , the governments are doing their best to limit the number of cars , the scientists are tring their best to invent new kind of traffic tools and the public begin to know the importance of protecting the neture .
Therefore I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years .

First , governments should ask for higher tax for buying cars , and this will make less people have the eager to have a car .
Providing more public triffic tools is necessary for the governments as well .
In addition , convient traffic lines and fine road condition is also significient elements .
Imagine that one can get his goal place quickly and conviently by a kind of public traffic tool , who else would like to have his own car with high price of oil and high tax ?

Scientists have someting to do as well , however , they are tring hard now .
In the next 20 years , scientists are supposed to invent more kinds traffic tools .
Now in Shanghai China , we has Cixuanfu rail train which has srong power and produced with sophiscated technique .
I am looking forward in the future this kind of powerful now kind of train could be common in the world .

At last , more and more people refuse to travle by cars .
They would choose ride a bike or play a weels-board .
The pollution made by harmful gas from the nostiles of cars , ramain more and more people of not using cars as traffic tools .

So , in conclution , with the coorperate between the governments , scientists and the public , I believe that there will be fewer cars than today in 20 years .
