I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group lead by a tour guide .
Since traveling is often for leisure and entertainment , traveling in a group with a tourn guide would restrict my individual interests , my pace , and the intimacy of the group dynamic .

First , traveling is supposed to be enjoyable for the tourists .
Although a tour guide may be able to lead the group toward the major and well-known attractions , in his or her attempt to appeal to the majority of the tourists , many tourists ' individual interests may be compromised .
For instance , if the town is internationally famous for its wine but also has a nice but small museum of WWI artifacts , the tour guide is most likely going to focus on wine tasting rather than the historical artifacts .
However , one of the tourists in the group may be a history buff and is hoping to expand his collection of WWI artifacts , he or she may miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime conforming to group interests .
Thus , in many such cases , traveling is better done individually or in a small group of friends rather than in a group led by a tourn guide .

Also , traveling is a chance to only to see and experiences new things but also to unwind .
Thus , the pace offered by a tour guide may restrict one 's ability to relax .
For instance , in a tour group , there may be people of all ages groups .
Typically , the younger tourists would be more energetic , attempting to see everything and speeding up the group 's pace .
However , the older people in the group may just be hoping to relax and enjoy the view at few select locations .
Thus , the disparity between the goals and pace of the tourists in the group may restrict many 's traveling experience and may even be the cause of additional stress .

Finally , much intimacy and freedom is loss when traveling in group led by a tour guide .
Since tour groups are usually composed of random people across the nation , or even across the world , it may be difficult to feel comfortable in their presence .
Also , when traveling in such a large and unfamiliar group , freedom of speech and behavior is lost .
For instance , with adults around , teengers wo n't be able to blast the music they love on the radio and with the children around , the adults wo n't be able to talk about many of the personal details of their life .
Conversation tend to become more superficial and restricted .
Hence , in many cases , traveling in such a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice .

Thus , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
With restricted interest , pace , and freedom , I would not have a good traveling experience and I think many would feel the same way .
