Today , we talk about the issue is about did the new generation really spend enough time for their communities activities or not .
According to my opinion , i agree that they do not actually had enough time to help the communities that they involved .

When we talk about the main communities for the young people is the family and the school .
And I will talk about how they did n't do them best in this two communities .

Family Communities .
As we know that , when the people growed up , they do n't want to depends on parents more , all of them want to got another sky for themselves .
But do it means that we do n't need to spend more time for family ?
Do it means they should seperate from the family ?
I say no .
Cause the family communities is actually the base for everyone , it 's also a strong supporter for everyone .
And how to build a successful relationship into family is really important .
From such reserch from teenages criminals , the percentage of teenages criminals are growth year by year , and there 's nearly 60 % of the teenages had bad relationship with family .
So , we can know that those social problem occurs actually because the teenages did n't really spend time to build a good relationship with family .
So , if they even do n't spend time with them family , how can they say they helped out with the family communities .

Shool Communities .
Did u ever seen the report about school violence issues ?
Did u saw the pictures shows the student shooting their classmates ?
That 's what had happened in this world now .
School Communities , is the people spend most time when they was young .
When we saw those bloody conflicts had happend in school , we could know that this is the evidence we say they do n't give enough time to help their communities .
They did n't spend time to talk to them classmates , they do n't want to working with friends , They can spend more time in msn but not in class .
They do n't participate the school activities cause they are not interesting .
That 's why we say they did n't really help out the school communities .

So , beside in this two reason , we know they did n't do them job ,
