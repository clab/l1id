Some believe that it isbetter to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
But other one believe the negative attitude .
In my opinion , the answer of this state is depend on one 's personal experence and the life stile .

Now , the society is more and more complex , so broad knowledge are needed for people to fit it .
So , if one peason only want to get a batcher degree from the university and will go into the society to earn themselives , they shoud have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in order to fit the society better and quicker .
Due to the blank of employment situation , broad knowledge of many academic subjects will offer more oppertunities in the job market .
For example , one peason who have the knowledge about PC , soft ware , physical , and electrical has more oppertunities to be hired by a IT company iIT .

But , as we know , more and more information is contain in one academic subject , so it is diffcult , even is impossible , for someone to master all the information in one subject , not to say many academic subjects .
So if someone want to learn some information about one subject better , he/she would better learn one subject and specialize in one specific subject .
For example , one peason is interested in biology very much and want to got a PHD degree about it , it is not need for he/she learn more about history .

In a word , the answer of which choice is better depend on one 's personal experence and the life stile .
To someone , have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better ; but to other one , specialize in one specific subject is better .
