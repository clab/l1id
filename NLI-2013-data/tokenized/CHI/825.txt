Some people believe that it is better to have broader knowledge than specialize knowledge , others think not .
In my opinion , I would agree with this statement .
There are many reasons as followed .

To begin with , we could combine many different knowledge into one way .
If we learn as many academic subjects as we can , we might put them together one day , and inventions will happened .
Take the invention of cellphones for example .
As we know , somone invented traditional phones , he used his academic field to invent it .
But , nowadays , we increase the profits on many special kinds of cellphones .
That is , what will make commercial profits ?
It is not only the professional part but also combines others , such as ads and designs .

In addition , we can communicate with each other by using other several academic knowledges .
In the other words , our friends may appriciate us because of our wide knowlege .
We will not have a good social relationship if we only concentrate on our own field .
It is because that we are too boring to stay with .
Thus , we should get more and more academic subjects as we can , then we can chat with any kinds of friends who take part in different fields .

However , we should also specialize our academic subjects .
It is because that when we work in our professional part , we should give a confidence to our customers , it is impossible that we put too many emphasis on other things but cannot answer any questions which our customers asked .
Moreover , we should study hard to our own academic field and we could get a better job than broader knowledge .

As all reasons I have mentioned above , the first is that it is important that having broad knowledge to combine them into a new one .
The second reason is that it is easier to communicate with any kinds of persons .
Furthermore , if you want to get a better job , you should specialize your academic subjects .
