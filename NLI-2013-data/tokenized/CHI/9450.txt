Recently , many students try to find an effective and efficient way to study , but they are always confused by the dilema : Understanding ideas is the first priority or learning facts is more important ?
From my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts other than learning facts .
And this can be fully explained from three aspects : First , nowdays people have more access to those facts so they do n't have to memorize them ; Second , Understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable ; Third , understanding helps students to develop creativity , which is the key force in this technology world .

First of all , facts are easy to be found .
Nowadays people have a variety of ways to acquire data and information .
Books , magazines , Internet , video tapes are all the powerful resources which help students to learn facts .
For example , a student can easily get what happened in Canada in 1870 from the internet , He or she just simply type : `` What happened in Canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .
Moveover , the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before , so what is the point to try to memorize all the terms and fact ?
It is a waste of time obviously .

Second , Understanding is more important to get ideas .
It is better to teach a man fishing skills other than just give him fishes everyday .
For example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do n't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time I give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ? '' , you still do n't know how to do it .
On the other hand , if you know the rule of addition , that 's much enough .
You do n't have to memorize any facts such as `` 1 + 56 = 57 '' , you can do any addition questions .
That simple .

Last but not least , understanding helps students to be more creative .
As we know , this is a technology era , creativity seems more important than just accepting .
In order to understand , a student has to push himself thinking in a deep level , which helps to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skills .
The more a person thinks , the more knowledgable he or she tend to be .
Hence , he or she will understand more and be more creative .
This is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation .

In conclusion , learning facts is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential .
Understanding ideas can let students be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing facts is just a waste of time .
So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
