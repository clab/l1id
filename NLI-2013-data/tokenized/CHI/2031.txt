Every person should enjoy their life as much as they can .
The life is not long , and it will end .
So should n't we enjoy our lives when we are young ?
I disagree the statement , and I think older people enjoy life more than young people do .

First , older people usually have more money than young people do .
When you have money , you have the power .
Money is everything .
Although sometimes people say money ca n't buy happiness , without money you ca n't do anything .
Old people can use these amoung of money to travel everywhere around the world , and buy anything they want .
In th other hand , young people start to find a perfect job .
The power in them are not much .

Second , older people usually have family , which is the happiest place to be .
When they see their childern grow up , they enjoy that happiness .
When they have the grandchildren , the happiness become more .
Old people have their own family to hang out with , they share everything everyday .
But young people do n't stick around the house very often .
They want to play , and they do n't want to be controled .
Although they are happy with their friends , not with parents .
They 'll miss that .

Final , older people have more time than young people do .
Old people do n't worry about the work because maybe they are already retired , or they already have the position in the company .
They can relax as much as they want without worrying their job .
But young people have to work hard everyday and try to improve themselves to their boss .
They try to find the mate , but they are too busy to find .
Young people ca n't enjoy themselves because they always have the pressure in mind .

I am a young people now , and I try to balance my school and relax time .
I ca n't say I am enjoying the life right now because I have n't get my goal yet .
I want to be successful , and then having fun .

I realize that the only way to enjoy the life is working hard as a young people and playing hard as a old people .
