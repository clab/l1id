Everybody will face with choices during life time .
Some people may just choose the safe things instead of risks .
However , I believe if one , no matter whick field he or she is in , has the desire to be successful , taking risks will be a necessary step .
There are three reasons as below .

First of all , people need to try risks while making dicisions about economic events .
Money is an important part of everyones 's life .
In order to manage money well and make more money , people are always surrounded by risks .
For example , business managers have to choose which product to sell and which good to buy .
In this case , they have to think about the adventure .
They may earn profit from their choices ; otherwise , they will loose both profits and basic funds .

However , to be successful , they have to take risks .

Another reason why I agree to take risks is that risks also appears in scientific areas .
To illustrate , during the old time , scientists who were doing reseach about chemistry had to test those dagerous chemical elements without effective proof .
In addition , Edison damaged his ear while examing the light .
Obviously , in these successful examples , sicients all faced with the risks .
Instead of retreating , successful scientists bravely took these risks .

Not only do scientists take risks , but also politicains need them .
For instance , when politicians need to clarify their opinions , they have to give speechs and talk with a huge amount of people .
In this case , there may be some killers , who hold the opposite idea , waiting on their way .
Although it is a risk for politicians ' life , they have to handle it and face it as long as they want to succeed .

After exploring these reasons above , it is not hard to conclude that taking risks is really essencial to be successful .
Business men , scientists and politicians have shown people this rule .
Therfore , taking risks should become a crucial step in the process of being successful .
