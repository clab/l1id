Divided into two kinds of eduction , schools are focus on different methods of education .
However , they can be distincted into two portions , one is focus on having broad knowledge , the other is focus on having specialize in one specific subject .
Both of these two ways are leading students to the prosperity in the future , and sure can be successful if the right education is given .
But which one of these two ways can lead a more prospective future ?
That can be a question we have to consider .

However , I vote for the method , I 'm been taking , that is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Living in the developed world , nowadays , we , the new generations , have gotten more and more burdans .
The technology is growing faster and faster , more and more knowledges should be used in only one job .
To have different knowledges in different part of academic subjects has become more and more useful .
A worker who want to earn more payment needs more knowledges in different academic subjects , to make the work s/he is doing get better .

With the developement of the technology , to much knowledge a person need to know to work with an equipment , an equipment may needs the knowledge of electronic , computering , programming and so on .
My father is an manager of Guizhou North Power , for instant , he needs the knowledge of programming to program the programs of computer that used in equipments , he needs to have the knowledge of electronic for the using of the program , he also needs the knowledge of management to make the company better .
To much works need the broad knowledge that can the developement of the company get fast .

What about the knowledge of specialize in one specifc subject , it 's not adequate any more .
For a job , a person wo n't do it best when s/he only have the single knowledge in one specific subject .
The person may good at accounting , but not good at using computer ; a person may good at mathematics , but do not no how to use it .
This can cause a gift person lost his job and destroy the one 's future .

So , what I think is that the single knowledge in one specific subject like spin , it can destroy the bulloon in your hand .
Not useful any more in the new generation , the single knowledge in one specific subject can make the person do not know how to use his tellent .
To have broad knowledge can make the person easier to use his knowledge and become successful in the future .
