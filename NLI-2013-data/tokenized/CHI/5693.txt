We can see any kinds of advertisements on TV .
Some of them are creativity and make the products look useful .
What is the purpose of the advertisement ?
We can understand in following reasons .
First , customers is willing to buy the product after watching the advertisement .
Second , Give the customers enough information about the product in a short time .
Third , there are many competitions in the same kind of product .

Even though the sales understand their product is good , customers will never know that if they never buy it .
All they can do is to show their products in advertisements .
Although sometimes it seems much better than they really are , it is just strategy .
Other companies also use the same way .

We all know that if the advertisements want to be watched as many viewers as they can , we should put it in the popular programs .
It costs a lot of money .
If we cannot give customers enough information about what the product is , it just wastes money .
The best way is to pretend it is really attractive and useful .

Sometimes customers do not understand what the difference between one company 's product and others ' products is .
The only difference is the advertisement .
Every company tries to make their product look better than they really are .

In conclusion , although I would like to buy the product better than it shown on advertisment , i do not how to choose the product if i have never used it .
I will choose the product in a good advertisement .

I agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
