It is a controversial issue whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject .
Depending on personal experience or pesonality type , some will support the former one , while others will choose the later one .
But it is too absolute to say that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject .
In short , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects has countless advantages , otherwise , to specialize in one specific subject has a great number of advantages too .

As far as I am concerned , to have broad knowledge of many academic can help you to have a more colorful life than the to specialize in mere one specific subject .
Some people do not like to focus on one single subject for it is too boring for them to learn due to their own personalities .
Futhermore , to have broad knowledge is the significant skill because all the things are related .
It is much easier for the people to deal with the things in other fields of areas .
Maybe it will help the people to earn more money .

Though to have broad knowledge has the many advantages , to specialize in one specific subject also has great advantages .
If people specialize in one specific subject , he or she can learn more about the knowledge and have deeper understanding of the subjects he or she concentrates on .
There is no doult it will help the people to get a good job in their areas .

In my point of veiw , either to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject should be according to the personalities of different people .
If you can enjoy yourselve in either , this will be the perfect choise you make .
