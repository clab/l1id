Some people believed that older people enjopy life less than young people , because the young people are active , erengetic and maybe have more time .
But in my opinion , it is not ture , there are at least three reasons for my believe .

First of all , most older people have their clear goals for their lives , after more experience , they know more the more meaning of lives , and know themselves more .
Then they could easily choose their type of ilves based on the real surroundings .
It is exciting and meaningful thing to churse up the goals they have .
So they will feel enjjoyful during the time to get goals .

Another important reason of my believe is that the older people have more chance to do the things they want , because they have ability to arrange their time and have enough money to help the ti \ hing they want come true .
For instance , many people like travling , no matter young people or older ones , but the young people it is much more difficult to have a comfort trip than older people .
Obveriously , the young must face to much problems , The last but no least reason for me is the older people experience more will understand more fact of the problem in everyday lives , they can easilly face to the bad things which cannot change , avoid bad things before it happened , solve the problem which had been happened .
On the other hand , older people cherish the beautiful moment more than the young people , because they understand it is difficult to have the changce .
So in front of the real life , even bad things happened , older people will have more enjoythings to do
