Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people , because then think young people may have more energy , however , in my opinion , both of them enjoy life very much but in different aspects .

First , to young people , they consider life to be exciting and full of enthusiasm .
Therefore , the prefer to express their enjoying behavior external , like playing some stimulating sports , go hiking to some dangerous places with thir cooperates and friends .
Futhurmore , they may eat spicy food , wear strange coats whatever they want , it is a approach that young people enjoy their life .
On the other hand , because of their young , they have to vork for their rest of life , which means they should accumulate their properties , do work assiduous in order to have a comfort life when they are old .

Then , to old people , they have worked for most of their life , and when they became old , they have the oppotunitis to spend leisure time on enjoying .
Moreover they already possess adequate money for themselves to enjoy their rest of life .
Also , the olds know actually about what they want and where they want to go , and their sufficient life experience make them full of intellingece , they could obeserve life insightly , the way the enjoy , for instance , is only a cup of tea , or look the scenery out of the window .
Bigger inspiration they want perhaps to travel around earth , to see some things then had never seen , to go to some places they had never went to .
Old people can even enjoy the life more in contrast to the young people , they are the people who are no longer interfered by earning money and strain life work .

From my point of view , in summary , we can not say who enjoy more , because all the people acquint themselves with theway of enjoying life , and know the crucial meaning of enjoying life and releasing themselves , though they do it via different way and holding different emotion .
