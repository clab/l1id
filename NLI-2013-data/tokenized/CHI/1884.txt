every long holiday , we can see a lot of young people playing at parties , going shopping , traveling and taking partites with their friends .
abd most of their psrents stay at home .
that is a common phenomenen in many societies .
from this scene , we can see young people enjoy their life than the old people do .
in my point of view , this situation may based on several reasons .

the young love to try new thing , and they are easier to master a new technology .
they tend to live in a stimulating life .
for example , during my travel , i have met a 19-year-old boy , he told me that he made this travel for jumping .
i am surprised and did n't know why he wanted to `` jumping '' .then he told me that is a kind of new sport item .
he would jump from a high mountain or a gliff !
the reason he was fasinated with this is just because he was trying new things .
he has enough courage to enjoy himself by this wat , but the old ca n't .
we are young , we can meet challenge physically and mentally .

the second reason is that the young spend money more generous .
the old should thnk about their future without salary and the money prepared for a heavy disease .
but the young can spend all money they have earned .
an australian told me that the average saving of australian young people is 4 dollars .
they uses all money enjoying themselves .
of couse , you can spend money on clothes , ps2 , computer , etc.it makes the young 's life more colorful .

and the society also help the young to enjoy their life .
when my family went to a ktv .
i can choose all songs i want to sing , they are all pop songs .
but when my mum wated to select an old song , she felt disappointed , because there is no traditional songs in the song store !
so the whole society create an environment for young to entertain themselves , that helps us to be more convient to enjoy life .

in conclusion , young people have more money , more time and more situation to make their life more wonderful .
but the old are hardly to get an opptunity to enjoy their life .
i thing maybe different methods lead to different life styles , some old enjoy themselves too .
it may depends on people 's charactistic .
but mre young people enjoy themselves than their parents and grandparents .
