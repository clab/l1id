I agree with the following statement .
Becuase am not a child , i can do many things by myself , and can do it well .
First hand , i think many people want have their own place , they can think and they can do anything they want to do .
Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people have many things to enjoy life .
Such as shopping , swimming , singing , running and so on .
There are much way to enjoy .
But old people have not so many things to enjoy life .
They like to go out for a walk , and watching newspapers .
Sometimes they like to be with their childrens to have dinner .

Second hand , i like to do something myself , i do n't like to do something that 's allowed by my parents .
I will fell some incomfertable .
I want to have many time to do my things .

I like travelling and i want to go to HongKong and America one day .
I like America so much , i want to study there with many new firends , I want to meet many new firends in America .
But my parents do n't want me to make a lot of firends , they want me to study everyday .
But i do n't want to study everyday , i want to have some free time that only for me to stay with my firends .
So , i think i do n't the statement is right .

I like cartoon best , but many parents think that is nott a good thing .
They think only child can watch it .
But i lke it , i want to be a cartoon maker one day .
I want to go to America to study how to make cartoon .
I feel that is intresting in my life .

At last but not the least , i agree with the following statement .
I think young people enjoy plfe more than old people do .
