While we start learning something , we have to understand the ideas and concepts first .
It seems to be critical for us to learn those things first so that we can build the foundation of what we are going to learn .
Actually , if we just understand the concepts or ideas and we do n't understand the facts .
Eventually , we are not really learning something .
From my point of view , to understand ideas and facts are both important .

There are wide variety of examples in our daily lives can prove my view point .
I am taking psychology class right now .
Last week , my teacher talked about how to analyze dreams .
I got to learn the basic concepts of analyzing dreams .
When I understood the concepts , I wrote down one of my dreams to my teacher .
Then , she analyzed it for me .
As a result , it was not really accurate about what I thought and what I was going to do .
Then , she told me that fact and concept might not be the same ; therefore , we had to learn both .

On the othe hand , if we are going to learn sports .
First of all , we will learn concepts and how to play .
Then , we will get to learn skills .
Can we just learn the concepts and we will be good at it ?
We must practice and play games so that we can learn the fact that what will it really happen while a game .
We may not be able to use all the ideas while we play the game .

To conclude , students must understand both ideas and facts .
Those are crutial for out learning .
We ca n't lack either one during our learning processes .
