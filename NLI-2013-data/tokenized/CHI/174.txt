I agree with the saying that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
Altough private cars have played an impotany role in people 's life nowadays and people tend to more depend on the use of the cars , I think this situation still will change a lot in the future twenty years .

Twenty years is not a very short time , it can mean that one generation have grown up and become the most dorminant people in the society .
In many developing countries , the children nowadays have been taught more about the importance of protecting our environment , otherwise mother nature will punish humankind for what they had done .
So when these children become adults in like twenty years , they will do better than their parents in the aspect of environmantal protection .
What is more , there is already a lot of events in both developing and developed countries that people automobally decrease the use of the private car .
For example , I heard a lot of people in western countries nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmates , or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city .
And in China , there is also news about some elementary school students persuade their parents not to use car to send them to school , these parents then receive their suggestions and use bicycle to pick their children .
So we can see from these events that people have become more and more concern about their environment , this is why maybe the use of car will drop in the future .

Some other factors also can make changes in the use of car .
First , the price of oil has become much more higher than before and continue to increase .
Maybe many people in the future can not afford such high price and change their way of going outside .
Second , there are also a lot of convienient public transportations in the city .
Such like subway , bus , railroad .
This kind of transportation is not expensive and can attain anywhere you want in the city , and especially the subway can not be influenced by the terrible traffic above them .
It can save people a lot of time , and it is quiker than driving a private car .
So , the high price of oil and the convinence of taking public transportation can make effort to the decrease of the use of cars in twenty years .

In conclusion , there are some reasons why there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In my opinion , the most important is that people in the whole world can realize how serious that using too many cars can make our blue earth a dirty planet , .
