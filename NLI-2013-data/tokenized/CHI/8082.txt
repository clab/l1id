Nowadays , more and more students start to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
Actually it is a very good way for they to succeed in their studying fields because of the following reasons .

First , ideas and concepts are the roots of any study .
If a student does not understand the ideas and concepts , how can he/she find relations with the real life ?
Facts are revelant to the ideas and concepts , but after ideas and concepts are discovered , then we can apply the ideas and concepts to the facts .
So ideas and concepts are more important than facts .

In addition , ideas and concepts can apply to problems while studying .
As mentioned , they are the origins of the studies .
Therefore any problems related to the study should be based on the ideas and concepts or they can be expansions of the ideas and concepts .
For instance , in geometry studies , there are a lot of theories in a circle .
The theories are the concepts and ideas .
From these theories , teachers can develop more and more problems .
If a student does well in the circle test , he/she must have mastered the ideas and concepts of the circle very well .
Or he/she would not get good mark just by learning facts .

Futhermore , while doing a lecture about some course , the students are required to expand his/her topic from the ideas and concepts .
They are not taught to give the lecture right from the facts .
Because starting from the facts will make the lecture hard to be accepted by others who are not familiar with the topic .
The ideas and concepts are always the basis of any lecture .
Afterwards , the facts can be displayed fully to the listeners .
This is what a memorable lecture requires .

In conclusion , ideas and concepts usually are the paramount factors of any study .
Therefore , it is more important for sutdents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .
Then they will be mastering knowledges better in the future .
