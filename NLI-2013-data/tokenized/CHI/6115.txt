Some people argue as if it was a general truth that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today , so there was no need for me to put any emphasis on what the disadvantages of cars were .
But to the frank , I did not agree with the title statement .
There were numorous reasons why I held no confidence on them , and I would explore only a few primary ones here .

The first reason for my choice could be obviously seen that the price of the cars had been more and more cheaper in recent year .
Because many car companies reduced their price in order to attracting customers and got the ideal profits .
And they would not care about what bad influences the cars would bring about .

The second reason for this problem could be involved that people had more free money to buy cars with the improvement of living level of people .
Perhaps , a family with three persons had three cars for each one .
Moreover , in some people 's mind , the cars was a sign of social position and powerful authority .

Of course , I also designated that the vehicles had a couple of merits , such as convinient , save time and so on , these ware the aspects of itself that could attract people to buy it .

The last fact showed that the goverment did not have the laws which were relative with cars and had ever never to restrict the number of vehicles .
Although everybody knew that the cars would make pollute in our country , there were still so many people to buy cars and the goverment did nothing about it by laws .

As far as I was concerned , I came to the notion that I did not support that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I put my standpoint to believe that there are more vehicles in the furture .
