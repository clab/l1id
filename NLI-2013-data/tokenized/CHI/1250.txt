In general , to master of lots academic subjects is a good way to have a broad knowledge and might have a good carrier starting in the future .
So many people like to broaden their knowledge in taking many academic subjects , but others do not want to .
I prefer to make more subjects to advance my knowledge for a few reasons .

First , it is not a knid of easy to enter a university , once entering a university , it provides a good chance to get more subjects than others cnnot have a chance to enter the university .
If you take more subjects you would become more respomsible and more organize the timing .
I took many subjects on the same semester so I make a wise schedule for myself , and I fell kinds of satisfiy by myself .
Thus , I think its a good ways to take more subjects to broaden knowledge .

Second , I could advance by meslef in other objects and help people in taking more subjects , for example , I do not need to take a course of medical beacuse I am major in agriculture , but I encourage myself to brave to take it , and then , my roommate got a bacteria infection in the midnight and I immediately to get a right medicine to help her to reduce the pain and then sent her to the hospital .
Miracially , I finally became a nurse because I love to help people and make them good healthy .

For all of that , I do not mean my though was totally right , but I really enjoy and happy by myself in taking lots subjects in university .
It is a good way to obtain knowledge and have a productive life .
