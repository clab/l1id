Everyday we are forced to see all kinds of advertisements , from television , from radio and even from our post letters .
It gives us millions of information , and definately we are influenced by the advertisements more or less .
However , I have to say that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

From advertisement , people always see the good looking of the products .
For example , the advertisement of the famous brand shampoo , let 's just call it P. We can see the beautiful long hair of many ladies , shining and falling , it is easier for people believe that if we use the same product , we will have the same kind of hair .
As a result , most of us can not have the same beautiful hair as the model .

Advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are , another reason is that the advertisements only show the good points of the products , they never let you know the bad side of it .
For example , there is a advertisement about a vacume cleaner , in the advertisement , you are told that it is powerful , easy to handle , and you are even showed that how clean the room is after it is used , however , after you buy it at home , after you actually try it , you may find that it is too big to handle , and it takes a large space to store .
I have a similar experience last winter .
After the first month of the winter season , I was unhappy to find the the gas charge was extramely higher than I expected , I noticed from the televison advertisement that there was some kind of heater seemd very good , it was powerful , good looking , and I went to the store and bought it at once .
After one days of use , I had to return it to the store because it made a lot of noises .
I was not told about the noise peoblem from the advertisements .

Most advertisements definately make peoducts seem much better than they really are .
That is the use of the advertisements .
So better check carefully before you purchase something .
