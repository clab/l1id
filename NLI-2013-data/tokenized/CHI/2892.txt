Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Other people disagree with the statement .
Personally , I think that young people do enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .
Young people have more strength , hope , and friends .

First of all , young people have more physical strength than older people do .
For example , young people can go swimming in summer , and go skiing in winter .
However , older people , such as people around eighty , cannot swim or ski anymore due to their physical strength .
Especially , sports like skiing are dangerous to them .
If they fall off , they might break their bones since they are not strong enough as they used to be .
Furthermore , young people can travel around and walk whole day long .
When young people go to other countries to travel , they can go to many places and enjoy the place as much as possible ; however , older people easily get tired and cannot move around as young people do .
They spend their time in hotel which is not very exciting .

In addition to having physical strength , young people have hope and dream toward their future .
For instance , young people study hard and try their best in order to achieve their dreams .
Even though they face some difficulties , they do not give up .
Young people have bright futures ; therefore , they put their effort into everything to create and change their futures .
On the other hand , older people cannot change their futures that much anymore .
They get up and eat and go to bed again .
Their daily life cycle would not change anymore .
Therefore , i think their life is much more boring than young people 's .

Lastly , young people have more chances to get to know many people , and they can make many friends who surely make their lives more exciting .
For example , when they go to school , there are many classmates , and when they go to company , there are many co-workers .
All the people they meet definitely have some influence on them .
When they have something happy , they can share their happiness to other people .
Furthermore , when they have some difficulty with anything , people around them might be able to help them .
Young people learn important things from people around them as they grow up .

It is clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They know how to entertain themselves by having more strength .
They know how to create better lives with hope by working hard .
They are influenced and inspired by many friends and people around them .
