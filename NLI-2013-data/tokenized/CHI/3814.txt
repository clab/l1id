If you say young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , I do n't agree with you .
Why I can say this because , young people do a lot of things to helping their communities .
Every year in my country , young people plant trees on their communities in MAY .
As now , I always rember that , my friend and I planted the trees together .
And in our collage , every people must work for the communities 5 hours one week .
But you can decide what kinds of work you want do .
some people decide do the volenter job , other people syqulit for the commnuitie .
last year , Idecided to serives tor the old pelple , who lives alone .
I go to LI 's home every weekend , I tooking about the news with him , and cleaning his room , taked him out to see the film or going shopping etc .
At first i realy do n't like do this , nobody want spend time on a old man , but after tolking with Li , I knew something that I never think about .
So , as I pass the 5 hours every week , I still like stay with Li .
This is my first time knowing how to take care the people around you , not only your family but also the peoples who you do n't knew .

Total young people were still colloge student I think , so we must lerning maybe all the day , so we have n't get enough time to help the communitie like other people .
But we still try to save our time to do something .

My friends and I , and I think most of all the young people would like to help the communities .
But because of the test or they should wrire the repoter or should fix the programe and something other things , we can not spend all of our time to do it .
But we wilill
