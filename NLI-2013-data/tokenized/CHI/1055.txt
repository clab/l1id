For me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in only one subject .
Because the more knowledge we gain the more opputunitues for having jobs we would have .

Having broad knowledge is the key element which we can gain jobs .
For example , I want to study accounting at university , and later I will have got the CPA .
However , I will choose to study how to direct film as my subsidiary major because if one day I am tired with my carreer as an accountant , I can stil choose another job as a director .

Secondly .
I think when we gain more knowledge we can learn a lot of beneficial things of those knoledge .
For instance , when we learn about the history , we can learn about the major facts or issues that happened in the past , we can try to circumvent those malicious facts such as the WW2 and other disasters , and we can make some improvments from those historiucal facts .

Thirdly , learning more things can give us another aspect of viewing the world .
From learning we can not only gain the knowledge from the academic subjects but also expand our minds .
For example , when I was a child I viewed everything in the world with a narrow mind , but since I went to the high school I lea

In conclusion , I agree on that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic sujects because it can give us more advantages than it gives us drawbacks .
