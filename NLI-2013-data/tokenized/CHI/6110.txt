Of course , the car is a kind of very important transfer tools .
Today , we can not go out without one car .
However , it has some problems resulted from using cars , like air pollution , traffic jam and so on .
So some people said that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .

I believe that the car is the essential tool which the number of it can not decrease .
First , because cars benefit our lives a lots .
For example , you can not image that the UPS employees transfers packages on foot .
All the recivers of these letters and packages would be very painfull .
And also all of the airlines would be explosed by thousands of people , if we want go to see someone near your city , I think the only way you can choose is by bike or by plane .

The problems that cars bring I think is the most major reason of some people think it will be fewer in the future .
Let us see that problems , first it would be the air pollution that is very bad for people 's heathy .
And maybe the oil resouses destory is another problem .
But these questions already be watched by scientists , and they are inventing and discoverying some new `` oil '' .
Depending on today 's techonlogies , it 's easy to deal .
Second , the traffic jam is a obvious problem , but some auto designers who I known in some auto company , like Benz , BMW , Ford , and so on , are developing some new cars that fit the city roads system .
Also , the more and more city planners realize this problem .
