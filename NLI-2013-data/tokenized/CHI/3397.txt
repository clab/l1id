I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
First of all , young people nowadays tend to care about themselves more than paying attentions to other people .
With the highly develop society , there are much more interesting and significant things occupying young people ' mind .
For instance , they would like to spend two hours or more reading books in the library or seeing vedios and playing computer games at home instead of helping their communities which may gain them nothing in the near future .

Furthermore , most young people nowadays are not aware of the idea of `` community '' anymore .
The identity of being part of the community is getting weaker and weaker .
Some of them even do n't notice about their living in a community .
For example , apartments o houses have bacome the main style of buildings nowadays .
Young people leave their houses in the early morning and come back to the very same place at late night .
How can we expect them to know each other with their neighborhoods ?
This kind of living style weakens young people 's identity of community .
Naturally , they will not pay attention to a society which they are unfimiliar with .

Finally , considering about this so-called efficeint society , tasks about communities are almost done by certain workers or employees of these communities .
By this way , a community becomes a epitome of a factory .
Everyone has it 's own job and only do what he or she is asked to do .
Take my family 's community as an real example .
We hired four people to do every task in our community .
By this way , we young people take tasks related to the community to be done by them as granted .

In summary , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because of individual reasons and also some unavoidable reasons such as modern structures of buildings .
However , I belive that young people should spend more time to enjoy with our community .
Via real careness to our communication , we can make our place to be better and impeccable in every aspect .
