I believe young people nowadays still give time helping their communities .
Young people these days still have the same attitude towards community services .
Most of the youth spend their vacation or weekends on vary kinds of services .
Community service is the main part of it .
They volunteer to do so since they know they have got no paid .
This shows the agressive attitude young people are taking towards doing such services .

There are some reasons can explain why young people nowadays stiil constantly helping their communities .
First of all , they believe that everyone still have the passion to make the world better by using their own power .
This thought had been in everyone 's mind since all of us was borned .
Everyone wants to help in any kinds of ways .
Therefore , teenagers join community services not only at schools , but also among their neighbors .
Needless to say , the youth nowadays still cares about our society .
They devoted themselves into many services including helping the communities .

In both government 's and companies ' perspectives , they tend to give teeanger chances to achieve their goal .
There are many opportunities outside that offers young people to help , such as local Non-Profit Organizations and Non-Government Organizations aften have a lot of activities that prevent jobs or chances to help communiuties .
The school also help giving oppertunities like garbage cleaning around the school neighborhoods .
It is obvious that people all want to help especially young people .

Over all , although everyone try to help , it really depends on every indivisuals whether they take actions or not .
I believe that every teeanagers nowadays have motive to help desparatly and also take their action immediately .
They indeed put a lot of effort in many kinds of community services nowadays .
