I think that it depends on what is the field of the academic subjects you are studying .
If the acadmic subjects is about science or other similar subjects which need some professional knowledge , that will need to specialize in the specific subject .
If the academic subjects is about education , bussiness or other similar subjects , that will need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In my concentration , education , I think I need the broad knowledge of academic subjects .

To have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects is very important in studying education .
Teaching has a lot of works to do .
If you want to make the learner understand what you are talking about , you will need to explain .
But if you know less , how can you make your learner understand what you want to talk about ?
The only way to solve the problem is to try to explain in many different ways untill your learner can know what you are talking about .
That is why you need to have broad knowledge .
Because when you know more , you can teach more and you can make more people understand what you want to talk about .

In other hand , if your subject is in those subjects which needs professional knowledge , it is better to speclialize in one specific subject .
Take science as an example : if you are studying the molecular biology , you needs many professional knowledge about biochemistry or molecular biology .
If you can know more , you will study more .
That will need more specific knowledge to make you learn more .
That is the reason you need to keep on studying specific knowledge .

To get the conclusion , my opinion of this topic is that it depends on what kind of subject you are studying .
If the subject you are studying needs to explain or combine other knowledge , you will need to learn more from other subjects .
But if your subject needs the professional knowledge , you would better to keep on studying more in your specific knowledge .
That is the only way to help to learn more and better .
