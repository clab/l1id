I totally agree this satement because I have been taught in this style .
Teachers always say the most important thing for being a student is that you need to comprehend the main ideas and concepts , which may either appear on the exams or use frequently in your lifespan .

I believe that the most of concepts and main ideas which had been examinated before published , so the concepts and ideas I have been studied are all based on facts , meaning they are all connected with each other .
If the new facts appears , it also will be modified or adapted into the concepts or ideas I 've been studing .
Therefore , I agree that learning ideas and concepts means learning that facts .

If the newly discovered facts conflicts with the established coincepts or ideas , how should those publishers do ?
Well , I asked this question to my professor before , and he told me that if the new fact conflicts the established concepts .
the specific evaluator will figure out the menthods to fix the original concepts .
For example , if the gravity were not 9.8 , the scientists will demostrate the experiments for both old results and the new fact .
Moreover , once they discover that the fact is valid , they will replace concepts with the new concepts based on the results from experiments , meaning the ideal concepts and the optimal ideas will modified according to the new concepts .
Therefore , the concepts and ideas I have been studying will be made sure whether or not it 's correct .

In contrast , apparently , the discovered facts are not always valid .
For example , there is one kind of fly whose eyes are red , which is the fact , but that kind of fly is a unique sample among differents kinds of flies .
Of course , scientist will add the new concept to adjust the old concepts , but Can we conclude that the eye color of flies should be red ?
That it , sometimes we need to use ideas or concepts to clarify whether this fact is valid or not .
Therefore , we will have thecorr
