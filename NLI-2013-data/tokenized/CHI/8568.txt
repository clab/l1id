Learing is a complex process .
It includes understanding ideas , concepts , learing process , and getting the facts .
There are discussions about which is more important during the learing process .
I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than just to know the facts .

As is known to all , during learning , we should not just care about the results , we should also care about the important ideas and concepts underlying the results .
We should make clear that we know how we can get the results , that 's how we can go through the understanding ideas , integrating concepts , and making derivarition to get the results .

Nowadays , because of the study competition , students care much about the grades they can get .
During study , sometimes , they just want to get the right answer without knowing why it comes to this not another .
Sometime , they even just memorize the results as to get the right marks in the test .
This is contradictory with the real goal of learing .
Facts are important , but the ideas and concepts we should learn through the process of getting facts are more important .
So the students should not just satisfied with the right facts , they had better pursue the right process through which we can get the right answer .

Learing prepare us the backgrounds , knowledge and technology for our future work .
This includes the ideas and concepts those are strongly confirmed .
The facts are just one kind of methods to help us understand ideas and conepts better .
The facts for different situations are different .
Even we know the right facts at this time , if we ca n't master the methods and technology gaining from the basic ideas and concepts which are used to get the facts , we wo n't get success in our future work .
In future practical conditions , everything is new , every problem is like a stranger to us .
We ca n't use the facts we memorized before to get the conclusion , we should try our best to use the ideas and concepts we have mastered to get the new conclusions .

In conclusion , I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts .
