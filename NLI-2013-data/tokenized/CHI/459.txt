regard of it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic sujects than to specialize in one specific subject , or vice versa , people have diverse opinions .
if i had my way , i would fully side with the notion that the specialization in one specific subject will be the most important , because of the survival in competition .

what is beyond a shadow of doubt is that we live in a world where the knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time the more specialized it is , the highly it is regarded .
on the other hand , competition is a way of life in today 's world , most notably the capitalists which encourage the competition , however , competition as always contribute both benefits and detriments , and has been brought the notices of us , not only because its tremendous benefits , but also widespread plagues .
for instance , individuals and companies alike , for the sake of survivial in the competition , have to try their best to improve themselves , and the competitive edge comes frome the quality that shows more variation .
that is specalization .

so , what we could deduce from general principles is that the competition , which is continually mounting and shows no signs at the present of ceasing to rise , cause the necessity and importance of specialization in a certain area .

however , if there is a view that people should obtain miscellenanious knowledge of many academic sujects , because by this , they could knew our colorful world , which i take leave to suspect , then it is the romantic and naive people who create it , not those who never fail to be with considerations of reality , in so far as it is universal acknowledged that studying many subjects would wast our time , on the other hand , we should maximaze our time to study something that will help us live in the competition .
and that is get a wealth of knowledge with specialization .

to explain my meaning perfectly , let me give you a concrete example .
due to the tempo of technology , which has never been such rapid as it is today , a new generation of school start-ups have been spawned .
Bill Gates , on behalf of this new , gives USA a jump on its rivals in software , however , if we assumed that Mr Gates would take the medical classes in the university , as well as the liberal arts , or even botany , just because he has large-range of interests , all the americans would be shrudded at the thought , because USA would fail to protect its competitive position in software , build and enhance its broadly based branches , and gain all the advantages of wider scale markets .
just because this awful imagination .

all things considered , if we deem the specialization as a trivial thing , and it will be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will be without any considerations of competition , as i mentioned and explained above , will lead a worse situation that is losing our competitive edge and chance for survivial in the competition .
