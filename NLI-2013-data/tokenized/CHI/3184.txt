Basically I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping or involving in their comminities .
Young people now live in a modern life that provides them with a lot more choices than they could have had in the past .
Internet is the typical example .
Young people spend a great deal of time surfing on net , whether doing research of school work , chatting with friends or playing online computer game .

There are also other attractions besides internet , such as travelling .
The improvement of transporation allow people to travel to other countries at faster speed and cheaper cost .
It was not common to hear or to see students plan to spend their summer vacation in another country or across the Pacific ocean back in the 60s or 70s .

Moreover , the development of modern society is also the main cause .
Population increase is associated with the growth of modern cities .
More people live in the cities , more children grow up in the cities .
A young man 's childhood in the city could be very different from the one spent his own in the country side .
Due to the different lifestyle , kids grow up in the citiy are generally more distant to strangers and people they are not familiar with .
They are possibly told by the parents and teachers to be aware of strangers when they are young as the crime rate is normally considered higher in the city , such as kidnapping .
Growing under this circumstances will naturally make them more self-centered and distant .

Another reason is probably because the relationship young people have with their comminity is rather shallow .
Most people , including adults and young people , rarely have any interaction with their neighbors .
As a result , they would not devote themselves to community activity ; they 'd rather to spend time focusing on their personal lives .
