I am not such kind of people who have many chaces to travel , but I do experienced some trips hitheto .
Sometimes I made my excursion by myself alone , sometimes with my friends and sometimes , of course , joined a group led by a tour guides .
Comparing all these ways , I should say that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way .

It is true that being led by a tour guide does has some merits .
For example , that will be safer and we can get more introduction and imformation from the guide in the trip .

But for me , I think the significant thing in a trip is the freedom and pleasure .
Why do n't we just stay in a library to seek the intorduction more derectly and excatly ?
The reason why I choose to travel is to get rid of all the unhappy thing in my daily life , trying a new surrounding , enjoying the ladescape , thinking nothing just being relaxed .

Without a guide , I can go any place I want to go , not only walking along the route decided by someone .
That should be moring interesting and exciting .

And also , I think the fee of a trip is another reason .
It will be more expensive to get a tour guide .
I wourd rather pay my money on some other things than on a tour guide .

So , next time I plan to have a travel , I wo n't adopt the way of having a tour guide .
Maybe just myself , maybe with my good friends , the point is the same , just go my or our own routs , enjoying the fexible and exiting trip .
