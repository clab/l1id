Some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but some of the others prefer to travel alone or with a couple of partners .
In my opinion , I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons based on my experience convince me that the best way to travel is alone or with partners .

First of all , self-organized travels maintains personal preferences on routes .
It would be dipressed that some places one wishes to visit are not on the tour list .
To travel alone hat the benefit of choosing whatever one likes and whereever one wants to go .
For me , traveling is a self discovering adventure .
Without the freedom to make decisions during the travel is lack of the meanings of traveling its own .

Secondly , i prefer to organize a tour on ones own because one would learn more and get the most of the period of time .
From collecting informations of the destination and researching the cultural differences , one abtaines so much more knowledge along with the planning .
Furthermore , planning the schedule would help one to get the basic knowledge of the trip .
On the contrary , in a group led by a tour guide limits the possibility to explore interresting facts of different cultures and also limits people 's incentives to get more to know about the backgroud of the place .

Thirdly , the flexible schedule makes travels more enjoyable .
Everyone who had followed a tour trip had had such experience of rushing to follow the schedule .
Self-organized travel is flexible that one can make decisions based on the weather , health conditions , or even mood .
For example , if one gets too tired from yesterdays schedule , one can just sleep more until the the energy gets back .
Flexible schedule not only adjust the personal condition better , but also brings out unexpected surprises during the trip , which is one the most wonderful part of traveling .
For example , five minute late for the bus might lead one to another route , but the other way which less traveled by might be more beautiful than the original plan .

In conclusion , there are so much more fun to travel alone or with a couple of partners rather than following the fixed schedules .
In my opinion , the most momorial moments in a travel are those which i did not expect .
