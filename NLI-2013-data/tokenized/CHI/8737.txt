There is a famous saying that says , `` all facts are made out of prejudice of our ancestors . ''
Hence , I agree with the statement .
Although facts can be seen as a short cut toward studying , I belive it is more important to teach the students ideas and concepts then lead them toward the knowing facts .
Going though this process , the student may have a changeable mind and an ability to turn ideas and concepts into facts .

If the teachers in school teaches only fact , the people who study there will become computers , for they only have to remember the text and they can pass the exams .
On the other side , the students have more challange and will learn more .
For example , if a biology teacher only teaches a frog is a slimy kind of animal that can live in both water and land , can the students pick the right animal when a turtle and a frog is presented to him .
On contrasy , if the students are given the idea of learning by experiencing themselves , the differences of the two animal shall be easy .

Another reason that I agree more on learning ideas and concepts are , most of the great inventions are started .
Youngs should learn how the great scientist acheve their success by starting on ideas and concepts others never or do not dare to think of .
Explaining the reflextion of a water based on the idea of light that run between the water and the face is more educational than just telling them , `` because there is a reflextion it is true . ''

Most importantly the students need to learn is the process between the ideas to the facts .
It is how things work and knowledge form , from the question you find to the solution you make after cutting out all the other posibilities .
Only if they get this ability , they can learn more and learn deep into the subject , and they can find the useful facts for life .
Therefore , by only understanding the process between the ideas and concepts to the facts , the students may really learn something useful for their lives .
