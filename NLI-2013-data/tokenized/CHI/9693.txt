I agree with this statement .
Successful always come from trying and taking risk .
People in the world all knew that if you want to become successful , you got to try .
You may learn a great experience while you are trying new things .
There might have something that you were afraid of and never want to try at all .
However by an accident you got to do this thing and you actually did it , this will give you encourae and you will feel very proud of yourself .
This is how successful works .
Those people ca n't become successful is because they do n't want to try , everythings just stay the same , always do the thing that they already know how to do well .
New things always let you grow up , if people rather stay the same they wo n't grow at all .

I was a very good example that rather try new things instead of do things that I already know how to do well .
When I was young , I do n't know how to ride bicycle , and i was afraid of it .
However i keep telling myself that `` if you wo n't try , you will never knew how to ride a bicycle . ''
And at first it was very horrible , i always fall down and get hurts .
Although i was not very good , i still try the new thing and I knew that i could become better and better .
Because of this thought and persverience , in the end I know how to ride a bicycle .

Form my example we can see the different between try new things and stay the same .
We always afraid new things taht we did not know about it .
But think about it , if you try the new things you will learn a new experience and you might like it after you try , so do n't just stay the same , try new things .
