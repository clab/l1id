Compared with traveling along , while most majority of people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , a small group of people choose to travel alone .
There are advantages and disadvantages lie on both sides .
When the question comes to me .
I would rather vote a tour guide all by oneself .

Indeed , traveling alone involve a large number of benefits .
The most obvious advantage is that you gain the maximal freedom when get to some places alone .
As a single tourist .
you may get rid of being regulated on the schedume by the tour guide .
you may make a paticular schedume special tailored for yourself and to meet your own demand while a tourist who follows a guide may not has such right to chose freely .
Therefore , the flexibility in making a plan serves as a significant force motived me to travel alone .

The second advantage is that you can also chose the place most satisfy your personal taste freely .
Just imagine about it , your guide foof your group forced you to visit a famous church , but unfortunitely what you really want to explore is a medievil castle nearby .
At this circumstance .
youhave to follow your group , therefor you have to follow the guide .
What a tragedy .

What 's more , from traveling alone , not only can you chose the place to visit freely , but also you can make a large sum of new friends .
shch opportunities can merely be obtained when you travel with a guide .
It is really exciting and fantastic .

On conclusion .
If there is one day I travel to a place far away , I would rather travel alone for the sake of freedom , flexibility and potential friendship I may gain from my jouney
