I agree with the statement .
We can forthseeing the future world .

Firstly , the energy crises is coming .
If we cannot find other source of energy , there will have no energy source for the cars .
The energy price will grow up many many times from now .
Citizen may travel by public-transport instead owning a car .
Moreover , the government will control the numbers of privite cars to control this problems .
Next , the mass-transit transport will carry most of the passengers .
So the needs of the cars is decrease .

Secondly , all vehicles will produces pollutions including electrical-vehicles .
It is because when generating energy , the there are many exhauted gas came out .
For examples , CO2 and SO2 .
According to the increase of voice in `` earth saving '' , people will most transported by public-vehicles .
For example , they will transport by railway instead of dissel-cars .

Thirdly , for the development of the tele-communication , citizen may not need to go out for works .
They may work at home .
They may go shopping at home .
The student may not goto school , their class may be held at home .
Do anything at home .
So the needs of the cars will be decrease .

On the other hand , the population of many countries is decreasing .
So that , after 20-years , the needs of cars may decrease .
Otherways , the working groups of citizen also need to spend money for the eldery .

Next , the capacity of cars are increasing day-to-day .
They may carry more people and goods .
That will decrease the numbers of the cars .
For examples , 60 years ago , there was no double-desker-bus in the world .
Nowadays , the road is full of double-desker-bus .
The development of the technologies can decrease the demand of the cars .

According to the reasons I mentions above , I think that there will be fewer cars in use .
Perhaps after 20 years , people will be travelling on foot for heathy life !
