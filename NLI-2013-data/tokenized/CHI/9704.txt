The ideas of taking risks is not only highly important to the well-being for a common person but also become a signifaciant step to success .
So I am highly convinced that a sucessful people need try new things rather than only doing aleady know .

Firstly , taking risk can make a man try different area , so he can know more knoeledge than a common man .
For one thing , knowing more can takes a man staying in the right position which lets him be brave to face everything .
For another , more knowledge is a good tool to do everything cellent and bring him to success .

For the second reason , taking risk is a wise way to make more friends , a man can develop his interpersonal skills via meeting more friends .
Only doing in the already knowing way , however , reduce the chance to see more people , which makes a negative impact on one 's communicating skills that plays an important part on finding jobs , doing teamwork and talking with others .
appearntly , taking risk does make a good infuluence on the successful people .

Last but not least , successful people should try new things to find what the disadvantage is

In a final analysis , we can draw an brief view that taking risk is a good way to develop one ability .
So successful people should try new things more than doing what already knowhow to do .
