People respond differently to the issue of `` do advertisements mislead people 's feeling on the products ?
Some may say that advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
However , the opponents argues that advertisements only make peopole to realise the products themselves .
In my opinion , I argue for the former statement for following reasons .

First of all , the purpose of an advertisement is to increase the sale .
In this case , it is very likely that an advertisement was exaggurated by people who want to increase the sale .
For example , if a man is responsible for the sale of one medicine .
To accomplish his goal , he might need to bolster the effectiveness that the medicine will bring .
To some degree , the medicine may not as effective as he describes , but this bolster may increase the sale .

Second , one important elements of advertising is being attractive .
Since people will not notice a prasic advertisement , it is important to make an advertisement as attractive as possible .
Take newspapers for instance .
Editors of newspapers usually use and enlarge certain attractive phrases and minimize relatively less attractive words .
The purpose of doing this is to make people curious to their articles .
However , this behavior involves in certain degree of exagguration .

Lastly , another purpose of advertising is to promote the products .
To fulfill this goal , certain degrees of exagguration may be involved .

In all , according to aforementioned reasons , I conclude that most advertisements do exaggurate the porducts because the purpose of advertising is to increase the sale of the products .
Moreover , advertisements need to be attractive , so that the purpose can be made .
And if the medicine does not work as effective as he describes
