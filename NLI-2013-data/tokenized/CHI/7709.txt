There are two common ways to travel now .
One is travelling in a group led by a tour guid ; the other one is going by oneself .
They both have their own advantages .
The choice might depend on travelers ' own abilities and personalities .

I know travelling with a group and a tour guide has been mostly accepted by people .
People who chose this way are likely travel to the places with long historical or curtural back ground like China Europe without the knowledge about them , so they need a guide .
They may have no special needs such as the diet of food , the room condiction , the schedule of planing or staying at one place they most like for more time .
Moreover , traveling with a group will help people , especially lazy ones , to get rid of booking the hotel , finding some where to have meal or even which place they should go .

Compare with the way above , as a person with more personalities and needs , I reather to travel by myself or with my best friends .
Firstly , I think the most interesting step of a whole journey is not staying at the place you travel to but the process of planning for the whole trip .
Imagine that you can sit arround a table with hot coffe , think of how lovely the period of the trip will be and discuss or argue with your friend about where you guys should go .
That 's very attractive to me .
Secondly , I love natural views more than historical buildings , so I can totally go to a place that does n't need be far , dones n't need a guide there or even does n't have a name .
I can enjoy the view and take picture of that , and share thatwith my friends .
I can stay as long as I wish to and go anywhere I like for my next station .
Without feeling hurry , without feeling being contraled , the two words in my mind are relaxation and freedom .
That is the meaning of travel , is n't it ?
