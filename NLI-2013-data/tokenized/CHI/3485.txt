People respond to this issue differently .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities .
As a young girl , I do n't think that I can give enough time to help my community .
Here comes some reasons .

First of all , young people nowadays have more vivid personalities than decades ago .
In this situation , young people try their best to be themselves and do everything they want to do .
So they may have fewer time and may be unwilling to helping their communities just because they think it is stupid or rediculous if they help thier communuties .
In other words , they think that helping their communitis is not the thing that a young man should do .
For example , young people in my country indicates that young people should go outside and try something new and exciting , not just stay at home or in communities .
Participating activities of communities is the thing that old people do .
Although this may not be a correct idea , it really influence you

In addition , as advanced technology is invented and applied , there are more and more activities that young people can do .
But we only have 24 hours a day and it led to a fewer time to hepling our communities in contrast .
For example , we can go see a movie or go riding , go kloofing , or even attand to a big computer game competition .
There are too many things for we young people to try and to experience .
That is , we can hardly get eough time helping our communities because there are more and more interesting and exciting activities that appeal to us .

To summarize , young nowadays really do n't give enough time to help their communities .
But this does n't mean that we do n't love our own community , afterall , there are too many things enchant us .
We have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to us and this may help us to learn more and experience mor from it .
