I don not think the statement will come true in decades .
Nowadays private cars are more popular than ever .
There is a trend for more cars in the future .

Many peole might think the cars have many disadvantages and will be fewer in years .
They think if everyone is driving a car , the traffic will be in a jam , the air will be heavily polluted , and the expense on car maintainence and petrol fee will be large .
These are problems , but have these peolpe ever thought new environment - freindly feul will lighten the pollution ?
Have they ever thought the road condition will improve steadly in years with the billions of dollars the government given annually ?

So these problems can be solved soomthly , and further there are more exciting advantages of owning a private car .
First , the private car will do bring a unmatched convenience while compared to other public traffics ( subway , commute ) .
Just Imagine , with your own car you can go wherever you want to in holidays and vacations .
What a fascinating experience you are going to enjoy !
Second , more that convenience , a car can provide something beyond physical .
For instance , if you are successful man in society and you are driving your fancy car in road , you will be admired by others because of your nice car .
According to psychologist being admired is vital to a person , because it can help you to get confidence in society .
So based on these reasons , the car number wo n't decrease in decades .
Last it is safe when you use the private car than public traffic , you wo n't be stolen or robbed in your own car .

If we can bear the crowdness in buses and subways , if we have enough time to waste in buses before they get to offices or schools , if we will never be robbed in midnight subways , we agree the private cars will decrease because we can use public traffic instead of private cars .
But we ca n't , so cars wo n't decrease in years .
