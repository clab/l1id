I agree with the best way to trave is in a group led by a tour guide .
If we go to trave , to trave in a group and the group have a tour guide is the best .
Firstly , if we go to travel with a group and a tour guide , the travel will be very successful .
The tour can introduce many informations about the place where we travel and we can know many specific things that we never listend .
we also can decrease many proplems if we have a tour guide , for example , we will go the wrong ways if we go alone , and we perhaps miss many beautiful sence .
Next , the tour guide can help us find nice and cheap restaurant , thus , we will not waste much money .
The tour guide can take us to eat some delicious food and watch beautiful sence , possible , we will listen nice story from the tour guide .
Finally , to trave with a group and tour guide is very save .
one person often have some proplems that he and she can not slove .
If we travel together , we can solve many problems that happen during the travel , travers can help each other carefully .
Also , traving with a group that have a tour guide will be more happy , for example , the group can hold many good games and they will play together , they also can make friends .

In summary , to travell with a group and a tour guide is very intersering , It is the best way to travel .
