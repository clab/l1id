In twenty years there wull be fewer cars in use tjan there are today .
As far as I am concerned .
I disagree with the statement because I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is a good .
The cars is a important in we life .
We used cars is many years .
Cars give we have a quitly .

First of all the many people have a car , and many people have naad car go to doing everything .
For example we have by car take to a trip .
Moreover the car can give we go to diffirence trip .
Give we have have a good trip funny
.

In addition the porson have a car .
Theyself can have a time .
Everytime go to there is Ok .
For instance many porson go to school they can weting the bus .
Furthermore have a car not weting the bus .
Weting the bus is hot so good .

In summary I think have a cars have a good time give myself .
I can go to everything .
Go to a trip with my perence togater .
Furthermore have a car not weight bus .
SO I disagree with the statemant In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
