I disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In this essay I will state the reasons why I am against this idea .

More often than not , people choose to travel in a goup led by a tour guide because they are either not familiar with the place where they are trvaeling or not familiar with the langauage .
Therefore , they are afraid of having trouble and have no way to ask for help .
With the advanced technology , it cannot be easier to find information about the place you plan to visit .
You can book air tickets and hotels and rent cars online .
You can download maps of the cities you are visiting and carry them with you so that you are less likely to get lost .
As for the language problem , with more and more people traveling around the world , local people more or less learn to speak several languages relating to their main sources of tourism .
Moreover , how much language will be required to travel a place ?
Not much , I think .
When you are doing sightseeing , you do not talk .
When you are shopping , you just need to know the price and you just simply look at price tags .
When you are ordering food , you just need to know what is on the menu .
Even though you cannot read , there are always pictures .

I prefer to travel with friends without a tour guide .
I enjoy more freedom by doing so .
There is no tight schedule to meet .
Plans are always flexible .
Most important of all , I am not always in a rush .
I can stay in a place as long as I wish .
By traveling alone or with friends , I have more opportunities to experience local culture and to observe the way local people live .
I am not in a hurry to run from this place to another .
When I find something interesting , I can stay longer to find out more .
This in turn contributes more to my memory than just storming from place to place taking pictures .

To sum up , traveling by oneself not with a group benefits travelers more .
Even though there might be more preparation work to do before setting out , you learn and gain more after coming back from the trip .
In my points of view , people learn to be independent by traveling alone to a foreign country .
Taking myself as an example , I always travels alone and I find myself grow up a bit after every trip .
