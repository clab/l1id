Here are some of funny things now .
Some one think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Others do not support it .
In the following , here gives my own opinions about the topic .

Obviously , it is a hard question to speak .
In my opinion , it all depands .
Yonug people are always energetic .
Enjoy life to them is do playing .
They can do mang cool things that the older can not take , such as playing tense games , travelling to many beautiful palces away from hometown .
In short , they have the ability to take part in physical working things , which is not available to the older .

Now , whether the older is not enjoy the life ?
The key makes sure that is wrong .
Compare with young 's energy , the older would not have any advantages .
Though thus , fortunately , there is one thing that the young must have not : the memory .
In the older 's childhoods , lacking of morden instruments , there is no computers , no colorful tv sets , no abundant money to live a good life , even no money to live .
All that they experienced is rather uneasy .
It must be the most important memory in their whole life .
Now living in the peaceful and rich life , both can not image when they were child , come to be the turth .

Finally , here is an example .
My grandma , grangpa , father , mother , sisterand me together to chat with each others .
In god we trust , this is the most wonderful memory in my opinions that we are happy to talk .
Ilove my country , my parents , my friends , many thing i want is just we can be together , then make a good lie to our no matter what happen untill we aer die .
That is all .
Thank you .
