Given the choice between agree or disagree with that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities , will we agree or disagree ?
It is considered that the answer is positive .
However , I totally disagree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities now .
The reasons are presented as follow : First , lots of young people care about other people much , it maybe their friends , neithberhood , or even some people they do not know .
For example , several weeks ago , it had a new on television said that a elementary school student saved his own allowance to help his neithbor , two little brother and sister , because their parents left them alone in the house for three days .

Second , lots of young people join the communitity helping club at school .
At school , we can see many students join the helping communitities club , because they want to help more people who need help .

Third , lots of you people worry about the environment , so they do the recycle things , and it is helpful to the communities .
To sum up , lots of young people are caring about people who lives in their live , joining the helping communities club to help someone they need help , worring about the environment to be clean .
Therefore , I totally disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
