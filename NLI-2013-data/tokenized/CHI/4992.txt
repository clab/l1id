Advertisement is now regarded as one of the greatest industries in the twenty first century .
The foundamental philosophies of advertisements are obvious-to create a better impression of the product the advertisement is describing in the minds of potential customers .
As communication technologies and psychology theories advanced considerably over the last century , the effects and power of the advertisements outfitted with high sophisticated computer generized amazing visual scenes and sound effects , grew more and more powerful in convincing the customers that `` this '' product is wonderful , inpeccable , to a extent often exceeds the reality !

Even about ten years ago , this unbelievable strength of advertisement had emerged for a long time .
I remember that when I was a child in elementary school ( probably the second grade ) , I was fascinated with the afternoon advertisement of the Little Sun beverage .
The TV advertisement created a false image that the bottle of the soda , which , of course delicately decorated with wings , could really fly , and a lot of children could follow it and find a mysterious land in which they could enjoy playing there with catoon stars .
However , when I got this bottle as my birthday gift , I was disillusionised that it is JUST a toy , not a creature of any kind .
Therefore , I hereby denounce the tricks employed in the advertisements that beautify products inproperly .

Moreover , we can see the capacity of advertisement to exaggarate the merits of the products by discussing the process of the advertisement creation .
First , a market survey is conducted , in which the subconscious desires of people are analysed and taken advantage of .
For example , the common illnesses are severe impediment for people who travel around all the time , so the advertisers know that if they could trigger the travelers subconcious fear of getting sick during their trips by citing a example in which a officer is assigned an extremely crucial job oversea , and any delay can cause a dreadful lose of his firm 's profit .
In this case , a illness can be a so terrible happening that the person want to avoid desperately , and now , a tricky advertiser can manipulate the story .
He can say that by taking a kind of medicine , the traveler avoided a disease which would bother him if he had n't eat the pills .
Thereby , by constructing this plot , it seemed that the pill worth a lot , because `` without this pill , the company would lose a hundred million because the man taking responsibility would be impeded by severely illness '' , However , this impression is false and a pill is just a pill not comparable to a million dollars , but learned advertisers can link a pill with a hundred million dollars in the mind of the consumers subconsciously .
As a result , the advertisment created a image that the pill which in fact worth only a cent can be as valuable as a million dollars , which is horribly better than the pill itself !
Second , the visual image produced by highly developed computer technologies entitle the advertisements to penetrate the watchers ' defenses .
When we watch a advertisement , we conduct a analysis of how valuable this product is by using our past experiences and knowledges .
However , those grandiose images can easily confuse our mind and hinder our ability to reason effectively .
Therefore , by obstruct of own capacity of define how good a product is for ourselves , the advertisement actually confuses us and gives us a false image about the products , and the advertisers have no motivation to create the false image inferior than the reality .
