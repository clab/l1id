Some people say that successful person will not be willing to do what they know already but try new things out .
I strongly agree this statement , and I have reasons for my this .

People sometimes talk about this line `` a hero is someone who is doing a common thing in a not common way '' What makes a people successful is that he/she make a defference in something .
If the person just follow the rule already there and does the thing what they already know , how can he/she be different ?
How can he/she be special ?

For people already succeeded .
In order to survive among all those succeful people , They always choose to try new things to make them more successful .
Like most scientist , they could spend their whole life time in lab for researching , discouvering a new effcient way to make something instead of what we are using now .

In fact , the public recognize those peope who invent new things or discover something new which are very useful for people .
The gorverment rise scholoship , the universities provide fellowship , many company and organization give money for people do research as well .
A successful people will not refuse to take the risk to become for successful and make a defferent with those help .

All in all , my conclusion is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do , however , what they are going to do is completely based on what we already know , knowledge is the rule .
