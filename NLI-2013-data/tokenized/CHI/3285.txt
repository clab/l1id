Nowadays , young people could get much more information than before .
Sometimes , they got too much information and too much things have to do or read , cause them have to spend their time staying at home or working .
Young people have no time to help their communities because of their busy and irresponsibility .

First , young people will force to study and learn other skills such as playing piano or guitar .
They have to spend their time in classes over eight hours in a day .
That means , they lost their leisure time to be together with their communities .
They do n't have any chance to know what happened to their communities and also do n't know how to help them .
Young people lacked of time to care about their communities because they even do n't have to time to prepare their works .

Second , young people are not so responsible as the old people .
For the traditonal custom , old people will consider communities as an important role for them .
In spite of they are busy , they will spend their time in communities and try to help or slove any problems .
However , young people were spoiled by their parents for a long time that made them locked of responsibility .
Young people did n't take this duty as regarded .
They do n't care about others except themselves .
They are rather staying at home than going out even thought the communities are outside .

Young people for nowadays have different thoughts .
They are too self-esteemed and selfish which cause them not to care about their communities .
They might have some times can help or do something for their communities .
Howere , they hate to do these because they do n't want to get any troubles in case .
They also do n't want to argue with their neighbors while they have their own opinions .
As time changed , young people dislike to help their communities .
