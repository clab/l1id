Glance through a piece of newspapers and you will in all likelikhood see news concerned with the future trends of such careers as accountants , lawyers , doctors , and so on .
There has long been a controversy about whether a person coped with broad knowledge will be superior to the one with only specialized knowledge in one academic aspect .
Actually , this is an issue regarding to the `` width '' and `` depth '' of knowledge acquired .
To me , however , I contend that it is the depth of the knowledge that prevail .
This argument can be ascribed to the following rationales .

To commence with , acquiring specialized knowledge can have a person comprehensively and deeply understand the academic subject specialized .
True , someone may claim that a person should receive general education to be comprehensive for knowledge .
However , imagine if a person acquire all breeds of knowledge in different aspects but without further deep understanding of them .
Do you think if he really understands the core knowledge of every aspects ?
In contrast , a person acquiring a specialized knowledge in his education can let him stand out among others .
And a specialized person can receive general knowledge through reading books and newspapers .

Second , from a career perspective , possessing specialized knowledge can serve as an entry barrier for the industry that requires the specific knowledge .
A vivid example of this is the accounting industry .
To successfully become an accountant or auditor , one must have possessed much expertise pertaining to accouting standards and rules .
How can a person who has much knowledge in the sense of width but without the depth compete for the job ?
So it is undeniably true that having specialized knowledge can render a person competent enough for his career .

Last but by no means least , viewed from a macroeconomic sense , having people specializing knowledge in various academic subjects can serve as a divison of labor of an economy .
When people in an economy posseess different kinds of expertise , comparative advantages are thus created and the economy can have a pool of talents on different aspects .
To further support this point , think of an extreme situation when an unprecedentedly new leathal disease is spread out in a country .
If everyone does have a knowledge broadly but witout depth , who can help tackling the problem which require strong knowledge in , for example , bio-chemistry ?

In recapitulation , a person possessing specialized knowledge can be benefical for both individuals and the society .
I , therefore , stand against the statement in the question .
