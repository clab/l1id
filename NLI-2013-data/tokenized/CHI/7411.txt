The statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' is mostly received by travellars today .
I agree with this statement too and I will prove may opinion for several aspects in the following .

Firstly , as the rapid development of economy and society , efficient is much more important than before .
So people must plan a detailed schedual for traveling .
This will be waste much time for the people who have plenty of works and less chances of holidays .
In this condition , traveling of led by a tour guide could save time and energy for people .

Secondly , the tour guide will make a perfect plan for the travellars .
The guide with abundant experiences of traveling and full of knowledge about the tour place , he or she could supply a good service for tourists .
Therefore , tourists need not to consider anything about the detailed project of travelling .

Thirdly , there are many uncontrollable conditions and environments in the traveling place .
Tourists who are lack of the experience are easy to be defected .
For example , many people who travels did not in a group have the experiences that they may waste plenty of time in seeking for the traveling place and buses to the places , or they will be suggested to buy many expensive and useless things in the travel places .

Lastly , group traveling could make people feel warm and safe .
People who travel as a single may feel lonely .
The travels in the group could share with the excellent experiences about the traveling and when face to some problems , they could discuss them together and reach to a solution about the problems .

In conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide may be a good choice for traveling and take a unique experience to the travellars .
