Do you agree this statement that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' ?
As far as I am concerned , I think that the individual travel is another better choice than travelling in a group with a tour guide .
In addition , I will provide the reasons in the following to support my opinion .

First of all , I argue that if someone travel alone , he / she could have more surprising and interesting experiences that can not happen in group travelling and posses the more unforgettable memories during the trip .
For example , my friend , she traveled in the US few years ago .
she told me that she went to a small town then lost her all money .
However , a kind person borrow her money and let my friend to live .
Therefore , she also had a gread time .

Secondly , I consider that we can learn how to be independent and settle the troubles that encounter accidently when person travel without a tour guide .

To summerize , I believe that individual travelling is not only a good oppotunity to experience the different and interesting way of travel , but also could train us to become an independent person and learn more .
In the ending , I will conclude my argument by emphasizing on individual travel is good way to have experiencesand to learn something .
Trying to travel alone .
