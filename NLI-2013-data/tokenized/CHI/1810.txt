There are a lot of people who think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinoin , I totally agree with this statement because the young have a more healthier body , also the world is new to them .

We can not deny that the young have more healthier bodies which make they can enjoy their life much better .
Nowadays there are many activities and sports for people to relax themselves such as the hiking , swimming .
But these activities and sports have something in common , a good body .
For example , the hiking request people being strong and full of energy .
Even some young are not dare to try the hiking , so how could the older people ?

Moreover , now many travels is not permitted to the people who have the heart diseases .
As we know , it is a common diseases among the older .
For example , once my family decided to go to Tibetan to have a journey , Unforturenatly my grand-father was not allowed to go there because of his heart diseases .

Many young people are curious to the new field than older people .
Because the whole world seems to be new to him .
There are a lot of food or sceneries they have never experienced before .
But as to the older people , they are always stubborn and they do not listen to others ' advices .
When I asked my father to go to seaside , he always responced me that he was not willing to go .
Because in his mind , the sea is no different although it is in the different areas and going to seaside would not appear him any more .
But the young people never have this feeling .

All in all , from the reasons and example given above , we can easily draw the conclusion the young people enjoy life than older people do .
