In our daily life , more and more entermaint place comes up , most of them are for young people .
So there is a debate also coming up we have to face .
Young people enjoy life more than older people do , is it true ?
I have answer already .

In fact , when a youny adult and an old man choise the way to enjoy their lives , there is something different between them .
The young people have enough energy to play , and even more some sports games with risks , like skatting .
It is a pity that old people have not such energy to play crazily as the same as young adults .
They can not drink too much because their livers are easily hurt by alchol than young guys .
What 's more , in many aspects , old men are not able to enjoy like young ones .

I believed , when many people were young , some gamble things often happened in our life .
With the time flying , less and less risks would be taken when we are becoming older .
I think the reason why that can happen is that the passion is lost with the ages .
I think sometimes , the gamble things can bring us more passion and more happiness .
Unforturnetly , the old people does not think so .
They think safety is more important than anything , which makes things faint .

In morden today , more and more entertamant place are designed for young people .
why ?
Because the wise companies catch the chance to attract young people , not older people , which represents young people can bring more economic development for the society than older people .
That 's also why young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are abound life for young guys .

In a word , I agree about that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Whatever any aspects , young guys can feel more happiness than older ones as the result of having a more younger heart .
