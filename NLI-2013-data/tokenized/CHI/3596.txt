It is of my opinion that helping communities is quite important for me .
With the concerning of the young people may not have enough time to devote themselves to helping their communites , I have several reasons and solutions as the followings

First , young people are energetic than the elders , they spend a lot of time in studying as well as playing .
They learn all the time and have the will to learn .
If they are asked to manage things with their neighbors , they will not refuse and hesitate to do .
In this prime time , young people like to help with each other to solve the problem .

Next to go would be , the definition of the communities may not simply mean the surroundings they live .
It can also be inferred the place they study and work .
Young people like to join clubs and learn something new in order to satisfy the thirst toward knowledge .
They concentrate with a specific field and lauch their efforts to achieve their ideal goal .
All these accomplishments need time and thier endeavor .

Moreover , they learn in helping .
Such as decorating a club center , recruiting new blood to the club , and even taking care of the sick classmate or neighbor preoccupied with business .

However , though they are so active in their community affair , there definitely are blind spots that they probably fail to focus on .
For example , young people who live outside may encounter the gap between them and their family .
For example , when I was an undergraduate who live far away from family , being not able to go home per week makes some communicational problems with my family members .

As a whole , young people do have enough time to helping thier communities .
