Some people may believe that there will be more car in use in futhre , but I disagree .
I ca n't imagine that there have enough space and streets can be used for more cars .

First because the traffic jam are more and more common in nowadays .
So many cars in our country can not be used efficently because there are lots of traffic jams in every street at early moning 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 .
In work hours , I only need to spent 20 minutes to get school from my appartment , but it 's taken nearly 90minutes in rush hours .
It 's a waste of time .
A lot of friends of mine told me that , they would not going to buy any car because ther is n't enough roads can be use for solve the traffic problem .

Second , there are more and more pollutions made by cars .
When I was 6 , I could always see lots of stars in every evening sky .
But I can not see them recently , becanse the pollutions are to heavy to cover the sky .
The smokes that seeked by the cars are making a lot of pullutions in the air .
And it 's seemed so harmful to our heathy .

Third , the price of the oil incressed a lot , that made many people did n't want to buy a car .
I alwanys saw so many cars only parked in the parking space that are did n't drive in .
And when I asked a owner why he did n't drive his car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive his car for 2 years can buy another car .
That seems like we must spend as much or more mony we buy the car to buy the oil .

Taken the above reasons into account , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .
Not only more cars mean more spaces will be taken , also means few pollutions and lots bebefits for our heathy .
