Nowadays , there are numerous debates about the issue whether or not the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Some people hold that travelling individually is better .
Others , however , contradict it .
From my point of view , I firmly agree that travelling in a group is the best way for the following reasons .

To stand with , travelling in a group will be much safer .
In other words , if people have a trip with other people , they will feel much safer .
A survey in the Toronto Star talks about that travelling individually will be more dangerous than travelling in a gruop .
For instance , when I am travelling in a group , if I have any problems or dangerous , the members who are in my tour group will help me out from the problems .
Therefore , travelling in a group will make people feel much safer .

In addition , travelling in a group will make people spend less money .
That is , people will spend less money in travelling in a group than travelling solely .
The reason is that the tour company will have so many discounts about the hotels , the restaurants and the entry to famous places .
A person who is travelling in a group , for example , visits to China just need to spend $ 400 , while anther person who is travelling individually should spend $ 800 .
Hence , travelling in a group will be cheaper .

Finally , travelling in a group will make you visit more places .
In other words , when you are travelling in a group , you will have a chance to visit considerable more places .
You will be a stranger when you travel to that place , so you wo n't know which places are worth for you to visit .
If you join the group when you are travelling , you will visit dramatically more places .
Consequently , travelling in a group will make people have a chance to visit more famouse and beautiful places .

Based on what I have discussed , it is self-evidence that travelling in a group is beneficial for people .
Travelling in a group will not only make people feel much safer , but also let people spend less money and have a chance to visit more places as well .
