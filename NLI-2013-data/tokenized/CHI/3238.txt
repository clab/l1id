A lot of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because thay think that they always have a full timetable .
I totally disagree with this statement for two reasons .

First of all , most young people do not help their communities , because they want to avoid the dirty tesk .
For example , there is a park near my house .
when I was a child , my friend and I always went to the park to pick up the litters after school .
But nowadays most young people thinks that kind of tesk should belong the pedastrian servents .

secondly , most young people spend a lot of time playing the computer games and watching television , so they say that thay do not have time .
But in the past .
when young people did not have such a variety of recreations , the young people usually did a lot of community services .
For example , my mother has gone to the hospital near her house to be a volunteer for nearly thirty years .
Thus , the excuse that the young people say that they do not have time is just an another excuse of unwilling .

Some people may disagree with my pionts , claiming that the young people indeed have other things to pursue , like the job competition , the pressure of school work .
However , I still consider that the young people can squeeze a little time to help their communities .
