Successful people try news thnhgs .
It is not the bad idea .
I think people should learn new thing every day .
It is fun to learn new thnigs .
And when you learning new things you can know what is things you good at and do better than another people .

But if you already know how to well on one things .
Another people are know well to do anothert things .
That you do n't need to woried about when you try to do another thing you will make mistake .
Because you can just toled the people is good at do for you and you can do the things you good at for him .
For example today there is a complian .
There are three people are going to make chairs .
There is A who can cut the trees faster than everyone .
B is who can use one tree two make two chairs .
And C is who sells cahirs faster than everyone .
So if today you are a boos what are you going to do ?
To make each one to leant how to cut the tres like A , make chairs like B or sells chairs like C. But that will be westing to much time and money .
And it problem will not make the good chairs .

So I think if there is one person he is good at something already and you shoul keep him to do the same thing .
And another peopl do what is they good at .
If you do n't know waht is you good at you can try new things untial you find out waht is you good at .
So successful people try new thingd and rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .
This will be work .
This waht happen in the world now and to becane more propucally .
