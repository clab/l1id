I totally agree with the statement about the young people nowadays .
The reason why I think so is because I actually see this phenomenom , young people are spending all the time on their own selfs and seldom cares about thier own communities .
After school , most people would ask to play around out side , seldom of them might think of there own communities , like their communities have nothing to do with them , it 's only a place where offers your commodation .

But I 'm not like them other guys , I think that making our efforts to help our communities is so important .
In my opinion , the atmosphere of the communiy you live will directly affects your minds , moods and behaviors .
We all know that people could be affected by their surrounding evironments so easily .
In one of my class , a teacher told us to concern about our own communities , do our best to help our communities to go better , and he would constantly asking us if we are doing the right thing !
I feel this is so good for us to establish our conscience in our own place .

Everyone is responsible for their communities , because those are n't your private area , I think everyone should collaborate together to help thier communities , in order to make their ownselfs a better living .
As the proverb goes `` All birds flock together . ''
It reveals that if you are making efforts tohelp your own community , others will start to contact you and do it with you , this really helps a lot .
In a nutshell , I think that we should start to educate our own offsprings to know how important it is to help our own communities , only a little people is not enough , we should promote it as a civic activity , live begins at our own communities , with more help , there is a better tomorrow .
