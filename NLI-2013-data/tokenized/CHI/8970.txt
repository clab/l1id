For students , they should understand ideas and concepts in class for getting good marks on their tests or some important exams , at the same time , they should learn facts in their lives as well .
Actually it is not easy to tell which one is more important , as both of them are essential elements in life .
However , I prefer to choose learn more facts for the life , because you will not always stay at school as a student , but you will need to know facts for dealing with your life forever .

Nowadays , more and more parents want their children get higher education , as it not only helps them to get a good job in the future , but also helps them to know how to use proper ways to deal with life problems .
In China , students are learning so hard that sometimes they just cannot get enough sleep .
I will not say it is a wrong way to guide students , I just a kind of worrying about what is the students and their parents really want ?
Just understand ideas and concepts in textbooks , and then get good marks ?
No , they do n't .
Anyway , some examples already make people think about this problem .
A friend of mine told me a story about a tipically `` good '' student .

Ming is the best student in his school , and his parents , all his teachers and classmates are proud of him very much , as he always gets near perfect on his tests ...
It means he understands ideas and concepts of textbooks very well .
Once , he got like 96 % on a exam , and one of his friend beated him as 97 % , he was so crazy about it that he hurt himself using a knife .
I just cannot believe that , can we say Ming is a perfect student ?
No , he is n't .
He should know he cannot always be the best one in the school , and he should accept fact that others will be better than him .
Another thing is he should learn to make good friends and share his talents and life experiences with them .

Maybe you will say this example is extreamel , actually , when your parents and other people around you require you too much , you will feel so stressful and upset that you even cannot do anything , at this time , you need to know more facts to face it , like how to deal with stress , how to stop people around you require you too much , and how to enjoy the life .
For example , we should know one fact , which is a person living in a world , we should be educated for sure , on the other hand , we need keep our hobbies , and share our joy with people we love as well .

For me , school is not the most important thing , I would like to learn more facts in the life , that are more interesting !
