When we look from the past to nowadays , we would discover a lot of successful people .
These people had mostly pay a lot of time trying new stuffs and experienced new things , and that is why these people can succeed .
Therefore , a lot of time , it is true that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than onlly doing what they already know how to do well .

People who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well often succed .
These people often work really hard to find new stuffs and new ideas .
People who wants to succeed oftne need to take risks in order to succeed .
Although they might not end up liveing with good respects or beliefs from other people , their successes are undoubtable .
For instance , one of the famous scientist who had exclaimed that earth is round ended up by putting in to jail for a while , but his successful career is now no doubt that his theory was right .
Therefore , people who are able to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know what to do well often succeed .

On the other hand , people who do not try new things and take risks but only doing what they already know how to do well do not often succeed .
If a person do not try new things and discover new things , one would only be a professional in one 's field .
Meanwhile , that person would be a really tiny chance to find new things like those who succeed .
For example , if a smart student is good at science but he does not try to find any new thing in science , he might only be a good teacher or professor in his field , but instead of being a successful people who find new things .
Hence , it is clear that people who do not try new things and take risks would probably end up being profession but not succeed in finding new stuff .

Successful people often try new things and take risks to accomplish their goal rather than doing what they know how to do well .
We should learn good characteristics from these successful people , and trying to do our best .
Hopefully , one day we would become those successful people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
