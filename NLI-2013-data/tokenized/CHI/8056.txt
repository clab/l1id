When it comes to the questions of whether it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for the students to learn facts , different people might have totally different answers to the question .
In my view , it is more important for the students to learn facts .
The reasons go as fellows .

First of all , the facts are about experience .
To learn the facts can make the study more practical .
Considering that if a student just learn the idea and the concepts in his or her study , he or she just know what it is because the concept told him or her .
However , he or she may not understand how to use it or what it is for to learn such thing .
The problem is that they did not related the idea and concept to facts .
They should learn to analysis facts use the learning of concepts , making their study more practical .

In addition , it is more usefl for the students to learn facts .
As we know , the purpose for people to study ideas and concepts is to use it and make contribution to our lives .
Our lives consist many of facts , and we need to study the facts and make them useful to us .
If we just study ideas and concepts , it means nothing to our scociety .
The ideas and concepts are just the basis of facts .

It is ture that we need to learn the ideas and concepts first and then we can learn and understand the facts better .
It is also true that leaning ideas and concepts is the basis thing for us to practice our knowledge .
I also admit that ideas and concepts play important role in human study .
However , in comparision with the importance to fianlly get used to our lives , facts is more important .

In conclusion , based on the resons I discussed above , even though others may have totally different opinoins with me , i still belive that facts is more important .
