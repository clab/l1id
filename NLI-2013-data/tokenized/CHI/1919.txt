In the morden world , people always work so hard for their life , unusaly they forget to enjoy their life .
There are bring a question tha if young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
There are some people think that the older people are more enjoy the young people , the main reanson is that older people have enough time to enjoy their life .
In my opinion , in fact that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The reasons are below .

There maybe one or two advantages of the old people enjoy life more than young people .
For instance , that when a person became old , they did n't spend so many time on work , stay themselves to live in the world .
They have their son to gave their enough money to eat and drink , they only thing need to do is that to enjoy their own life .
But young people must spend their time to work , study , and so on .
They have so many things to do , lead to do n't have time to enjoy their life .

Alao , I agree that the time is limet the young people to enjoy their life , but constrant the advantages , this will became not improtant .
The young people have some many typies ways for them to enjoy their life , in the morden world , there are have different choices for young people to play .
For instance , that when after the whole day 's work or in the weekend , they can play football , basketball , and the other sports .
There are not only goof for their body keep heath but also can make themselves relax .
On the other hand , they could paly computer games with each other .
Not only of this , there have many other choice like sing song , dance , and so on .
But these thing seem to hard for old people , they move so hardly , and do n't have health body to play this thing like sports .
They main way is to stay home watch TV or talk wtih somebody .

The other advantage of young people enjoy life is that they have good health to enjoy their life .
One person if do n't have good health that means so many things they could lost .

There are is why i think young people enj
