When we come out the ideas we can creat the ideas and and the concepts .
Since that we must care about the facts .
As far as I am concerned , I am strongly disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lean facts .

First of all , in real life , facts include many unfornseen troubles .
The diffical facts will become valuable experience .
They will tell us how to do it and what we need to do .
The hard facts will allow us to endure hard times in the future .
It also provide many information for us to think deeper and more close to the real life .

Secondly , facts is very important in the real life .
Even you can realated the ideas and the concepts , you can think that as well as you can , you still need to care about the facts .
If the facts in the real life did n't work very well .
No matter the ideas and the concepts is well , the facts also play an important part in the real life .

Third , facts state the important position between the ideas and the concepts .
The facts can let the ideas and the concepts go through fluquently .
Without the facts , all the ideas and the concepts is empty .
The facts will let people think deeper and more comprehensive .
It provide a broader range for for people to explore it by themselves .

All in all , I strongly state that for people to learn facts is more important for them to learn or understant ideas and the concepts .
Facts is so important that it play an very important position in the real life .
It connect the ideas and the concepts to make it into real .
