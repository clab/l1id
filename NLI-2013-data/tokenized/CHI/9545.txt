I agree successful people love to try new things and take risks rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .
there are few reasons that i support .

First , I think to be a successful person whose personality must be interest in anything .
They like ti take adventatures and to do a lot of new things that are general people do n't want to do it .
For example .
my father is a successful businessman .
He was born in a very small town in Taiwan .
In his family , there are no body want to go to big city to find a job .
Everyone is satisified with their life , thay do n't want to change their life styles .
Even thought they know to stay in the country ca n't be rich , but they still love to stay in the country .
My father is different with other people .
He knows if he work hard and know more about information from world , it must be help to his future and career .
Whatever how hard work , he always wants to try and he never afraid of challanges .
Because he knows that may be a good chance to change his life .
And now he did it .

Second , I think if you never try new things , you wo n't know how will be change in your world .
If you want a successful life , you have to try everything .
To find every possible successful reason and do n't be afraid of to make mistakes .
Because any mistakes can make you find out what 's problem in this situation and improve your ability .

I believe to be a successful person needs to spend more time to do a lot of things and it must have a hard time to overcome .
But one day when you become a successful person , you will know everything is worth .
