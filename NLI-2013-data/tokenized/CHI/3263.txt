Living in a modern and high-paced society , with the gaining severity of competitions and the emphasis on personal achievements , people seem to have less concern on others .
With the changing of the living style , a community seems to have lost its previous function of holding every member together for people are more involved in personal activities .
And all these changes affect on the younger generation .
However , there seem to be a initiation of change in this minimizing time devotion to the community by young people .

The lost of devotion in the community has long been concerned by observers and scholars , thus , certain modifications are made in the educational system , such as that in the National Taiwan University which I am currently attending .
A special program is designed , aiming for students to provide services to the community .
This program is conducted by the advisors , and every univesity students would have to complete at least three semesters of services in order to graduate .
This serves as a response to the insufficent concern given by the young generation and is expecting the students to be inspired by this experience .

In the last semester , our advisor design a special service activity for our class .
By cooperating with a well-known organization which provides help to the homeless , the elderly , and the people who are suffering from brain damage , my classmates and I were able to provide services to these minorities of the society .
After a official training course , we helped the patients to bath , talked with the elder people who lived alone , and helped the organization to hold activities during special occasions like the mother 's day .
In participation , we were able to discover that not only us , but many younger students from junior high schools were seen helping in the organization , along with lots of volunteers .
I personally bathed a patient under the professional assistance of the students from nursery school .
Seeing all these young people , as old as or even younger than my age , devoting their time helping others deeply moved me .

We were asked to write reports according to the services , and the responds where enthusiatic .
One of the reports even appeared on the school news paper .
Further cooperation is established , and is expected to rouse more response among these once `` unconcerned '' young people .

Under the tutoring and properly designed program , the young people , who are once closing in the small academic world , are able to reach out their arms and to embrace the others - within the community , and hopefully to the whole human beings .
