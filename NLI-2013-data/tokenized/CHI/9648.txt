I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .

One of the reason I adovacte is that we can learn more technology .
I can learn some new things when I was trying new things .
For example , I did n't know how to do powerpoint , and we had a small speech in next month last quater .
I could choice any type of way to show my speech , I could use poster or just talk , both of these two ways that I already know and can do very well .
But I wanted to make my speech more interesting , I was thinking of using the powerpoint which I have never used before ; however , it could show all of my idea in it .
Therefore , I started to learn it .
Although it took me a lot of time to learn it , but the result I got was better than I thought .
Morover , I can use it in other speech in future , it will help me so much .

In addition , I can learn how to make plan .
Even I should take risk of lose something or fault .
However it can improve my ability of having the vision and making olan .
Let us see an instance , I plan to go to some place for visite , I have been there several times ; nonetheless , I always go with tour guide and never go by myself .
I make a clearful plane to decide wher to go and where to live , I need to consider how much money I will spend , and if I meet some problem how to deal with , etc. , there will a lot of situation I need to think before .
I can collect information for books , internet , and others experience .
If I have a good travel , than I learn how to make good plan for travel by myself .

In brief , I agree that successful people come from trying new things and take risks .
Because it really can improve me a lot in many place .
