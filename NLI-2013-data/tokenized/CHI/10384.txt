There are many successful people around the world now and if we want to be a successful person , we can learn some things from them .
I agree with this statement which is `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

I think my father is a successful person because he is a good sample for me all the time .
He is a doctor in Taiwan and when he was still a kid , he likes to try new things and always interested in the thing that he does not know .
My grandmother told me a lot of his stories when he is young .
And when he studied in high school , he already knew that he wants to be a doctor in the future .
He always got good marks on the test or homework so he did not worried about these things .
He started to go to some hostipal and see what 's going on in a real place not just in school .
He thinks this would be useful when he actually work in a hospital .
After he graduated , he started to learn how to be a doctor and it was much more difficult than study in school .
He try many nre things such as helping the patiens .
They only did some practices in the school but not for real patiens so it is very hard for him at the first time .
But after many years , he can controls everything in his hospital now .

My father is a good example because he keep continue to learn new things after he graduated and also take risks .
If he only did what he already know in the school , he cannot be a successful doctor in the hospital now .
Therefore I agree with this statement .
