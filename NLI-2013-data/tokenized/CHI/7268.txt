The argument at hand is whether we should travel in a group led by a tour guide .
I disagree with this statement .
In my opinion , travelling on one 's own is a better choice instead .
I can conveniently plan my schedule , use my budget more efficiently , and most importantly , learn about the history of the country that I visit .

Firstly , travelling alone means that I can have a flexible travel plan .
I can book my own air tickets , reserve my own hotel room , and decide when to visit places .
But when I am on my own , I do not have to worry about the needs of the others .
I can choose my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotels that appeals to me most .
I also do not have to visit places that I am not interested in .

Secondly , I can use my budget more efficiently .
If I am to be led by a tour guide , I will have to pay .
The fee is usually very expensive and will account for a large part of my travel expenses .
And since the quality of the service provided by the tour guide is unreliable , I think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hiring a tour guide .
With more money , I can go to more scenic spots and attractions .
I can also afford to buy more souvenirs , and taste expensive cuisine .

Thirdly , I can fully explore the history of the country that I visit when I travel alone .
Tour guides only give superficial information about places , and they seldom tell us about the history .
All they care about catching the coach bus on time , and hurrying places after places .
When I travel alone , I can talk to the local people , and ask them about the local history .
This way , I can have a closer look on the historical background of the region , and learn more about its culture .

To conclude , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I prefer travelling alone .
I can plan my own schedule , utilise my budget more efficiently , and learn about the history of the country that I visit .
