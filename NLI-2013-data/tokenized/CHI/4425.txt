There is a diversity of opinions over the issue of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , Others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinions .
In my point of ivew , however , I fully agree with this position that most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they they really are for the following reasons .
Here are some reasons why .

First of all , consumers ca n't deny that companies spend a lot money to broadcast their prodcuts .
Using pop stars or overstating their effects is one of their ways to sell their products .
However , consumers never think about where these money come from and go .
As a matter of fact , what consumers pay for what they buy going to the advertising because companies want to cousmers to buy their products .
There are a lot of similar products in the markets .
Only one way making consumers to remembe and choose their products is to advertise .

In addition , companies using advertisements tell people that how good their products are .
In fact , people always feel upset because the products do n't satisafy them .
Take myself for a example , one time I bought a food , according to the advertisement , that could helf me to reduce my weight .
Needless to say , I spent a lot of money and time to try it .
However , the outcome was making me pretty upset becuase it did n't work even thoug the company has guarantee about the effects .
After this experience , I never believe what advertisements say .

To sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisements .
My personal experiences and actual observations of life have led me to conclusion that companies spend a lot of money to broadcast their products even though their products does n't seem much better than they really are .
Companies not only exagrrate the abilities of products , but also transfer the costs to the consumers .
