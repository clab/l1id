Cars are playing a domintant role in human society .
Cars benefits people a lot ; they make us travel faster than by bicycle ; they make it convenient for people to travel to a concert .
However , cars also do harms to our daily life ; One of the most fatal harms cars make is the air pollution .
There has been a debate that whether people will give up using cars in future years .
As far as I am comcerned , cars will definitely be supplanted by other forms of transportation because of their disadvantages , though ther have oe or two advantages .
There 're several reasons why the number of cars will decrease .

Although cars have minor advantages to society , the numerous bad effects will make them dissapear after several years .
A car can produce at least three tons of carbon dioxide , which lead to the serious green-house effect , and several tons of nitrogen dioxide , which result from a black smoke around the sky .
with the number of cars growing in the past years , the air pollution made by car is increasingly serious these days .
The laws of forbiding the use of cars have even be made in some country such as Indoesia and China .
As a result , the number of the cars will definitely decline after a few years .

Another reason for the declining of cars is the limited road conditions .
The more cars in the road , the slower they move .
Even in some areas , people riding bicycle are much faster than people driving cars .
In singapore for example , the streets are full of automobiles .
It 's quite difficult for one car to move a foot .
If people see that there are a myriad of cars standing in the street , then how could they buy cars any more in thefuture ?

Though cars do benefits in some minor ways , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobiles before the entirely disappearing of cars , the total number of cars will be fewer in the past twenty years .
