I disagree `` The best way to travel is in a group led bay a tour guide '' , because :
I agree Group travel can be good , because group work is addition of all of group people 's idea Or a person that tarvel a lot , and find the place that you very need to travel .
So Group travel can find place that much pretty than person travel 's place .
This few reson is good for group travel , but I still believe group travel is not better than person tarvel .

I think , person travel means only you to travel a place , so place is you want to traveled , not like Group travel only can travel as Group wants .
This reson is very important , because If you wants to travel one place , that must be you wants to travel so it can be fun .
A example : if you to travel Beijing in China , you do n't wants to travel The Great Wall because you think Great Wall is n't pretty but you wants to travel a small park in Beijing , Is fine to travel that park .
Because you wants to travel small park in Beijing , You agree your thinking not like group trave push you to travel some place .

Difference between Group travel and Personal Travel , Personal Travel it is more Personal , Travel you like ; Travel you need .
But Group travel is not personal anoymore , You need to care about another people at you group not just care about your-self and must travel group like and travel group need .
It make disaggree any personal thinking .
You can not dong where never you want any more .
But for Travel , personal thinking is important .

Also I believe , travel must be fun .
I am not saying group travel should be unhappy , but I am saying group travel can be unhappy , maybe will become unhappy : Because If group tour guide facing a problem that you even do n't think he need to facing , it can often make unhappy between you and your group tour guide .

But if you are not sure about a place that you travel , Group travel by a tour guide will be better A example : if you do n't know there is The Great Wall in Bejing and you only know there is only one small park in Beijing so Group travel by a tour guide is much better .

Thanks for reading .
This is my reason that The best way to travel maybe is not in a group led by a tour guide .
