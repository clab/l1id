Personally , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is for the following reasons .
First , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive .
Second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be .
In addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their communities .

First , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive .
Today , with the economy growing , people have to earn more money to meet their material desires .
In order to make a good living , they spend lots of time to learn skills .
On the contrast , during the past , young people made a easy life , they would have more time to care about other people .

Second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be .
Today , young people are spoiled .
Their parents always provide them a good life .
They can easily get anything they want , so they do n't appreciate the people who take care of them .
Therefore , they are getting more selfish .
For example , one of my friends was born and grew up in a weathy family .
He always thinks `` money is the world '' .
All he cares about is how much money he has .
He totally ignore his family , friends and communities .

In addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their communities .
Parents do n't set a good example for their children to take care or help their communities .
Young people need to learn how to be concerned about their communities .

In brief , if young people nowadays put more attention on their communities , the whole society will be different .
It will become warm and peaceful .
