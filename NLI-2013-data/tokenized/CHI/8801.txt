When human society stepped into 21st centry and technology developped , more and more people realized that understood ideas and concepts were useful .
It is no doubt that ideas and concepts were mostly like a key to crate something especially for students .
I totally agree with this statement : it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I will list three points to support my opinion .

The most important thing is to gain the knowledge from the ideas and concepts .
I 'm a student which have learned our history .
For me , I think most of the antiquity history like mirrors .
History reflect the current events .
Also , there are many ideas and concepts in history .
No matter what we did , it still come from our history .

The other factor , which is equally important , is that the ability which is the view of things from one to three .
For instance , my roomate who come from northeast of China are good at hard science .
When her lab teacher told her to finish a project , she always do it right and fast .
You know what , because she got the ideas and concepts , not just learn from facts .
It more important for students to have this skill to study .

The last one but not the least one is that the appearance of new technologhs .
Everybody knows that Japan were famous for its small technics .
Producting others countries product and absorbing that then having their own technology is their actions .
Do n't borde that .
More than 50 % countries was follow them .
Because Japanese got the ideas and concepts form other technics .

From what I mentioned above , we can draw the conclusion that for students , understand ideas and concepts is more important than the facts we learn .
I suggest the students who want to be success to keep this mind in your head .
