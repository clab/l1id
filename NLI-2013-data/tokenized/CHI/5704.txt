If always watching the TV , you must see many different kind of advertisement .
But most of them are not that true .
I have heard someone said most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , I totally agree this statement , here is some examples for me to support this statement is correct .

All producers must want consumers choose their products while consumers are comparing the product towards other substitutes .
That is the main point why advertisement should make products seem much better than they are .
In fact , their aim is to earn money .

For example , substitutes like fast food shops McDonald and Burger King , Papa Johns and Pizza Hut and so on .
Even films or TV shows , they still only promote the best and the most excited part to audiences .
Indeed , that is normal but this is the main point that they did make the products seem much better .

I had an experience about a film .
watching the advertisement about a horror film through TV , the film was really exciting and the plot seems really attractive and scary , and so i paid and watched the film in a theatre .
However , that is an undoubtedlly bored movie I have seen .
The most frightened and excited you could all know from the TV .
The advertisement really make the product so nice .

Another bad experince is i read a advertisement through magazine which is about a hotel .
The pictures inside were so grand and the food or rooms are nice .
But , when i finally arrived there , i found that the rooms were dirty and those food are aweful .
Then i complained to the manager , but his attitute was bad and arrogant .
The result I had received which is far away form that advertisement which shown in magazine .
I was extremely disappointed with that advertisement which make their product seem better .

In conclusion , actually the advertisements are not 100 percent true , we should pay attention when we decide to buy it or not , and do not just believe the advisetisment .
Therefore , as i said i totally agree with that statement which is totally correct .
