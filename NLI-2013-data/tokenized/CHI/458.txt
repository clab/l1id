It is always a controvertial issue over whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speciallize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , I prefer to be a specialist in one academic field during my university life .

One main factor is the limited time .
In my country , our college eduction lasts 4 years .
During that time , you should not only do your studying but take part in some extra-curriculum activities as well in order to get a good job in the future .
Therefore , it is impossible for a student with an average intellect to learn all the knowledge of every subject in such a short time .

Another factor is that the energy of every people is limited .
You could n't expect the people to sleep less than 4 hours in order to be a generalist .
Also , it is a truth the some people only are suitable to some certain subjects .
If you force them to learn what they are not good at , it 's just a way of wasting their energy .

Last but not least , the purpose of school to educate the people is to serve the society .
That is to say our education should meet the demands of the current society .
What is the rightnow situation ?
Thanks to the developed economy and stable world enviroment , the quantity of the labour forces is not the problem .
What we want now is the improvement of the quality of the labour forces .
That means our society needs the people with a strong background of one certain area instead of those who know only a little about everything .

Admittedly , broad education is very important in today 's education so as to help develope a student properly .
But that does n't to say we should put all our limited time and energy into learning everything .
With the structure of the labor forces becoming more and more reasonable , I believe those who is a master of a certain area will have a promising future .
