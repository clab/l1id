Do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
People hold different views on this issue .
Actually , this topic is so complex and controvesial that it deserves careful consideration .
In my opinion , I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the first reson to illustrate my point is that people will take public transportation system more often than today .
Rather than driving cars by themselves , people would take bus or Mass Rapid Transit System to their destination for it is more convenient .
Take my home city Taipei for example .
Instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hours , people in Taipei prefer taking Mass Rapid Transit System to commute .
I think this will be a trend in the future .

In addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using cars is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution .
For fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy .
Moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using cars is a good method .
Since environment conservation is an important issue nowadays , I think not using cars is quite important .

Finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving cars , Actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive .
Besides the expense of purchasing a car , it costs a lot to maintain and repair it .
Moreover , you have to spend a lot of time as well as money for parking your car .
On the countrary , taking public transportation system is quite smart .
Therefore , I believe more and more people will choose taking public transportation system in the future .

In conclusion , for the reasons mentioned above , I firmly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
