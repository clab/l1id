Some people hold the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today while others believe it in an opposit way .
As far as I 'm concerned that I am standing for it ..

As a matter of fact , with the rapid development of the countries from all over the world , cars indeed play an extremely important role in developing a country 's economy .
However , a better understanding of the pollutions caused by the cars will be enable us to live a better life .
Therefore more and more people have come to recognize the wisdom of not driving the cars .
Instead of that , taking public transportations are valued far more than driving their own cars when they are out by some people , because it not only has brought a large number of profits and convenience to the people 's life but also leaded to less pollutions , As a result people 's life become easier and healthier .
So the attempt by the government to limit the number of cars has been very successful , after all more and more people will give consideration to the public transportation when going ouside .

In addition to that , the importance of the bikes can never be overestimated. , for it is portable and small , that is to say you can take it to anywhere if you want. , therefore more and more people are more willing to ride bikes but to drive cars while they are out .
Apart from that , the bikes wo n't cause so much traffic jam , which will make people waste a large amount of time when they are on their way to work .
Above all , the bikes are regarded as the environmently - friendly tool , which enables people to live in a clean and comfortable conditions .
So to some extent , how wildly the bikes are uesd is a strong determinent of how the environment can be protected .
And an analysis of the meaningful events in history confirms the fact that , in order to save the plannet we live on , we will make good use of the bikes instead of the cars .
Therefore , in the future there will fewer and fewer cars in use It can ce concluded from the above than I agree with this statement .
