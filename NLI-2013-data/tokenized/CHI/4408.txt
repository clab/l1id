I agree that most adertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , the purpose of advertisements have already decided their nature - to attract more customers , no matter how to get it done .
Businesses want their advertisements to make a good impression to people , and to lead people to believe that their products are better than others .
I have found numerous ways that businesses use to achieve this purpose .

Some advertisements intentionally give you the `` good points '' of a product while hiding the actual , sometimes more important , limitations or disadvantages of the product .
For example , some credit card company claims in its advertisements that its credit card service has 0 % APR ( annual payment to the service ) .
However , when customers subscribe to the service excitedly , they find that there are actually other fees with different names associated to the service , which are not mentioned at all in the advertisements .
In this way , the company successfully lead people to believe that their service is cheaper than others , while in fact it might be more expensive .

Another way to trick the people watching advertisements is to make invalid or incomplete comparisons with other companies ' products .
For example , some computer retailer compares his computers with the computers being sold by another retailer .
However , it only compares the features that his computers are better at , while ignoring other important features that might limit the performance of them compared to the other product .
However , people who watch this advertisement often have no expert knowledge of what features are important to computers , thus getting tricked to believe what the advertisements say .

Sometimes , advertisements even use deceptive means to attract customers .
For example , a clothes-selling store gives an advertisement that it will give a sale on Saturday .
It then lists several prices of certain clothes compared to their prices a few days ago .
However , the store actually increased the original price to make a bigger difference in the prices , which deceives customers .

There 're many more ways that advertisements exploit to make their products better than they really are .
In fact , most advertisements do .
