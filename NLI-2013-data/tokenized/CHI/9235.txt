I think understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than simply learning so-called `` facts '' .

History has repeatedly proved that past `` facts '' turn out to be false .
For example , people used to think that all species on earth were created by God and they remain the same all the time .
Today , almost all biologists believe that evolution is the driving force behind all species , past and present .
As environment change , old species extinct and new species emerge .
God has no role in evolution .
Consequently , learning the facts may leave you with wrong information .

If remembering facts is not good , will understanding ideas and concepts help ?
Definitely .
If we think about the above example , people believe God as the only creator of species because they do n't question the claim and never ask for valid evidence to support it .
The idea behind such claim should then be `` How do we know ? ''
Well , in 1859 Charles Dalwin gave many evidence in his historical `` On the Origin of Species : The Theory of Evolution '' .
As time goes by , many scientists found more and more evidence to support the theory .
Such evidence lies in fossils , similarities between living plants and animals and their ancient ancestors and even DNA of all organisms .
We now know all living things share the same universal hereditary code , i.e. , DNA .

Some people may argue that learning facts help a lot when you do n't have access to information you need .
Like when a nurse wants to know how many grams equal to an ounce .
However , in the modern `` Information Time '' when internet is universally accessible and most facts are available on you fingertips .
Most hospital units in the U.S.A. are equipped with computers connected to the internet .
A nurse can simply `` google '' `` gram to ounce '' and get the conversion rate right away .
We no longer need to remember all the `` facts '' .

Ideas are more important than facts .
