Yes , I agree this statement .
For nowadays the young people do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
Say the truth , I think the young people do not care anything beside themselves .
Why I say that they do n't care anything beside themselves .
For exapmle , we can see all the trash near our communities and there are no one to pick it up .
We can see the pinte on the wall .
We can see there is no one to heip old people cross the stree .
That make our communities more and more cool in live .
If we do more there can have more warm into .
Because they do not care so ther are more problem happened .
Like housband hite the wife and kids , old people died in ther own house for several days and young people stolen from the ladies pack .

All the young people only care where can go for play ?
And go shopping .
Is that right ?
In my opoion , I think we can do more for the communities .
Like have a center for old people to go .
And the center have more young people to care the old people .
Because lot of old people are very lonely .
Young people can give them more power in live .
And young people can learn more experense from them .

I 'm a young people .
But I will spend more time to helping communities .
On the weekend I will go to the communities center for a class .
I teach piano to people for free .
There are students , old people and the house wives .
Every time I finish my teaching I feel good .
I know today I do the right think .
There is more means in my live .
I believe that make young people spend more time to helping their communities is good .
That we call communities education .
That will make our socity better and teach how to care other people .
