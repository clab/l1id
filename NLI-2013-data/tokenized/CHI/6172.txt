No one can deny that the sociaty is developing faster and faster .
During the last twenty yeas most of the people were acustomed to the bus and they treated the car as a dream , but now most of the people have their own cars .
And it is no longer ardours for us to buy one .
As well , there are some defects in cars to agaist people use them when some new machine come out .

Firstly , the world is developing in a unblievable rate , the diversification makes more transportation go into our sight .
The car is not the barely tool we can use to move from one place to another -- airplanes , trains and some others are in possission of the impotant status .
No necessary do we need to

Secondly , cars make contributions to the world pollution more and more serious .
In the past , since no manifold cars in the streets , no one pay much attention to the air pollutiong and sound pollution , meanwhile , now , this issue can not be neglected any more .
From the statistic showed in SINA .
COM , majority of the people suggest that the car is condiered the one of the pollution resoures .
If we are in want of solve the environment problem , the elementary thing is reducing the cars .
I believe that the govornment will do sometiong for it .

Last but not the least , in twenty years , many skilled companies are able to create some other machines instead of the car which will use less or unuse the oil and be more efficient .
At that time , though they must be very expensive at first , peopel shall have more interest in them .

All in all , seemingly , cars have been popular among the world so far , in twenty years , when other kinds of transportation which have are advantages over than them , cars will be decreased rapidly .
