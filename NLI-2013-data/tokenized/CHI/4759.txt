Nowadays , we are more and more affected by the advertisements in our everyday life , in which we can hardly avoid facing them .
Some people would deem that most advertisements are very acurate and truely display the quality of the products , others , in contrast , totally disagree with it which is also my point of view .
There are numerous reasons to support my idea and I would like to introduce two of the most conspicuous ones .

First , the purpose of advertisement desides its nature .
We know that the advertisements are used for introduction , for which tons of money are invested by the companies to make their products well-known and popular .
What they expect are the profits , they need the commercials to bring in more money .
So of course they want to show the customers the best sides of their products , while some times it is true and may not so appliable in other conditions .
Take the soda pepsi for example , in the commercials the pepsi seems like to be so cool and so delicious and drinkable , it can wipe out all of your heat within , but actually any kinds of beverage can make it .
So the nature of advertisement for making more profits for the company make it display the best point of one product , which make the products seem much better .

It might be too arbitrary to deside that most advertisements are `` fake '' only by what I listed above .
Another reason for my inclination that they are not so accurate lies in the effect of stars .
The commercials tend to hire stars as their spokesman , for example , the film stars , sports stars and beautiful models .
The results are very obvious , make the customs to believe that they can become stars if they use the same products , which is an additional function that the product cannot actually provide .
Take a certain brand of eye cream for example , if in the advertisement Nicole Kidman is introducing this brand , customers will tend to believe that that eye cream will make them as fabulous as Nicole , while sadly they may not be .
So the effect of the product is enhanced by the stars , resulting in the relatively fake impression to the buyers that the product is better .

All in all , based on what we have discussed above , we can get the conclusion that although most of the advertisements are true , but the added effect may be fake to some extend .
