I agree with the statement .
It is because only new things can brings more chances for people to earn more money .
Doing what is already well-known will just increase the competition of jobs .
As a result , the profit will be limited .
The more successful running a company , the more successful a person is .

Nowadays , things change very fast .
Those people with creative thinking can also earn a lot of money because they can think a lot forward than others .
They know what people will need in the future time and they start running a new company about this .
When others notice that it is a chance to earn big profit , those clever people have already lead in front .

A successful company should have different types of business .
If the clever person can lead lots and lots of business in front of others , he will then be very successful .
It is because he has already earn a very big profit when other companies are still doing the old things .
We say a person is successful becasue he is clever and do something that others cannot do .
If the clever person does not start a new business , how can others know that the business is also a good chance to earn money .
When you do something that follow the other , no matter how good you do , you are still not successful .

When a person starts a new business , it is very dangerous because nobody has tried it before .
A successful person can success because he knows how to solve the problems and reduce risks .
A person fail to start new business is not successful because he cannnot manage the risks .
A successful person must try new things and know how to take the risks .

In conclusion , people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well are successful .
Those people are cleverer than others , they can think more forward than others and they can think something that others can not imagine .
If a person can do them , he is successful .
