I most certainly agree with this statement .
As a music teacher myself , of course I want my students to learn their facts , but it is more important for them to understand it .
I believe that a student should be able to understand what they just learned because that is why we learn in school .
We go to school to learn and understand the materials to apply it to our lives .
If a student did not understand something , then they are not going to be able to use it in life .

The best way of knowing what they have been taught is asking them to use it .
If they can not use what they had learned , then that means they do not understand that certain topic .
It is absolutely pointless for a student to go to class and just memorize facts .
To understand something means you can use it , teach it to someone , and be able to go further than just '' memorizing '' the facts .
To me , in order for any student to excell is for them to be able to use what they know .

I am not saying that learning facts are not important for a student , but sometimes there is no point in teaching that topic to the student if it means they do n't know what just happened .
A student can walk in a class and ` learn the facts ' , but that student will come back out with only facts .

For example , there is a math student who just learned all the numbers of a problem .
Sure , he knows all the numbers , but how in the world the numbers got to where they are is a completely different matter for the student .
That is why teachers today take time to pull things apart and explain them in details .
This situation can happen in any class .
Poetry can be read and the students can read it and learn the vocabulary to only read a poem .
Although to go through the details of the poem would be much more effective in a student 's literature skills .

I do not agree that facts is all we should learn about in life .
There is much more to learning than just facts and statistics .
Being able to truly understand what was taught is the same as saying , `` okay , I know how to use it now and it definitely makes more sense than just memorizing notes . ''
