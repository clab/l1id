With the technology developing so fast today , we have to say that the science and technolgy have have changed our world a lot .
And transportaion also has improved a lot comparing to what it is years ago .
Now air planes , undergrounds , ships are widely used in transportaion .
But if one says that in tewnty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
I strongly disagree with the view .

First of all , cars are really convinient for people to travel , especially when the trip is short .
It can drives from one place to another quickly .
For example , in the cities we are live in , we have to work , study or see friends everyday .
If one has a car , it can save him a lot of time everyday .
No need to stand in a line for the bus and being hurry to catch a underground in order not to be late .
Cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above .
For this reason , more and more people will buy cars on their own .

Seconly , it is necessary for a family to own a car .
A case to prove the point is a example of mine .
We have a car of our own .
So when we want to go out for a trip , we can drive there ourselves .
It liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow .
Sometimes we cannot go to a place because there is no transprtation to there in the past .
So with the demands of the families , there will be more cars on the roads in the future .
More and more families would like to have cars at that time .

Lastly , we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before .
Maybe in the future there maybe other kinds of car to subsitute the cars we are using now .
For the cars are comfortable and convinient , no other transportation can replace them .
And it will also be cheaper in future , so having a car is the first choice of many people , just like the bikes today in China .

From all above , we can get to the conclution that cars are taking a important part in people 's everyday life .
Nothing else can substitute it in many aspects .
So to the oppsite of the point that mentioned in the theme , I think there will more people choose cars as their first transpotation when they are out and certainly there will be more cars in twenty years .
