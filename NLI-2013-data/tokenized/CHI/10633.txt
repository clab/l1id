Base on my own experience I totally agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Now I will give you my conspicious reasons .

First idea comes in to my mind is the definition of successful , that is outstanding which has the same meaning of standing out .
It is to say those successful people should be different from ordinary people .
How to be different ?
The answer definitly not only doing what others already know how to do well .
It is reasonable that the awards usually go to those who try new thinks and take risks because they are outstanding .

Second try new things and take risks can make people more open minded and gain more knowledge and finally make them successful .
When try new things you can get another point of view of the problem .
I can remember that my senior design project was to design a control system for hot blast stoves .
Pervious people solve this kind of problem by classical control methods , however my teammember and I decided to try intellengence method although our advisor warned us that we might fail .
Guess the result , we not only acheived our project successfully , but also got undergraduate research prize .

Reading the history books you may find that each huge development of the world has some relationship with the new inventions .
And more and more schools teach students the invent ability is the most important quality to become successful nowadays .

Look at another side of the statement and suppose that if people only repeated doing what they already know how to do well .
No new theories , no new technoledge , no new applications , how could the world get increasing development .

From all the points I mentioned above we can drive a conclusion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
