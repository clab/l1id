it said that `` young poeple enjoy life more than older people do '' , i dont agree with it .
there are some of my thoughts about it .
first of all , old people have more life exprience than young people , the old people can solve the problem in their life easily , however , the young people usually cannot slove it , and feel sad .

second , the young people do not know how to enjoy the life , for example , the young people think that playing computer games in their house is means enjoying life , Yet it make them do not chat with their friends , even their family .
the young people .
in the other hand , the old people usually will chat with their friend and do something good for them .

apart from knowing how to enjoy the life , the old people are also having more time and money , as the old people do not need to work , they have a lot of time to enjoy their life .
yet , the young people need to go to school , and they usually do not have a lot of money .
so .
the old people can go to trip around the world and enjoy their life .

last but not least , old people can spend more time with their lover , but the young can not spend that much time with their lover .
to sum up , old people enjoy life more than young people because they have more life exprience , more time , more money and they know the means
