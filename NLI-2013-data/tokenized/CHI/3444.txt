Is it generally accepted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
In my opinion , I totally agree about the statement .
I believe that young people really do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
I will argue the statement for some follwing reasons .

First of all , parents nowadays expect their children can get high education , so children 's activity always studying not communities .
Because the society becomes more and more wealthy , parents have much time to take care of their child for their performing in class .
For example , in order to achieve their expectation of education , parents usually take their child to cram school , that really occupy much time for young people .

Secondly , Because of the developing game producing , young people nowadays usually stay home for playing game not go out to communicate with others .
For instance , It is fashion to play PS2 nowadays , young people in order to get high grades in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friends , and they even do n't have any time to commuciate with other people .

To sum up , Because of the high educated expectation and the fascinating games , young people nowadays focus on books or games instead of communities .
Therefore , It is my preference that young people do n't give enough time to helping thire comunities nowadays .
And I think that is not a good phenonmenon for the future , so we should find some resolutions to improve this .
