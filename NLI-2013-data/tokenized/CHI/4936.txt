There are to much products in the world .
So it is imporsible to count them .
Although some product are used in the same way , they made by different company than they will looks different .
I strongly agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , I have some exprience of my own .
For example , one day I was shopping with my mother .
Then we see there is a MP3 player it looks very cool .
Of course , I will ask my mother to buy it for me .
Than my mother said it just looks cool , it not useful than you think my son .
But I still not give up , I said we can ask the seller the MP3 is good or not .
Of course you will get the answer - the player is good to use .
Than I get the MP3 .
After I used it 3 days , it does't work any more .
I told my mother than she said Am I right ?
Why do n't you believe me that time .

So , if do n't want to buy some just looks good ?
We can get some information form your friend whose have a product you want to buy .
Because your firend has used the product for many times than he/she konws it is good not not .
And if you do n't has some friends have some products you want to buy .
You can buy the product by some famous companies , like Sony , Microsoft and any others companys .
Because they famous , that means they makes good products .

So , buy things do not just look they are faces .
Ask help for the seller it is good or not is also not a good way .
we can ask the seller some information from it .
but do not ask good or nor
