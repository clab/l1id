In China , my home country , when we talk about enjoy in the past , we think of getting rid of poverty and wars .
But in this more and more competitive society , even the new challeging and new experience of this world are no longer appearling as some old people may think , when compared to the high pressure we young adults received .
All the pressure : competition with classmates , competition with colleagues , and high pressure of taking care of a new family .

Competition in schools-from elementary school all the way to graduate level , now is heavy like no other period .
Everyone around seems like genius .
And even worse , the parents realise it .
The kids as aerly as only 3 or 4 years old , many are forced to go to take courses on piano , maths or professional athelet .
They live in the competition and do n't have the chance to play with the other kids , or to spend a whole weekend afternoon in the playground .
It actually has caused a lot of psychological problem of those kids .
For a deploma from a prestige college , many kids ca n't stand the high standard from the teachers and parents and commit suicide .
In my opinion , it wo n't be a life enjoyble for these students .

The recent time that I know the deadly competition for empolyment , is when talking to a 82 years old granny I met in a local park .
She told me she was very satisfied with her life now .
But the only thing she keep concering of is the work of her children .
One of them have a undergraduate degree , but cannot get a work with $ 60 USD a month .
The insurance is problem , the house rent is a problem , even the food becomes a main concern .
This probelm is facing many young adults , especially those who just go into the professional area .

Teenage mom is no longer news , and it thoroughly reflect a social problem when solving the family issue of young adults .
Most high school dropouts , if it 's not for the study problem , it 's the teenage moms .
They give birth to a new life , but also sacrifice their life to receive better education and better occupation .
Another feature odf modern society , is the age of newly marriage couple are getting older and older .
Everybody seems lost in the work , and rarely have time or energy to face the marriage and commitment .
Many guys in their 30s , do n't know anything about women , is no longer somthing rare , too .
When facing these big issues in life , young adults seem have very fragile feelings , and most of them are not happy with them .

As a result , young people are a social group experiencing high pressure from all aspects .
Their lives are not enjoyble .
