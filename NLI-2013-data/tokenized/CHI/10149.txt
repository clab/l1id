Nowadays , some successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In my opinion , I totally agree with this point , and it is a good thing .
following my discussion , you will see the reasons .

Firstly , successful people should try to new things , because it is a big chanllenge for them .
Although successful people already success , they sometimes need a bigger chanllenge and it will make them got a lot of good feeling , then they can continue to more successful step .

Secondly , it is ability that should to learn for successful people .
Today , following Technology and Science 's development , more and more people succed , absolutely , it is very good thing for this time , but successful people should try new things and take risk and they should n't stop to the one thing .
because as a successful people , they also have many stress in their life , so they should learn lots of ability and knowlege that they can not be lost by this world , otherwise , maybe one day , they will become a common person from a successful people .

Finally , take risks and try new things is a very helpful and useful thing for successful people .
It is really ture that they should try it .

In conclusion , Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a good thing .
