Some of the companies use advertisements to sell their products .
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I support my view with following reasons and examples .

First , advertisements give visual view to people .
Especial to the young children , a lot of food products are used the catoon images and toils to attract the kids .
When the kids see their favorite characters , they will request the parents to buy that certain food regarless the taste and health .
For example , the restaurant advertise for the free toils if you buy one set of kids meal including frech fries .
The food is not healthy , but the kids love it because of the free gift .

Second , advertisements tell you the result of the products .
I have seen many weight lost products such as tea , and protein diet , etc ...
The TV commercial displays the products with a woman who has loose weight such kilograms after using this typical product .
They also show the womam 's contrasted picture before and after using it .
Control weight is determined not only about your diet , but also your healthy lifestyle .
For example , less fat consumption and more frequently excercise are better pratice for your body than just taking lost products .

In conclusion , some of the adervertisements have more attraction than products themselves .
