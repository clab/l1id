Given the choose about young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , which do I considering ?
It is assumed that the answer is negetive .
However , in my opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are three points presented as followed .

First , it is in terms of education that young people taked do not teach them to helping their communities .
Not only the school does not pay attention with but also the parients do not spend time at their communities , neigher do the children .

Second , it is in terms of entretainment that young people pay much time on and no time to helping their communitues .
Because of the interesting vided games comes more and more , the yough people spend all most of time to play and do not concentrated on the other things like homeworks or their communities .

Third , it is in terms of growing technology that many people enjoy cause that lake of time in their communities .
Although the technology can make life more conveniently but its benefits also can make people isolated by focusing on their little devices .
In addition , modern sociaty needs lake of neberhoods to help them to prevent thref or other happens by using high-thch devices .

To sum up , those are my point of view of yough people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , among them educational problem , playing too much , and growing technology .
