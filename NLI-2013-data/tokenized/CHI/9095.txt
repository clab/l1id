With the current trend of stressing a person 's ability to understand and apply ideas in modern workplace , a dillema that whether understanding concepts is more important for students than learning facts arose .
I strongly disagree with the statement as learning facts is a indispensoble process of a person 's development and should be highly emphasized .

The primary reason is that the facts we learned and accumulated are the foundation to bulid up and enhance our understanding of ideas .
When we were young , we had limited ability to understand the world around us .
It was the facts we told by parents , media and society helped us to generate a preliminary understanding of functions and roles of materials surrounded us .
Our understanding gradually developed by considering the facted we learned and applied it to the situation we face .
With the more facts , we would be able to unambiguously inteprete ideas and help us to apply in real world situation .
Therefore , learning facts is conducive to consolidate the foundationa and explore our capacity of comprehending concepts we encounter in later stage .

Learning facts also helps to develop an appropriate cognition of ourselves in the whole community .
Facts of the past and present time of various subjects and aspects of human community enable us to contruct our comprehension of our roles in society and help us to determine our career and life goals .
Without sufficient information , we might narrow our scope and focus our attention on a limited facet of problems we met as well as life decisions .
Learning facts broaden our horizon and enable us to explore our lives in all sorts of directions .

As a nutshell , the ability of comprehending concepts would only be practicle and utilitarian in real life situations when a person has assimilated adequate facts for him to make corresponding decision .
It is certainly not worthwile on stressing students ' ability to understand ideas and ingnore their needs to learn facts .
