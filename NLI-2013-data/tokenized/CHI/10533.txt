I agree people should take the risks in new things .
It is the path to the great achievement .
A new busness requires a new and unique idea .
The reason is people already make the benefits from the ideas that have been used .
If the new businessman does not come with a new idea , the customers and bank would not be interested in that .
Therefore , I agree a new businessman should take the risks in new things rather than doing what people already know .

In 1970s , Steve Jobs starts his own computer business .
In that time , no one believe computers would enter everyone 's life and become part of it .
Steve trusts his prediction to the furture and spend his entire energy to improve computer .
He does not use DOS systerm ( use word to control ) that people generally use in that time and create a new systerm that uses picture to control computer instead using DOS .
This innovation makes him successful and let computer becomes easier that general people to use .
Right now , Steve is the chairman of Apple company which is one of the larest computer company in the world .

Steve 's successful story becomes the modern new entrepreneurers ' goal .
Follwing the past ideas to start a new business has only a few chance to survive .
Surveying all of the past business story can give lots evidences to support it .
Therefore , taking risks in new things has lots chance rather than doing what was doing in the past .
