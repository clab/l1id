yes i 'm agree it ,
i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
nowdays students very clearly , they can use thier think do every things , if they ahve more interest in something , they will do it all time .
as a student not just learn some information and knowleadge form class and teacher , more and more people think use their think about something more useful just learn some information from calss .

with world was development , more and more comnpany want to own high skill people , but people have high skill not just learn from class , you must think about everything use your brain , if you think about some ideas , it 's was yours .
not other people , although your ideas was not very true , it was yours , it means you make your brain , and think about something , you unstand these ideas and concepts then you can think about again , you can use your option ,

some of country , they teach student some knowledages , they just teach then htese , they never let student why you chosse this , then student also dont ask teacher why , i think it was not your knowledage , you could n't remember it , beacuse you not understand it , you just read it , it was very bad for your study .

now , most of school was suggestion teacher how to teach student , i think when you learn some information you must understand these meanings , it was basic , beacuse only you have understand these meaning , then you can use youe own ideas to explain it , it was a good behavior , if you always to do it , then you have a good behavior , it was very useful for you , if you have some troubles , you not wrooy about it , you will face to it , beacuse you know you can use your brain to do it .

so i think student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
everybody must learn it , it was very useful for you .
