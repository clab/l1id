I disagree with the opion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Although to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help people know different fields acknowledges , we only can know the surface knowledge about each subjects .
So I prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject .

To begin with , our time is limit .
We can not study every subject well .
We can not acquire the true knowledge and tecnical if we sperate our time into many subjects .
For instance , if a students learned arts , psychology , math and drawing in his colledge life .
I think he may know a lot of things .
However it is difficult to him have a good mark in every fields .

On the other hand , if we pay most of our time in one field .
We can know a lot in this fields than others .
For example , a student whose subject is psychology pay most of his time in the psychology .
Maybe he can know this field well .
He can write papers about this fields and find job in this fields .

In summary , I think it is better to have a specailize broad knowledge in one subject than to broad knowledge in many subjects .
It is good for person and the whole society .
