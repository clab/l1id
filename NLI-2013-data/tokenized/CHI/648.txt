Have you ever benefited from the broad knowledge of many academic subjects or from the specific subjeck ?
From my point of view , i believe that i would choose to have the specific knowledge of academic subject .
The reasons as following .

First of all , i believe that choose to gain specific knowledge of academic subject is more effective and more efficient of learning .
For example , if i like foreign languages , and i want to be a person who good at languages .
All i need to do is try my best to acquire the knowledge of languages academic .
In that way , i can as quickly as possible to become a master of languages .

In addition , i believe that choose to gain specific knowledge of academic subject is more easy to make my dream come true .
Inasmuch as you concentrated on the specific knowledge that you like , you would realize your dream as quick as other , For example , i want to be a english teacher , this is my dream , so i choose the Department of English for my major .
someone who can concentrated on what he study is easier as well as faster success than those who choose to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

To sum up , while someone want to have broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects , i would choose to the differ .
Therefore i would gain the knowledge of the specific subject which i liked .
