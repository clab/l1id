I am in complete agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Although there are , of course , exceptions to this situation as with all other aspects of life , it appears quite clear to me that in general , youngsters these days simply do not have the time nor the interest to engage in community work .

Youngsters these days may not be required to plough the fields and run the family business as in olden days , but that does not necessarily translate into a sudden increase of free time .
As technology advances , youngsters suddenly find themselves in an increasingly competitive world , where every skill , every achievement is of the utmost importance .
Suddenly going to school is not enough ; students are pressured into scoring better than their peers , and this is achieved through sending youngsters to cram school .
Learning how to play the piano or dance ballet may have been a privilege in the past , but this is not so now .
All these `` extra '' skills have become commonplace - even necessary to ensure that one will not `` lose out '' in the long run .
This is where all the `` free time '' has gone to - trying to survive .
There are no more weekends ; only endless `` optional '' classes to go to .
Is it a wonder that young people nowadays do not appear to have enough time to help their communities ?

Another reason is pure apathy .
Young people are generally more self-centered than adults .
This is probably because we are all , in general , pampered from the time we were born until well into our adolescence .
Hence , youngsters , yet to face the harsh realities of life , are inevitably more narcissistic and fail to see how the welfare of `` other people '' is of any concern to them .
To them `` the community '' is something adults should manage and worry about .
These youngsters may read about the ongoing problems of their community in the papers everyday and still regard it all as happening in an unrelated place far , far away .
Parents are partly to blame in this matter .
By pressuring their children to be an overachiever in school , they have failed to instil the right amount of compassion and empathy in them .
Instead , children are brought up looking at life in terms of rewards .
Get good grades at school and mommy or daddy will give them a shiny new bike .
So when it comes to helping their communities , it all invariably boils down to the question : `` What do I get out of helping my community ? ''
.

Schools and other educational institutionals are equally to blame for moulding children into apathetic youngsters .
In certain less developed countries , such as Malaysia , children are required to learn `` moral studies '' in class .
However , it seems highly puzzling that students do not go out on trips to clean up the streets or hold charity sales for a good cause .
Instead , they are required to memorize specific words or phrases in order to get good grades during their finals .
Moreover , the examples used in the textbook do not keep up with the times .
Most of these examples still speak of villagers and broken wooden houses , and thus fail to reflect the situation in urban modern life .
Is it any wonder that students feel alienated from these `` community work '' and end up not doing enough of it ?
