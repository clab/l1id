I did n't agree with the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
First reason is that i think travel is a very personal experience and that does n't need many people come and finish with me .
Second reason is that the travel agency will bring me to a fixed place and fixed time to travel places that most people should look and that also means I ca n't have enough time to take adventures .
Third reason is that most of the tour guides really just provide limit and small information from the tour text books .
I will provide more detail about my points .

The first reason I did n't like to join a travel group is that I think travel is a very personal experience that is a process of dialuate with myself .
I will enjoy the singal travel experience that I can read , stay with the local residents and sit down to write when I meet what touch my heart as my wish .

The second reason is that the travel agencies always provide some limit places that cost them less money and limit the time for the travel spots .
So I ca n't have some more adventures to deeper places , talk with more people , and take more detail on the place .
That is very pity .
More over , they will bring me to some boring shopping centers that are always waste my time .

The third reason is the most important part to me that is the toup gides are n't local residents or they are just provide too little information to me .
Some even ca n't give me more information except from the tour gide text books .

To my point of view , I did n't agree with the point that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Because travel means to me is more personal , more relax time to go and to touch the things and to understand more about where are the culture differences .
So fixed time and fixed places way of travel group is not just not my choice .
