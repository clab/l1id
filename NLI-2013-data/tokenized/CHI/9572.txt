All the people known that if people want to be success they must try a lots of new things and also the people should take risks .
If only doing things that they already know , the people should not be success or maybe make long time get successful .

First , successful people try new things and take risks can make them work hard .
Successful people expecilly young like try new things to attack them concentrate , so they want discover or know the new things whick others do n't know that .
If they interest that , the successful people must be work hard than other time , that 's good for them carneer .

Second , if successful people like risks , they can improve them make more money for their business .
If some people like stock , only the people have enough money and experiences , it 's not enough , people also should like challageing , so people can get succesful than before .

Finally , though successful people would like try new things and take risks , but sometimes it 's not good for their heathy .
Most people only work in office , they do n't like do the sport and do more exercise , that really a big problem in the society .

I think Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .
That 's why some peolpe can get success .
