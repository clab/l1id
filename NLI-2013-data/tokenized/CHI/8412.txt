I agree to understand the idea and concept is important than learn the fact .
It is because I think it is easier for you to doing something if you know concept .

Actually the concept and idea is the basic , if you know the concept of that thing , it is not hard for you to learn the facts .
Because the facts are also coming from the concept .
For example , a studant can understand an idea of the Calculas , it is not hard for him to do other questions in the textbook .
Like the `` idea '' are the theory in the Mathematics textbook , and the `` facts '' are the example that stated in the textbook , you may say it is easier for you read the example to know how to do the Maths problem .
And it seemed to be the fastest way for you to learn .
But I am not agree to this , because I know that learning theories is the best way to do the questions .
Because therea are a bunch of questions in the Maths textbook .
If you are reading the examples , you need to read at least ten examples in one chapter .
Maybe you will get lose in the final few questions , beacuse they are harder than before , they do n't show on the example .
During a test , you may also get lost in it , because you never see them show on the textbook .
But you only need to know two or three theories in one chapter , and you can know how to do all the questions in this chapter or test .

That 's why I think `` concept '' and `` idea '' can help more than the `` facts '' did .
The facts may be varied and have many different kinds , but all of them are based on concept .
That 's why it is not hard for you to do something if you are already know the concept of it .
The other exmaple of understanding concept is better than learning facts is cooking a cake .
Because it is almost the same for cooking different kinds of cake , whatever the intergents or how to cook .
You still need eggs , flour , butter and so on .
And finally you still need to put it into the oven .
Whatever you make a green tea cake or cheese cake .
For you to know the facts are only both of them need eggs , flour , green tea or cheese .
That 's make you busy and need to memorize all of these .
It will waste you more time and hard to memorize if you are going to learn hundred different kinds of cakes .

Finally , I perfer understand ideas and concepts are important for you to doing all the things than learn the facts only .
