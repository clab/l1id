In fact , I disagree with the statement .
Why ?
Because the Internet .

When the Internet have n't been built , there are more interaction between people .
So you can see many young people in their community to care about the community .
The Internet is so popular nowadays , those young people in public occasion might disappear , but they have been using their way to take care of the community .
For example , young people can set up the community in the Internet .
If the residents in the community have some issue to discuss , they can enter the visual community to change their information or give advices .
Communicating by the Internet is faster and more powerful than the traditional face-to-face method .
Everyone in the community has access to the informaion immediately after these information was post in the community of the Internet .
And they can react it right away .
The government can know the informaion sooner than before and they can adjust the policy about the city .

Moreover , young people do not always sit in front of the computer .
In my community , many young people volunteer to help the elderly people in the community .
I , for instance , make a routine to clean the house beloning to theelderly people whose child are far away the community .
Sometimes , I also serve as the tutor of the orphans in the orphanage .
My neighbor , James , also do the same thing with me and we all feel satisfied after helping others .
Of course , there are many young people like us in our community .

Based on the preceding points I made , I can conclude that the new generation does help their community both viturall and pratically .
