regard of whether car will be fewer in use than there are today , or vice visa , people have diverse opinions .
if i had my way , i would fully side with the notion that cars , or other tools of transcommunication are the detriments of the environment and will be reduced in twenty years .

what is beyond a shadow of doubt is that the tempo of the technology has never been rapid as it is today , due to this , we live in a world , where the technology contributes both benefits and widespread plagues .

however , if there is a view that cars could contributes such a tremendous advantages and convenient that would not be reduced or replaced , which i take leave to suspect , then it is the romantic and naive people who create it , not those who never fail to be with consideretion of reality and modern society , in so far as it is univeral acknowledged that cars is the major reason to the air pollution , which is the vitalest problem today and leave all the people in a lanch .

so , what we could deduct from general principles is that we thrive on technology , and decend on technology .
to explain my meaning perfectly , let me give you a concrete example .
due to the massive air pollution , what we breath is not as clearly as it used to be , and most of them caused from the pipes of the cars .
and by making the cars less accessible and more costly to people , by stignazing them with a anti-cars compain , the authority still trying to reduce the numbers of cars , in order to solve the air pollution .

all things considered , making the cars fewer is a trend in twenty years ahead .
if it is not , it would be without any consideraions of our next generation , be no regards of our own physical statement , and without any ideas of other species on the earth .
