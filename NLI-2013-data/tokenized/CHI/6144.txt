It is no doubt that cars bring us some benefits in the past and present because of its convienency .
However , cars also have bad effects on our society , including pollution , traffic and enery resouses .
As far as I am concerned , with the developments of socity and technoly , the number of cars will decreases in the twenty years for the following reasons .

Firstly , more and more peole wil take the public transportations insteading of taking individual cars .
There are several opotions of transportation for the citizens to choose and they will be more convient than cars .
Take subway for an example , it may only take you one hour to your office in the rush hour of the morning .
If you drive your own car , it is more likely to have traffic jams .
Besides , taking the public transportation is more economical than taking the cars .
Hence , the public transportations will play a more important role in our daily life than present .

Secondly , the cars will be decreased because of the awareness of enviorment .
As we all know , the cars is one of the most pollutions of our enviorment .
It can bring us noisy and bad air .
In some areas , the goverment have published the ban to prenvent from the increasing of cars because of the enviorment , especially in big city .
In addtion , citizens in the country have awared this problem .
they have already take some actions to protect their enviorment conditons .
In the point of view , many peole will not buy their own cars , considering the pollution of the car .

Finally , in twenty years , the new technolies will appear , with the advents of new things , car may be placed by other things , which is more comfortable and less disadventages .

In conclusion , even through cars is also very important now , the develpment of technolgy and awearness of people in the enviorment will lead the number of cars fewer than there are today .
