In essence , I totally agree that a broad span of knowledge of many subjects is better than specialization in one subject .

A broad knowledge span of many academic fields contributes to the overall scholarly status , or level of education , of a person .
The world we live in revolves around everything we can perceive from science to literature to general knowledge .
For example , a physicist who can only talk about physics and the very technical areas of his field of study is , at least to me , very difficult to be called a scholarly person .
It is true that he may excel in his own field of specialization but he will find it to earn respect from people in the society in general , partly because his lack of knowledge of ` other ' subjects implicitly implies his disregard for the people engaged in these ` other ' subjects .
To me , this physicist can not be called an educated person .

In my opinion , no one field of specialization can evolve and flourish solely on its own .
After all , whatever ideas , however abstract , that are involved in that field are developed and perceived by human beings who live in the real world that comprises of all different things .
It is inevitable that even the most abstract of ideas in one field should have the slightest association to another idea most likely in another field .
Since these can be linked in some way or another , it is apparently condusive to know other fields in order to see these links and perhaps also to better the field of specialization .

Another advantage of a broad knowledge span is different approaches and perspectives to viewing a problem .
Different academic areas implement different ways of thinking about problems .
For example , maths mainly adopts logic and reasoning , while literature may use a more elegant and artistic style to viewing the world .
Realizing this should make a person more flexible in solving problems in general and better understand the things around us , or concepts in his field of specialization , in multiple perspectives .

The above re-emphasizes the fact that single specialization is not desirable .
