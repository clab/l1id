Many people say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Personally , I firmly disagree with the state that there will be fewer cars in the future .
I have two main reasons to support my position .

To begin with , I believe that there will be more population in the world in twenty years .
It is no doubt that there will be more cars at that time since car is the main transportation .
To cite the first example , people need car especially the of developing country .
It is the truth that the public transportation is more unconvenient than the developed country .
Unfortunatelly , the developing country often has fast-growing population .
Consequently , the only thing they can do is to buy a car .

In addition , I think that car is a tool we use to judge a man .
Car is not only a product , it is the symbol of the property , To cite the seconde example , we usually compare our car with other 's .
I had seen many young people who want buy a new car even though they do n't have enough money , Besides , the advertisement also help us regarde car as an symbol of future .

Considering the above reasons , while there are many people think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , I choose to differ .
I firmly believe that car will be more important in the future .
