Study of many academic subject is good ?
We usually study many different classes when we in the high school , is it really good for us ?
Study broard knowlege of many academic subjects is really good ?
I can n't agree with it .
In my opinion , study a specialize in one specific subject is more useful .

when I was a child , my teacher aways hold the points that all the children should study all kinds of knowledge .
but i never think so .
in my viewpoint , study too much different knowledge in the same time , i will not concentrat on .
i believe that study one thongs deeply is suitable for me .

and people in the sociaty , thery will find the jib which they study in the university .
but if you studay too much academic subjects maybe you will hard to find job , the reason is the boss in the company will think that you study too many different academic , you should not study them deeply , so they will not consider to use you at first .

and study too much academic subjects will also ues too much money , not everyone can do it .
i still remember one of my friends she study a lot of subjects , but she did not have the good graduated points at last , because she did not have enough time to rewview them .

so study many of academic subjects may be is not for all of us , and that is also not have such advantage for us , so i decidecid to sudy one subjects deeply , maybe is easily for me , and easiler for most of us , we also canhave much time to enjoy ourself , spend more time wih our family , commuincation with each other , so i prefer the second one , study one pecific subject is more useful .
