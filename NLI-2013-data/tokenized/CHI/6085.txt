I agree with the statement .
First , nowadays there are many cars in use , you can see everywhere , we use them instead of by foot , because it 's easy and fast .
but the air pollution problem is became a strong problem .
most car-gases be taken into the air , and we breath dirty gas into our body .
when twenty yeas past , I think our air will be destroyed badly .
so the govement must be reduce the cars productions and the cars will be fewer use than there are today .

Second , people today use cars instead of by foot because they are comfotbal , but they have n't realize that step by foot is a body exercise for our health .
we can stronthen our body and do more exercises everytime .

Third , use fewer cars can reduce our traffic jam .
today big cities are all have terrible traffic , especally in rush times , and more traffic jam happened , whenthe cars became fewer the problem will be sloved .

and we are more safty when we out .
Became the population grew more and more , this method must be a good one .
Above these three reasons , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and our life will be more comfotbal and safty .
