Should we study in the specific subject as some people content ?
I agree with this point insofar as that as a college student the major course is important for us .
However , those people might begs the question by neglecting the fact that the `` ture education '' means having many different area knowleage .
When I face with this situation , I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic .

In one important aspect , studying other subject is clearly accurate in the extent that every subject could connect with each other .
They could not stand by their own , for example , without the knowledge about math , chemistry will not do the correct the data from the lab .

In addtion , for `` ture education '' the more significant consideration is that in the modern society , we need many differert subject knowledge to have our own become more competitive when facing the development of the technology .
Any observant person could list the adequate to illustrate this point , consider the development of the computer .
If we do not know how to computer , which company might employ us and how we get the so many information around the world ?

Aside from the two propositions mentioned above , one caveat might come along with having too knowledge of other subjects .
Specializing in our major subject provide the us to get the certain job in subject .
The contrary side of board knowledge would mirror a too-narrow view about the true education and its adequate objective .
I would admonish that extending the point too far may risk having a chilling effect on the university study .

In sum , even though I prefer to have broad knowledge about the different subjects , no area of the education could operate in a vacuum .
To becoming `` true education '' , we must strike the apt balance between the major study and the pursuit .
Whether means of education is justifiable must be determined on case-by-case basis by weighting the benefit of the individual and society .
