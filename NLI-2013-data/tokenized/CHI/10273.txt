Do successful people willing to try new things and take risks ?
The answer is concerned to be negative , but I totally agree the point of view .
There are three reasons of my opinion presented as followed .

First , it is the adventurous spirit that successful people usually have .
It is easier to learn new knowledges by asking a lot of question .
In addition , it offers more opportunities for them to grasp something new by asking questions or reading lots of books .
How to make things they already know more perfect and convenient are the priority thing to them .

Second , it is the special view that the successful people take with .
Different from the others , they look things in the long run but not just a short term .
They consider things not only from one single aspect but also from many points of views in the future .
That can actually make sure for their success life .

Third , it is the unsatisifing with what they already know how to do well make them eager to find more difficult challenges to complete .
The more difficulty of the challenge , the more they want .
Challenging hard thing

To sum up , I think successful people are willing to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reasons , among them by having the adventurous spirit , special points of view , and always not satisfing with what they have .
