in moden world , people may have less time that intend to enjoy lesiure .
nevertheless , yong people cost much time in working or studing that spring from severe competition .
they may work or study 10 hours or more a day and they may work hard in the weekend , that looks like mashines .
they don not seem to exhaust any time .
sometime i think they are crazy .
but older people have spare time , they may think they do not own enough time in the world .
they cherished time looks like gold .
so older people may travel in world or enjoy happy life comfortable , beautiful , tranquil country .
that is right , they have retired , they have worked for much of life , they need have a test .

in the West , older people may travel in the world , they want to utilize less live time in order to learn the world as enough as possible .
they are intersting in East culture particulary .
everyyear , many West older people get to china compactly .
i think that is good choice .
older people can gain knowledge and happy .
that is significant object .
but older people in my mother country , they have much different kinds of entrainment activity .
they play dance in city park , they play tiaji , and they play chess .
that is better too .

however , older enjoy life more than yough people
