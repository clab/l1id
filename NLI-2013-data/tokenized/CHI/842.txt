In my opinion , a man should have a specialized knoledge on one specific subject .
The reasons , both including social aspects and individual aspects , are illustrated below .

For the social aspects , today , more and more companies require a person to be armed with a spefical knowledge .
Only by doing this can help companies stay competiable because those people is the ones contribute a lot to companies by using their strong knowledge .
For example , if a person who wants to go to Intel to design CPU chips , then he needs a strong knowledge of Electronic Engineering and helps Intel stay advaced all the time .
There is no reason for a company to hire a person who does n't have any specific knowledge , because every people has his specific job in the firm .
Even more generally speaking , companies , as well as our society , need those who have a specific knowledges to make changes in this world and let our world become better .

On the other hand , from an individual point of view .
The more he devotes himeself onto a certain subject , the more knowledge he will get .
For instance , he who feels like studying law might have the change to understand his career direction earilier than others .
This helps him to stand out of crowds and becomes sucessful in future as soon as possible .
Bill Gates is just a vivid example , who loves computer science so much that even decided to quit school when he was only a college student .
Later , he built up his career as well as this world 's honor : Microsoft .
By the same priciple , a person who concentrates on a specific subject could gain a deeper understanding on it thus broaden his view on this field , by easily meeting with a variaty of friends .
Meeting people , attending lecture , or conference becomes a good oppertunity for him to even become better in this field .

Based on those above points , I think it 's better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success as well as change our world .
