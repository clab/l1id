Yes , I believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Tour guides are often more experienced and more familiar with the place of travel and they can show us the speciality about that place .

Travelling in a group alone or with friends in a foreign country without a tour guide is like getting lost in a maze .
We wouldn not know how to communicate with local people , how to buy things and even get the food we want .
Also , it might be hard to travel to the landmarks without understanding the way transportation works in that particular country .
On the other hand , if we have a tour guide with us , he would probably have some connections with the travel agencies and it would be easier to communicate with local people and also bring us to the local attractions that we want to see without any problems .

Tour guides are meant to be hired for people travelling in foreign countries and need a person to guide or lead them .
Tour guides are professionally trained and experienced with the country they are guiding in .
They are often from that particular country and they know how to speak the local language and they understand how things work , so that you would feel more comfortable and would trust them as being your leader .

Although you might not get to do certain things that you had in mind , when travelling in a group with a tour guide , you would definitely have a great time and it would be the best , and the safest way to travel .
With a tour guide , you get to experience or see the local life styles , local food , and local attractions , much more easier than travelling by yourself blindly , not knowing where exactly you are yourself .
In conclusion , in my opinion , the best way to travel is indeed in a group led by a tour guide as you get to experience a wider range or varieties of sight-seeing places without getting lost and to experience different sorts of local culture .
