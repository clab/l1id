Do you agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Most people may diagree that because they think people will rely on cars more in the future than today .
However , I agree with the statement because I think the technology will create new transpotation tool to replace the car .
I will argue over my perspectives with the following reasons .

First of all , accoring to the insufficient of the petroleum , scitients are eager to device new tools to replace the cars .
Nowadays the oil resources become a searious problem all over the world .
Since the resource are limited , humans can not use it without restriction .
However , people are too late to get aware of that , so the price of oil starting soaring up and it might cause the third world war .
In order to avoid the energy problem become the trigger of the war , every countries will decrease the use of cars .

Secondly , people in the future will develope a more efficent and rapid transportation tool which can replace cars .
Although it only happens in the movie now , the future people will fly in the sky , I still believe it can come true under the scientists endeavor .
People become more and more lazy and the ground get crowder than before , without any space to extend , it seems to reansonable to enlarge people 's living to the sky .
In addition , fly can save more time and also solve traffic problems happens now .
However , this need the technology to reach the goal and I expect that .

To sum up , although cars are main tool that people depend on , with the overuse of cars , there are a lot of peoblems emerging .
In order to release ourselves from vicious circle , human beings will initiate one new thing to help us attain the same goal .
In other words , people is going to invent air-transpoted tools to declin the number of cars .
