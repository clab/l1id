I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
My argument is clearly supported by the following reasons and examples .
To illustrate the point , we first want to know the purpose of the advertisement .
Why are the manufacturers spending so much money on advertisements .
The anwer is quite simple to everybody .
They want to make money out of the products .
That determines that most advertisements exaggerate the advantages of the products , and rarely mentioned the downsides .
And the disadvantages are usully played down if they are mentioned at all .
For example , Toyota claims that the Prius , the most famous brand of hybrid cars , can run 42 miles per gallon of gas .
However , that 's not true , at least for most of situations .
The typical mileage of Prius is only around 35 , a quite gap from the Toyota 's claim .
In fact , you can get mileages close to 42 when you drive on the highway only .
Obviously , the advertisement put out by Toyota handily never mention that .

There is another example .
Proactive , the famed medication for treating acny , states in the advertiesment , that it works very well on different types of skins , no matter dry , sensitive , very moisture .
It turns out that it is not true either .
It only works fairly well on dry skill .
It does n't work on the sensitive skin at all .
In turn , it could make the situation worse .

The nature of an advertisement is essentially determined by its mission , marketing the product for its producer .
Thus I strongly believe that all advertisements are doing exaggerations , more or less .
Since almost all risks generated by using the products are on consumers , therefore , consumers should do their own researches when puchasing products , especially for higly valued goods or important products for health .
