Some people claim that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
However , I hold a opposing view due to the following resons :

First , gaining in-deth knowledge on many academic subjects would be extremely time consuming .
Studying many different kind of subjects requires the students to spend a lot of time and effort in it .
In this way , the students can only learn some superficial knowledge about each subjects but cannot really have a very in-depth understandings of the subjects .
On the other hand , studying one specific subject can allow you to specialize in it and acquire thorough and in-depth knowledge about the subject .

In addition , many careers are specialists and thus require the specific knowledge of that particular subject .
For example , being a lawyer you need to have specific knowledge about the law terms , the judiciary system and the judiciary situation of the place you want to work in .
You can not enter those specific careers unless you specialize and acquire in-depth knowlegde about that academic subject .

Last but not least , having specialized in one specific subject can offer you chance to investigate the field which is not touched by people before .
You can hardly discover new things or findings in your study unless you have in-death and specific knowledge in that particular subject .
For example , if you want to pose a revolution in astronomy study , you need to specialize yourself in it , spending lots of time and efforts in it or else it would be impossible for you to make any revolutionary findings .
One can see that the previous scientists who triggered off scientific revolution are those who spent their life time in the study of science .

To conclude , I believe that specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge on many different subjects but with superficial knowledges only .
