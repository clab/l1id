With the recent reapid economy , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .
Consequently , there is controversy issue over the topic : what kind of people enjoy life more : old peple or young people ?
Some people think old people enjoy life more ; while others insist that young people enjoy life more .
As for me , the choice , nevertheless , is not easy to make .
After considering my fondness and personalities , i choose the latter .
As one of the famous saying goes in the country : young people are the masters of games .
In the following disccusion , i would like to reason and provide evidence for my point of view .

First of all , young people have more activities to play with like : they can climb mountains , skate , swim and so on .
For example , on New Years Eve , i went to skate in the city hall , and we had a lot of fun .
However , not much of old people went to skate .
One of the reasons is that their heath conditions do not allowthem to do so .

Secondly , young people are more enthusiastic .
They are willing to try really exiciting games .
For example , last year , my brothers went to poji .
It a game that people jump from a high mountain really quickly like about several minites .
Your heart should be tolerated enough to overcome the scary .
According to a statistic conducted by University of Toronto , 95.47 of the people who play the poji is young people .

Admitedly , old people enjoys life in certain circumstances .
For instance , they walk dogs and have tea together .
But those activities are limited and not much fun compare to young peoples activities .
So that is i think the better choice should be that young people enjoy life more .

There are still a lot of reasons for my fondness of that young people enjoy life more .
The obvious ones have provides as above .
In conclusion , that why i think youngpeople enjoy life more .
