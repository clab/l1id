Advertisements were one of the most powerful commercial ways to stimulate customer to pay for the product .
I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The purpose of an advertisements is to attract your notion and inspire you to have a try with the product .
There are different kinds of advertisements , such as posters , commercial on TV , and advertisements on the Internet .
No matter wich of them , photos of the products was the most important and necessary materials to creat an advertisements .
The more attractive the photo looks loke , te more possibility the customers will buy it .
Bsed on this idea , businessmen will try their best to have the product photo reaches the perfect condition .
For instance , in food advertisement , the photo of food always seems shining and delicious , and there will also be some decoration by the dishes .
But in the actual situation , the quality of the food in restaurant might change , or even get worse .
For another example , in cloth advertisement , the company will find beautiful models to wear the new dresses , thus , dresses will seem more fitful and wonderful on model .
By seeing those product on such a perfect condition , many people will be stimulated to take a look or have a try on the new products .
Sometimes , the businessmen will not expect you to buy it , but as long as you saw the advertisement once , you will have a image in your brain .
Then , you may one day try it , or tell the information to your friends .

As more experiences in your life , you will recognize what kind of advertisements are far decorated from the true product and what are similar with the real product .
For the most famous brand , their advertisements are really close the the real product .
Sometimes , just think as you are a businessman , you will realize why the advertisements will always seem better !
