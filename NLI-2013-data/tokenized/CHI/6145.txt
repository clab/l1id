Cars which are the most typical transportations are widely used by the people all over the world .
But lately people found that cars also should responsible for the serious air pollutions .
So , according to this reason , many people requires the government to restrict the number of the cars and they believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
I do n't quite agree with this statement for following reasons .

Though too many cars will pollute the air , it is a convenient way to travel by car .
And this thought will not change for only a couple of scores .
There may be many kind of transportations , such as bus , subways , planes , ships and so on , but not can be compared as cars .
Take me for an example , if I want to go to a supermarket which is 4 miles away from my home , what transport would I first consister ?
Of cause the car !
I do n't want to waste my time to wait for a bus , it is unable to take plane or ship and the subway station is far away from my house .
In conclution , unless we invent another kind of transportation , cars wil still become the best transportaion in decades

The biggest problem of the car , everyone can tell , is the waste air and smoke .
Cars use gasline as their power and release harmful gases which pollute the air .
Gasline may be run out and air should never be polluted .
However , this problem can be solved .
Recently , many car builders have invent new cars that use solar power rather than gasline .
This is sure to help protect our natural resources and our environment .

The overcrowed roads may be the second biggest problem .
Many of people think that we must solve it , otherwise we will hard to move efficiently .
But this problem is due to the over-growing population , it 's not the cars ' fault .
If the population decreases , this problem will not exsit .
So this is not the excuse not using the car .

All in all , we must find a positive way to solve the problem .
Using the solar power and solve the road problem , the car will still be useful and helpful .
As a result , the car will not decrease in twenty years .
