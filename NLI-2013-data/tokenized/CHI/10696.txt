People will always success because they like to try anything .
They always get new things when they try .
If Peop do not try , they always

First of all , there is always not only one way to solve a problem .
You always can use different way to solve a problem if you want .
Maybe what you do is not the best way , or what you made is not the best thing .
You need to try .
Every time your trying is also a lerning .
You try more , and you learn more .

Secondly , why people is better than animals ?
Because people can think .
People create things by their thinking .
If people do not like to think , what different between peopl and animals ?
For the same way , people who try new things and take risk than only doing what they already know will always go fowoard .
They always can create new things , and everything is the way to success .

In the conclusion , why people can be successful ?
Because they have many methods to lead them ten to success , and those methods come from their thinks .
Only when you creat a new ideal , you can do better than other people .
Try to tink much , and you will get much .
Do n't always do the thing by the same way .
Trying will lead you to see more thlngs .
