Yes .
I agree .
Because as the TV , Internet , developed to help people get the information really easy .
To make people notice is not a problem .
But the product is not only sold by one company .
In order to let people spend their money buying the products become really important .
Advertisements always use something shacked word and well noticed senctice to effect peolpe 's desire of shopping .
For example medicine .
Some company will use many people to show how their product works and compare with different company .
But as we know it depend on different body 's effect .
In some fast food restaurant the picture of the meal usually looks like full and hot .
for some reason to make it fast and commercial way , it is really difficult to make it looks like the picture .
In the company , there must have different people make the product and the advertisements .
In order to finish their job .
They both want to do the best .
Advertisements is the first line to the customors .
sometimes the product may be just ok but if it had a good advertisement it could probably change customors ' mind .
That works , the company made money .
and the people not only buy their product but the most important things the Ad .

Advertisements made people fight with their desire .
When people paid the money and find out that they did not satisfyed .
because we always want better or more .
Sometimes in our mind feels that we should n't spend that much just for that things and find a reason to argue .
But anyway advertisements works .
That is why the company rather spend their money on the advertisements than on the mass of product .
Consider to the products , if it just ok and not really far as the advertisements people still accept it .
Take a look carefully before we buy .
