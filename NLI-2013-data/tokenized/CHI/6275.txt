Since the traffic issue is one of the most serious problems in many big cities , it has been discussed by lots people .
For example , whether the driver should pay for parking lots , or whether the government should encourage citizens to take public transportation system are popular topics among the traffic issue .
Since many people are concerned about the problem , in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Personally , I would say `` yes '' .
The reasons go as follows .

First , since the citizens suffer a lot from the traffic congestion in daily life , more people would choose not to buy a car , and find the alternative way to transport convieniently .
For example , a officer who go to work by car may not attend an important meeting on time , if he is unfortunately being delayed by the crowded traffic in the rush hour .
However , if he could take a bus or MRT , things

Secondly , gorvernment in many countries spend huge money in developing their public commuting system , such as MRT .
Considering the advantages of these system , like huge accommodation , convience , and safety , gorvernment are encourged to invest on these public transportation system .
It can be infered that with a well-developed public commuting system , the citizens would prefer to utilize the facility as possible as they can .

Finally , with the rising price of oil , having a private car would become a burden to those car-owners .
When it comes to oil , we may deem it as precious resource on earth .
Therefore , the rising price of oil is a natural thing .
Not buying or using a car would be a wise method to save the money spending on oil .
Furthermore , this could reduce the pollution produced by the oil .

Above all , it can be concluded that the fear of traffic congestion , the government 's effort in building public commuting system , and the expensive cost of oil will undoubtedly make people decide not to buy a car .
In that way , there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
