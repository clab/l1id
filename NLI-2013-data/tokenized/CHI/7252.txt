I disagree to travel around with a tour guide .
It will be great to travel around the places that we like is to travel by ourself because if we travel by ourself , we can spend our time freely .
We do not have to care that the guide is going to go somewhere in a few minutes or they are going to spend a lot of time at the places that you do not really like .
It will also be relax to travel by yourself , you can wake up in the hotel whenever you want , you can go to eat anything you like in any time .
Ane you can also have changes in your trips .

In order to have a good trip for ourself , it will be good to just go to the places that we like and spend our time in the things that we are interested in .
If we go with a guide , we only have limit time in all the places .
And there might be some places that we do not like .

We always want to feel relax on our trips .
We are not there for business , we are there to have fun .
So if we go there with a guide , we will have to followed the rule of the guide and we will have to get up in the time that they want us to get up .

There will always have some accidents in our trips and it will be good for us to make some changes in order to solve those problems .
But if we go there with a guide , our plan has already been decided .
We would not have any chances to change our plan .

For these three reasons , I recomand that we should go on a trip by ourself but not be leading by other people .
