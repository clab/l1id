As is known to everyone , there are lots of advertisements has been created druing this medium period .
some people think advertisements make products seem as the same as they really are .
on the other hands , some people do n't think so .
In my point of view , i agree the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons why i agree are as follows .

First of all , advertisements become more creative and interesting , owing to attract more buyers to buy their products .
If the advertisements are really boring , there is no one will be persued to buy their products .
What 's more , there are lots of products in the world .
Some sellers suffer more pressure about how to get a important role in this market , As a conquence , the advertisements will show more information about such good products they sell .
Even though , the products are really not as good as advertisements present .
Worst of all , it 's a negative cycle .
Lots of advertisements follow this kind of trend to gain more profits from consumers .

By way of conclusion , i totally agree this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In order to attract more buyers and then earm more money , the advertisements make products which become more amazing and creative , but not they really are .
It is a really negative cycle in our society .
However , many people do n't pay much attention about this issue .
What a pity it is .
