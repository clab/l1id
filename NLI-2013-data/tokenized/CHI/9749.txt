I will agree the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
The people who try new things will get more chance to be successful in these new things .
They also can build a good interest in their lives .
Finally , they can lead our society to a higher level .

People try new things and take risks will have a higher chance to achieve their goals .
They are the first people who take the opportunties to try and research these things .
For sure they are so brave and never give , so , they will keep trying and trying until they finally work out they won goals .

When these people finish they new things and risks , and success at them , they will enjoy the taste of them .
This taste is what they are looking for while they are taking the risks , at last , they ca n't get out of this taste and keep trying other new things .
For example , Edison and Newton never stop after he has invented light-ball .

Those people much be high educated , knowledgable and skillful .
They need to use their skill and knowledgabel to solve the problems that exits during the research .
On one hand , other people can use the new knowledge that they have found , and use this thing to up-date theirselves .
On the other hand , those people have already high educated .
They can open a course or a programe to our sociey and pass the knowlege to younger generations .
Basicly , that will blance the society and bright our society to a hight level .

People try new things and take risks have more advantages than the people who only doing what they already know how to do well .
For these people who keep doing the old things , out knowledge and society wo n't be improved .
So I agree the statement .
