Today , the information is very easy to get , and every company need the people who have many knowledges of different fields .
So , I think if students can learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Then , their thinking will become more extensive , and they can get a high-paid job .
Finally , they will have good development of their future .

Nowaday , internet is very common .
Therefore , every country is conneted with each other .
It means everyone will compete to the other people more serious .
For examle , ten years ago , the students in Taiwan just needed to compete with the Taiwan people .
Now they need to compete with China students or American students .
Therefore , students need to have extensive knowledge and it will help them to create new thought .

Next , if we have many professional skills , like computer managing or finanical skill .
It can help us to get a high-paid job .
Because if the companies hires this kind of people , it seems that they have different fields people .
So if we can be this person , we will get a high-paid job , and the companies also can save money to hire many people .
But how to let us have broad knowledge ?
The only way which I think we should learn different academic subjects in the school .
If we just focus on one specific subject , we will lose chance .

Some people think if we do not focus on a specific subject , we will not learn very well .
We will not be professional in our field .
In my opinion , I think it is wrong .
If we just learn one field , it may be easy for us .
But in future , we will be sad because we can not comete with the other people , Therefore , I agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specizlize in one specific subject .
