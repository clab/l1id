In China , there is an old saying that says , ` If one have one hundred subjects , all of them are poor and nity-nine of them is in the air . '
This saying well describe the relation between the quantity and the quality of the subjects .

I 'm for the statement that it 's better to have a speciallize in one subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic .
First of all , nowsdays , the sociaty needs expert that means deviding works into many parts and ask the expert on this aera to solve the problem he 's good at .
There is one good example around me .
In a computer company , there are many parts of the aeras .
Some do with the computers , some do with the machines such as coffee offer , the air conditioner , or the car .
Once I went to see my friend working in this company , the coffee offer was broken down by accident .
I asked my friend , ` Why do n't you repair it , it is so important in the daily life . '
However , my friend said , ` The cechanic is coming , I think the job suit him better and I am for the computer .
He 's absolutely right .
He 's job is working with the computer , he do n't need to repair the coffee offer because he is n't professional about this .

In this way , a person do n't need to know every thing .
Deviding jobs can make working professional and in this way , the effection will increase and the quality will also get higher , therefore , people can safe a lot of time and finish work well .

In another view , it is because we are not good at everything that our life is colourful as we meet many new people when we are working in a new field .
One of life 's goodness is that we can communicate and coopertion .

To sum up , it 's better to speciallize in one specific subject than to devide a limit period of time into so many subjects .
