First of all , trying news things is the basic requirement for people who want to become successful .
Successful people are ambitious and passionate about life .
Success cannot lack of risks and attempts .
Invention needs creative mind while crestive mind needs trying of new things .
Many famous scientists eventually become successful only because they are willing to try many different kinds of things .
Without the courages of taking risks , they would never innvent so many ` impossible things ' .
So , successful people want to try new things because they have creative mind .

Secondly , trying news things can make a person feel more confident about himself or herself .
At the same time , confidence is required by people who want to be success .

Thus , in order to become successul in business world , people have to take some risks .
As long as they get through the risks , then they would taste the fruit of success .
