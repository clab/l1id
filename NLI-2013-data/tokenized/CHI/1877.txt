Apparetly , different people hold different view dues to their respective angles , it seems that it is a little bit hard any absolut consent .
On the one hand , some people advocate that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
on the other hand , others disagree the above topic .

First of all , in my mind , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do , that is ture .
For enample , young people like noise place , bar , large shop , karo ...
older people are difference , they like quire place park ( in the morning ) , walking , fishing ...
How come ?
because we are the young man , we have power , eneger .
That is older people ca n't have .

Secondly , young people clearly than older people , I say a normal young man , for examples , memory young man is better than older man .
So we can doing
