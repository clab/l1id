Some people hold the opinion that young perople enjoy life more than older people do .
Others have the oppsite point of view .
This statement has caused a heat debate for a long time .
However , as far as I am concerned , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , at least it 's the case in China .

Since China is still a developping country , so by comparaison with the western developed countries , like the USA or the France , the generation of my grand parents are normally not rich .
As a result , they do not travel a lot as their children do .
They prefer to save money for later use .
Consequently , most of the chinese old people , after their retirement , choose to stay at home every day instead of going out to enjoy life as their children do .

Also , there is a tradition in China that grand-parents look after their grand-children .
This situation is considered rather common in the society .
Consequently , you can find a lot of young couples go for a trip alone and leave their children to their parents .

However , let 's take a look at how the young people enjoy their life .
Firstly , the young people have more liberty as they are more energetic .
As I have mentioned above , the young people do not need to worry about their children even when they are away since it is a tradition that the grand-parents take care of the grand-children when the parents are not there .
And relatively , this young generation is richer than their parents are , so they choose to spend their money on enjoying their lives , going for a trip for example .

Secondly , it is so commun that you find numbers of young people in the cinema after work or during the weekend .
And they go to a bar with their friends after work , or go to a gymnasium during the weekends .
Since they are young and energetic , they know how to take advantage of their spare time and enjoy their life .
However , it is so rare to find old people in pubs or in gymnasiums in China .

Maybe that 's not the case in Europe or in the USA .
However , I find in China , it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Perhaps there will be a change in the near future ?
Who knows ?
