Nowadays , more and more people say that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
They think that many young people buy the luxruy things , spend more and more time and money on the internet and video games .
The older people , however , always spend theri time to do the housework , or watch the TV at home .
But does it true that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do ?

I think I cannot agree with this saying .
Because every peorid of one 's life has its own features .
We cannot only say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Firstly , older people always think everything in their way , so maybe they think the next generation always not good as them .
For example , the kids who were born in 1960's and after were called The Generation Ca n't Support .
But they are the main part of the economy and poltic now .
They are excellent as their father and grandfather .
So the viewpoint that the young people enjoy life more than older people is just a stereotype .

Secondly , I think every old people has ever been young before .
So they must know that the young people is much more active than older people .
They know go to club or play basketball when they are free .
They cannot stop moving .
But it is not to enjoy the life , it is the instinctive of the young man .
That not means that the young man enjoy the life more the older people .

Thirdly , many older people know how to enjoy the life more than the young people .
Because many young people do n't have enough money to enjoy the life .
They need to word .
But the older people who has earned enough money to use during the holiday , or buy the expensive cars , etc .

So the older people maybe know how to enjoy the life more than young people .
