There is a common opinion that the number of automobile users will reduce in the future twenty years , because of a great deal of problems that using cars brought about .
But people may be regardless of the benefits that we human beings drerived from automobile .

Why do we still need automobile twenty years later ?
The most important characteristic about automobile is coveniece .
Rember there was a time when you drove your kids to schools ?
A time when you drove to the countryside to have a picnic with your friends ?
A time when you drove hurridly for a meeting ?
How can you forget about those pleasent time u spent with your car and how will u be willing to throwing away , even after 20 years time ?
We all need cars to bring us convenice and pleasure .

One point that shold be admitted that , cars bring with them a series of problems , like air pollution , traffic jams , traffic accidents .
In most of the big cities , the large number of car using cause serious air pollution , as a result , many people complain about this situation or even suggest that we should stop make use of cars .

To solve the problem , it can not be dealt with simply by preventing us form using automobiles .
A more effetive way is to improve the automobile condition .
Governments should invest a larger amout of money to make progress on automobile producing , in order to reduce or stop harmful gas emmitting from cars .
This is not the only responsobility for governments or scientist , is for all the human beings on earth .
In this way , the process of using cars can be continued .
We can both get benefits for convenience and fresh air breathing .

To sum up , we will be better off with cares in 20 years .
