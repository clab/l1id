Personally , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is because young people are more energetic , more healthy and have more adventures .

First of all , younger people tend to have stronger bodies ; they are full of energy .
They can play a lot of exciting sports .
For example , younger people can paly basketball , rock climbing , snowboarding and so on .
However , these kinds of sports will not be very good for elders because they tend to be tired very soon and they will not be able to enjoy themselves .
Moreover , younger people are able to recover very fast after big games so that they can be ready for their next activities .

In addition to being more energetic , yonger people are healthier .
They tend to have strong bodies because they are growing up instead of getting old .
Being strong has the advantages of enjoy their lives more .
For instance , young people can eat almost anything they want to eat such junk food .
This is because they do not have to worry about getting some disease .
On the other hand , older people have to worry about their diets all the time because they tend to have problem with illnesses such as diabetes .
Having healthy bodies truely are the big advantage for young people to enjoy their lives more .

Finally , younger people will have more adventures .
This is because they have more time than the elders do .
For example , younger people are able to change jobs once a year , and they are not worried because they can always find a job .
Even if in a labour work , younger people are fit .
They can at least make their ends come meet .
Most of all , they can spend their leisure time doing lots of activities such as travelling aroung .
As for older people , they may not have as much oppotunities as younger people do .
They have to be careful all the time and worry about losing their jobs .
And they definately do not have the time to explore our modern society .

It is clear that younger people will enjoy their lives more .
This is because they have more energy .
Also , they have stronger and healthier bodies .
Last but not least , they are able to spend more time on coming across their exciting life experiences .
