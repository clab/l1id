Some people who support most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are but others argue with it .
But I have to say that , if I were faced with the direction , I would probably follow most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .
First reason refers to profit .
Only you show your product is very nice , the people will by it .
but problem is their product not really so nice .
so they use advertisements to expend their merits of products .
Secondly , no consequence and law to control their behavir .
In the following disscusion , I would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint .

No issue is more important than now the one that refers to profit .
History witnesses and presents many examples .
Such as some products of company lead the people dieth or disable ; or some hair condition include the toxins ; or some toy hurt the children .
But alll this product in the advertisements is the best product compare the sample kind of products in the wold .
the people do not know the truth , and buy it .
This way can make a huge number of profit for the companies , so they like to do that .
Do you think these examples are very persuasive ?

Another reason is head and chief that I have chosen to put here .
It is no better illustration can demonstrate the view .
For instance , the people know some advertsements is not true .
But they also are not so much fake , too .
So the people can not use the law or some rule to control their actions .
This case is exist in the most of advertisements .
If you can see that , you can understant it more deeply .
So the most striking conclusion is obovious .

To sum up , givern the reasons discussed above , we can arrive the conclusion that most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .
NO only did I prefer to agree with this point , but also I were a witness , too .
