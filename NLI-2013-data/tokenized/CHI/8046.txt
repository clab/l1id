People always discuss that which one is more imporatnt betwee understanding ideas or concepts and learning fact .
In my opinion , make students learn fact is more useful and helpful than just make them understand the concepts and ideas .

First of all , if students just understant the ideas and the concepts then when they face the problem in the real world they will not know how to solve it .
The propuse of people learn knowledge is they want to studt how to use these information to solve the proble in the society , so master the skills to face and deal with the problem that they have is the most important rask .

Secondly , let the student learn facts throuhg the practice can make them more clever and give them much important information .
Throuhg their experiences they can learn many thing that they can not study in the classroom .
These useful information and experiences can teach them ues thier own way to solve the difficult problem and make them become more wise .

Thirdly , if people can understant how to face the fact then they will have a better relationship with other people and the whole society .
they will use a suitable way to consider their life , and do a better choice .
The connection between single person and the whole society also will become bettter .

People live in a complex real world all the time , we will meet many different peolple and many difficult problem , but if we can understand the fact completely and know how to use the right way to solve them , then we can get a bettter life .
Because of these rasons , learning how to face the facts become a so imporatnt thing in people 's lives , if we can learn and understand facts but not just know the concepts and ideas .
