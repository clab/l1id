Is there fewer cars in twenty years than there are today ?
Although there are many variables and uncertainties may affect the number of car , I agree with the statement .
First , the airpollusion is geting more and more serious .
In the last centry , the human beings have made too many cars .
In some big city , the exhaust of car is the main reason to cause breath illness .
The goverment also notices that , and it tries to prevent the problem getting worse .
One way is to reduce the number of car .

Besides , to drive in the rush hour in the city drives all drivers crazy , and it is almost impossible to find a parking lot in the down town .
The trafic problem in the city also attract people to go to work by taking public transportation , and give up their desire to own their cars .
The number and quality of public transportation are growing in most countries , and I think it can replace the role of car in the twenty years .

Finally , the oil price now has raised about three times as three years before .
The pertroliem will be depleted someday , and people 's concern about the problem is reflected on the price now .
So the cost to maintain the car is much higher than before .
I believe under the presure of rapid growth of oil price , people will turms to other choices , such as bicycle and bus , and the the number of cars will be reduced .

All in all , I regard that almost all the varibles do not promote the increasing of car , and fewer cars in the future can be expected .
