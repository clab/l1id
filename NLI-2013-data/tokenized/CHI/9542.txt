When faced to the questions that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , different people had disaparate views for that .
In my poit of view , I agreed the view that successful people should try various and new things and take many risks .
Here I will explore some significant and conspicious reasons as follows :

The first reason to support my opnion is that in oder to make big contributions to the society where we live and as the pregress of the society , more and more things needs people who have higher skills and excellent abillities to do the tought staffs .
Therefore , people should face this situtuation and try their best to do the this as good as he/she can , especially , for those successful people .
They shoud adapt the new environment and at the same time , the successful people should try thier best to concentrate on some new tecnologies , such as knowing the skills of how to do well about computers .

What is worth noticing that trying new and creative things can help people to improve their characteristics , especially it is good for people to become brave .
For example , Masier is one of the famous artists in the art fieds , and he is very famous for the harmony art .
At the begining , he can not find the key elements of art , but he did not give up it .
After taking risks about art and hard working again and agian , finally , he becomes a very excellent artist in the art field .

Another reason is that trying new things can make people more hard working on the thigs what you concentrate on .
The process will let people not easily to say give up and try their best to do well for thier things and this will provide a big chace for them to find aa good job and become succeful in the end .

In conclusion , I agree that the successful people should try nem things and take risks rather only doing what they already know how to do well .
