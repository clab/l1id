Some people agree best way to trvavle is in a group led by a tour guide and some people disagree like this .
I agree this statement .
First because we know the way to travel is in a group , I can make some friends with same interst , and we ca n't feel lonly with a group , If I go to travel only me then I must think the travel is so boring .

Also , in a group lad by a tour guide , we can know , some important information such as we can go to which some famous place in this travel , and we can know some history stories in this travel , And we can eat difference food between in our live city .
If you do n't in a group you can miss this .

Finally , we must very happy in this travel we can play with many people .
And remebe some intersting things .
So I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide !
