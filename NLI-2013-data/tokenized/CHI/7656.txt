It is sometimes difficult to discuss people 's views on the way of travelling because it is such a multifaceted topic .
Some tend to think that there are many merits to travel by their own plans while others say it is better to be led by a tour guide .
I have developed my own opinions on the topic .
I favor the latter position over the former for several reasons , and I would like to explore two of the conspicuous ones in the following passages .

First of all , if we are led by a guide , we do not have to spend a great amount of time considering where to go and how long to stay .
The guide has already arranged the schedule for us .
As a result , all we have to do is follow the schdule and have a good time .
For instance , when I was a junior high student , my parents and I went to Singapore led by a tour guide .
The tour guide was so familiar with the country that she introduced us everything about Singapore .
Needless to say , we visited the most important spots in the country .
All of us really appreciated the tour guide for such a wonderful trip .

Second thing that must be taken into consideration is that we are likely to make new friends in the group .
It goes without saying that it is very boring when we visit some interesting places without friends .

In the group , we can make good friends with one another and share all the happiness on the trip .
For examples , on the travel to singapore , my new friends and I played together day and night .
They did bring me a lot of fun during the trip .
Though the trip is over for a long time , we have still kept in touch closely .

Of course , I do not suggest that my perspectives are unassailable .
There are still some advantages for us to take a travel on our own plans .
Nevertheless , I think the opinions I have provided above are more important and stronger .
