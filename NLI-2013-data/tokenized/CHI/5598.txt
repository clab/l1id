There 's a truth that some advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but there are still some of them are the same as they really are .
It 's difficult to directly say that whether most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , there are only a few people make advertisements seem much better than the advertisements really are nowadays , and also in the future .

Advertisements are used for introducting the stuffs what are expected to sell , so if the advertisements makers show people some real advertisements .
There will be many people who are glad to buy .
There wo n't be a problem that if people have known the things well , because after they have spent their money once , thet will believe these advertisements , and maybe some of people will regard them as their favourate , whatever which kind of advertisements they are .
For example , food , tools or electrical equipments .
They 'll be sold well , and the sellers will get a lot of money in the future because their honest in the advertisements .
So it 's good to make advertisements as real as they are .

We have to believe that nowadays there are also some sellers who make advertisements much better than they really are .
At first , a lot of people do n't know the advertisements a lot , so maybe the sellers can increse the prise and earn a lot of money in the beginning .
Later , after everyone has known the truth of the advertisements , how can the sellers get money continue ?
They cannot !

All in all , I think that not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
