Have you ever heard of his story ?
He played soccer instead of playing tennis when he was in his fancy age .
In spite of the fact that he had never played tennis before , his bravery encouraged him to taste tennis .

Why do n't we try new things ?

Apart from doing something new , learning to take risks is also critical to a success .
Risk management plays a major role in any kinds of business , sports , politics .
