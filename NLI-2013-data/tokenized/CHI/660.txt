Have you ever noticed about the issue that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialized in one specific subject .
In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects provides people broden their scope .
Besides , it can people learn a lot of things and enrich their life .

First of all , Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can broden people scope .
For example , Learning many subjects provides an opportunity to know many people .
People have different religions , cultures , experiences .
During learning different subjects , people share their knowledge and experiences with each other .
It can open each other 's mind and absorb much informaation .
As a result , learning many academic subjects can open our mind .

Secondly , learning many academic subjects can learn a lot of things .
Experts and scholars pass their knowledge by the books .
From the books , we learn their knowledge .
Therefore , by learning the books from many academic subjects , we will prevent the mistakes they made and become wise and smart .
For xample , I majored in forreign languages in university .
After graduating from university , I went to Adult Education Graduate Institute in National Taiwan Normal University in Taiwan .
Now I am a junior high school teacher .
In the daytime , I teach teenage students English .
At night , I teach adults Mandarin and English .
I think what I learned in university and what I learn in graduate school help me to teach the teenagers and the adults .
It makes me feel that teaching is meaningful and happy .

To sum up , I definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it can broaden scope .
In addition , it provides people more chances to learn more things .
