There is on doubt that , young people play as an ever-increasing important role in our society , because they are more creative , active and vigorous than adult people in many aspects .
However , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First of all , young people nowadays pay too much attention on their study .
Because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exams , decreasing their concerning about other things such as family chore , community activities , to name a few .
For instance , my community holds a feast festival on the moon festival every september ; unfortuneately , the date is close to young students ' mid-exam , there are very few young people helping to organize the feast , not to mention attending the feast .

Moreover , in the recent decades , people tend to have only one or two children in each family ; accordingly , young people nowadays do not have many siblings to get along with .
The phenomenon leads them to more self-centered individuals , rather than team-work persons .
They care much more about themselves , such as school achievement , personal pleasure and interests , evaluation from peers ; namely , some public affairs like community service is not likely to draw their attention .

To conclude , young people indeed plays an important role in our society in that they are the future generation , and what they tend to be meaningfully influence what our world is going to be .
I believe that young people are more intelligent and creative than adult people ; also , they are sure to make our world better .
But , if young people can concern more about public affairs to learn the spirit about teamwork , contribution and mutual help , they can contribute to our world much more , since our modern society cannot operate through independant individuals , but cooperation .
