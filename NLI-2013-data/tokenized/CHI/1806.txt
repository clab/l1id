Some people claim young people live a more valuable and interesting life than the older people do .
The other people , however take the opposite point of view .
In my opinion , I believe older people can enjoy life more than young people do .
I shall set forth two major reasons in support of this .

Firstly , older people normally know the meaning of life better than the youth .
They have richer life experiences and from which they have learnt what kind of things are worth doing .
In this way they are more likely to spend their time on the pursuits more valuable .
By pursuing these precious goals , their life are full of meaning and have more fun than some young `` couch potatoes '' who do not know where they should go .
For an instance , I used to live with an old lady for a while .
She was eighty years old , but she kept making baby clothes everyday for the children in orphanage .
She considered it as considerably valuable , and thus she greatly enjoyed the way she lived her life .
So older people gain more life experiences through years and generally know deeper about the meaning of life , which brighten their life .

Secondly , young people are more likely to enjoy their life in more superficial way .
It is easy to see that a lot of teenagers indulge in video games and TV programs which keep them from sophiscated thinking .
They are easily attracted by superficial pleasures and the life they enjoy is less valuable than the life with deliberate considerations and long-term plans which older people normally make .

In brief , older people can live a more meaningful life and thus enjoy life with higher quality than some young people do .
Therefore , from my point of view , older people can live a more joyful life than young people do .
