Nowadays , whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a prevalent topic which has been widly debated .
Two different views exist to support or oppose .
After considering several aspects , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more .

First of all , yong people have a strong study ability to learn new things around them .
For example , computer is a new technology product in nowadays , young people prefer to go on line for fun , buying things on internet and making friends on it .
Because they think it may save a lot of time and money .
However , the oler people may prefer to live in a traditional way , since they do n't want to change their life style after living under the same one for ten or twenty years .
That 's why they do n't want to taste the new things , though they are good .

Second , young people have much more energy than older people have .
The young people may often go to climb mountains and make a hike with their friends to see the beautiful flowers , blue sky and green sea .
And after a long walk or traveling , they may recover quickly and go on with another adventure .
By contrast , the older people do n't have this advantage .
Since they are old , their phisycial condition is not as well as used to be .
They can just stay at home to watch TV or have fun near where they live .
Therefore , older people 's life is limited .

Last but not least , the young people are much more creative .
When they see something new or interesting , they may think of a lot of question related , such as why it is so cute or how they make it .
After considering about these questiones , they may go to liberay and disscus with the friends for more details , and then they will try to improve it , create a better one .
The young people enjoy thinking new things .
But the older people may not be so active , because they have a lot of experiences .
They may judge things according to their experience and compare the question with the situation that they familiar with .
Therefoer , we can always hear that old people complained about the boring life .

From what have been talked above , we may safely draw a conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
