People are learning to grow with the basic skills and experience , so it is much more significant for young people to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts instead , and the reasons are as the folowings .

First of all , knowing the concepts and ideas can help young people understand the rules of this world and see the common points exist between disinct peope and things , which gives them the basic point of view about the society they live in .
Besides , most of the facts happen according to the concept and their ideas .
For instance , the young people are supposed to show respect to the elders in the society as the principles and a nice manner , like the government provide the elders more protection and help in finance and health care each year .
In this case , everyone regards it as a right and valuable thing to do , so this rule goes on and on .
The young people know this rule will easily understand the way this society runs and come up with a right and fare opinion about this .
As a result , knowing the concepts is knowing the world properly and quickly .

The second is that the so called `` facts '' are enumorous in this world and young people cannot learn them all even in his whole life .
There are always some spacial cases in each field of facts that will cinfuse the young people who do not know the concepts and ideas of most of the things that happen around him .
In that way , people is definitly having trouble in understand things and dealing with things they met .
What is worse , the lack of knowledge of concepts will make the young people lose themselves .
The facts are the surface of concepts and ideas while the unpridictable facts are waiting for people to find by themselves .

Finnally , not knowing the concepts of facts willl give the young people wrong direction for they only learn their life based on things they see , and do not know how to look at them in a proper and objective way .
This will lead to an bad result and a young student , for instance , will not understand will the criminals are punished while they do not know how people are supposed to behave in this world .

Therefore , to understand the concepts and ideas are much more important than merely knowing the facts so called .
