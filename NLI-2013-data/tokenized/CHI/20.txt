In a modern society , people always face the dilemma of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than having specialized knowledge in one specific subject .
This question is such a much-debated one that it affects almost everyone in his or her daily life and deserves some close examinations .
As far as I am concerned , I vote for the former , which means I do agree with this statement .
Among various reasons that support my choice stance is that having broad knowledge can make you more attractive , can provide more oppotunities for you career , and can make your life more interesting .

Basic to any understanding of reason preferring having broad knowledge is that it can make you more attractive .
If you are knowledgeable in many academic subjects , you can share more information with your friends and people arrounding you .
For instance , I have a friend who has deep understanding in many fields , such as history , mathematics , music , and even cooking .
I like talking to him , because I can learn much from him .
That 's why , in my opinion , broad knowledge can make one attractive .

Moreover , having broad knowledge can provide more oppotunities for you career .
You have more choices .
A persuasive example is that one of classmates has got an exellent job besides her major .
She has both strong knowledge in both industrial engineering , which is her major , and software designing .
Eventually , she got the job as a programmer , which provides a decent salary .
We are all admire her now .
Therefore , if you have broad knowledge , you have more oppotunities for you career .
Furthermore , you can live better based on the broad knowledge .

Besides , the further reason , not the last , why argee with this statement is that it can make your life more interesting .
In fact , my father is just the person who has broad knowledge .
In his spare time , he play tennis , translate Germany literatures , and design mechanical equipment .
His life is colorful .
As a proverb says , `` Various knowledage can make a person rich . ''
In today 's world , having broad knowledge does give you incredible experiences and make you a rich mind person .
It is obviously that only these three reasons can make everyone draw the conclusion that , not to mention there are more reasons that account for my propensity for it .

In summary , from what we have discussed above , we can safely come to the conclusion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and I agree with this statement .
Anyway , it is confined to me ; different persons may have different choices accroding to their own personalities and fondness .
