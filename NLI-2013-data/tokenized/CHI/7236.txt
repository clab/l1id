When it comes to the topic of tour , there are many perspectives about the best way to have a enjoyable travel .
Some people may hold the view that it is travel in a group led by a tour guide that provides the best method .
However , as far as I am concerned , travel with friends or other acqaintences without a tour guied is a more rational chioce .

Obviously the fundamental element to decide which way to take a travel is what you want to acquire from the travel .
Do you choose to travel for the scenery , relax or business ?
The reponse is different from person to person .
However , the most possible case if for both scenery and relax .
So the tour guide accompanying the travel group might give rise to some negative effect from that degree .
Why ?
Considering you are traveling with your best friends to Paris , one of the most romantic cities in the world , it 's normal even irresitible to feel uncomfortable because there is a strange man of woman who is keeps saying besides you for the salary he or she would get from that trip .
Taking this point into consideration , I often choose to travel with my intimate friends or relatives without a tour guide for more natural and comfortable atmosphere which contributes to the enjoyment of my travel indeed .

Furthermore , it is so commen that many people who had chosen to let a tour guide arrange the travel felt very regretful for that decision .
There are many cases which are given by my friends who felt angry about the tour guides .
Some of them complained that the tour guide were ethusiastic about leading them to expensive and extravagent stores rather than illustrating the history and scene of the scenic place .
Others felt disappointed because the tour guide arranged the travel in a tight schedul which made them feel so exhausted after the trip .
Such types of complains are numerous which demonstrate the flaws and drawbacks of travel led by a tour guide .

So if we take a careful consideration of that issue , it 's not difficult to make the conclusion that the best way to travel is without a tour guide rather than with a tour guide .
