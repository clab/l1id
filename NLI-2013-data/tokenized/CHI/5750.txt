In nowadays , it is widely known that the cars bring the convenient of traffic .
We can travel some place easier and quickly .
But do those cars reduce in twenty years ?
In my opinion , cars will increase in the future .
There are several reasons I will show as following .

First of all , I think that the population is increains in the world .
In the future there are more people in the world , especially in some undeveloping and developing country .
In fact , in those country there are few cars .
Even some people have not saw the car since they were born .
Maybe it will have new kinds of traffic tools in the future .
But I think that the most important traffic tools in those country which are not developed will buy the cars in the future .
Because the prise of the cars in the future must be cheapter than today .
And those country could buy the cars in the future .

Secondly , I find that the cars is more and more cheaper .
Futhermore , the functions of the cars will improve quickly and powerfully .
Like TV , the cars will be a basic commercial in the future .
And a family may have more than one car in the futher .
So there will be more and more cars in use in the futher .
Actually , in Taiwan , many famailies have more than one car , even two .

Thirdly , the car is convenient than other transportation .
For example , the people go to work every day .
But the mass transportation does not pass the place where the people want to go .
By driving car you can go any places you want to go .
Obiviously , it is more convenient than other transportations .
And in the country , it usually does not have the mass transportation .

To sum up , I believe that the cars will increase in the futher .
From the points above , you could get why the cars are so popular and why the cars in use will grow up .
In the end , I will emphasize that the cars will be more popular in any place in the world in the future .
