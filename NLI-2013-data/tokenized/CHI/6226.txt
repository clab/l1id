I do not agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years time in the future compare to the present .
Cars will not have a lower quantity because of the ever increasing world population and rapid developement of cities .

A bigger world comunity requires more cars .
Cars are the most common means of transport .
The number of cars used would increase proportionally with the ammount of people .
This can easily be related to what I am experiencing .
My neighbour who have five family members have four cars comparing to my family who have only four members have only three cars .
An example of the increasing world population can be seen in country like India where the growth rate is still at high .
They are also converting their traditional transportation means like bicycles to cars .
In Malaysia , the goverment are having a policy to encourage more children in the family .

Secondly , many countries are trying to archive first world country status .
This will cause urbanisation to be at large hence causing cities to be bigger .
Bigger cities will be difficult to access without a car .
Freeways are also build in these countries hand in hand with the development of the cities .
This is because most government encourages the usage of cars too .
More and more cars are also available in the market now .
It can also be easily aquired in low prices .
My father told me that about 20 years ago he did not have a car and about 5 years later , he had to get one .
He says that the city is getting to big and difficult to get around relying only on public transport .

I feel that cars has become a very important part of our life and it would not be replace in mere 20 years time .
