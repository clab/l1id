Whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or being specialized in one specific subject also benefits the society .
The society requires both types of scholars to develop smoothly .
I think that being broadly trained and specialized also depends on the personnal ability .
What level you are educating is additionally a concerning issue for such consideration .

Our society needs specialists such as engineers and doctors as well as broad trained people , politicans for instance .
All of them have their special roles in the society and the society would become choatic without either of them .
Of course engineers and doctors could only be specialized in one subject as they are the experts in their fields and they should then spend all of their time on their specialized subjects .
However , for politicans , many of them are rather broadly trained in several subjects including economics , history and languages so that they would be able to know what the residents want and how to promote the policy .

A second crition on being specialized or not is depending on the personnal ability .
Some people are gifted in certain abilities they should then being specialized while some people learn several different things very quickly , they might then be broadly trained in various academic subjects .
Education and learning would be a funny process if you realize what your strengths are .

Moreover , the last but the most important reason for choosing between having broad knowledge or being specialized in one subject is what are your educating level .
If you are the primary and secondary school students , you should probably have broad knowledge instead .
A good basic knowledge in every academic subjects is essential for the choosing what subjects you would be learned deeply in the future .
You could not choose your right subjects if you do not have any knowledge in it .
Also much knowledge is based on the same basis and theory such as physics is sticked to mathematics , you could not then learn physics without knowing any mathematic equations .
If you are a college or postgraduate students , you might be specialized then .
As time is limited but knowledge is unlimited , you could not thus learn everything else in depth in such a limiting time .

Therefore there is not absolutely good to choose having broad knowledge of different academic subjects or specializing in one certain subjects , it all depends on the above critia .
Our society needs different types of people and everyone should have a right to find out any subjects they want to learn .
