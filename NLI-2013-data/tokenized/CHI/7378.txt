Travelling is one of the most popular pastime for most people .
When you dicide to have a travel , should you join in a group led by a tour guide or travelling alone ?
In my opinion , both of them have merits .

Travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself .
The guide will arrange everything for you , all you should do is just to follow his/her guide .
In addition , the member in the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others , which will make the tour more interesting and funny .
Furthermore , travelling with a group can save you some money .
For example , you can share a hotel with the your groupmember .

However , in other circumstance , travelling alone may be more suitable for you .
Firstly , travelling alone can give you more flexibility .
You do not have to follow the strick schedule made by the tour guide .
Secondly , if you do not want to be interupted by others , travelling alone may be better choice .
In addition , if you tend to go a place , where is not attractive to others , travelling alone may be the only choice for you .
Also , you can have more privacy by travelling alone .

As to me , my preference depends on where I intend to visit and how much money I plan to spend on it .
Suppose , I plan to visit a histirical place , which is relevent to my subject , and even most of people do not know it , I may have to go there alone .
On the contrary , if my destination is Yellow Stone park , I would like to join in a group , so I can communicate with other members .
In addition , the money is another factor , which can affect my decision .
On one hand , if you have enough money , I prefer to go there alone because I have more flexiblility .
On the other hand , if the buget is limited , I would like to share some costs with others , then I will choose a group to join .
