The statement about most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree about this point , I agree because this is from my experience in my life , when I saw some new product advertisement from the televioson , it always attract me , and I felt a urage from myself , I want to own that product .
I want to bacome the same as they show it on the televison , but when I saw them from the shop or when I purcheased them , I found not very effective or same as they advertise .
for example .
the shampoo , we always see the model show their hair in the advertisements , it look like a falls .
beautiful , shinning , but when you buy and use it , no doubt , toally different hair from the advertisemenrt , I think the same or similar examples are not difficult to find in your life .
so most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .
so some people will say , it is fake , it destory the rights of customer , but this is a stratege of business .
when they use some computer technique to change amd make much better than original product , it will encourage their product an oppertunity , people see their new product 's advertisement and it appeal people , then thay will go to the shop , that is an oppertunity to let the people `` feel '' their product and that can see what it is looks like , they can touch that product and thay will considear about thay willing to buy it or not .
advertisement is not a directly way to show the quanty of that product is good or not .
it just want make interested of people and appeal tham , and let them know that product , and give an oppertunity to touch and get close to their product .
this is an stratege of busniess .
