There is no doubt that nowadays the competition among people develops dramatically .
As a result , the thought is put forward that a person should acquire a broad range of skills and knowledge .
However , from the perpective of mine , I obtain that it is better to be concentrated on one certain area .

On the one hand , it is beneficial for the academic study to specilize in a subject .
The man working at a specific area is more likely to make a rather deep understanding of the subject .
For instance , an overwhelming majority of mathematicians devote a long period to computing as well as thinking about the solution of one problem day and night .
Resulting from the lengthy time which they dedicate , they are capable of detecting the answers .

On the other hand , specializing in one area does not lead to a waste of resources .
Supposing a man spends half time learning the chemistry with the other half time on biology , it is not likely for him to center on one of the subject which he studys .
As a consequence , it conducts professors of both cources to waste time of teaching .
Futhermore , the man is possible to occupy the place of lab which may lead others not be able to make a experiment .

Depite the fact above , concentrating on a specific subject perhaps give rise to some problems .
Imagine every peole purely have a study concerning one academic area , it poses the treat to scholar from varying subjects that they are n't capable of communicating with each other , due to the specialization .

From the statement discussed above , I still hold a point that it benefits us more to specialize in a certain subject .
