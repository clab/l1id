At first , I want to say : I am agree with this statrment .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This is a bid problem in the world .
We must make a solution for this problem .
We must do it now .

Why I say it is a big problem ?
Because if the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , that means they are lie .
For example , one day I saw a ad in the TV which said somenthing about a kind of medicine .
It said if you eat this medicine maybe one week you can be a real man .
Do n't worry about why you are too short , just eat this medicine , everything will be OK .
You will not lose your beautiful wife , you will not lose your friends , and also you will not lose your work .
Then a friend of mine bought a box of that medicine , because he wanted to have a try .
That medicine is very expensive , it cost about two thusand dollars .
After a week , I went to my friends home and saw him whether he is changed or not .
Unbelieve he is really changed he is even bad before he ate this medicine .
I was so sad for my friends because that medicine ca n't be used !
At last my friend is OK because we took him to the hospital .

There is another example , one day I saw a ad with a paper said there is a place sell TV and they are very cheap and used .
My TV was just broken , so I wanted to have a look .
I went there latter , the TV is very cheap you can only cost three fifth and then you can buy it .
I was so happy so I bought one .
I used it to play games and watch movies .
And then after two weeks it was broken .
I went to the company why it was broken .
The boss said he had no idea !!
I was so angry I ca n't say a word .

These are what I want to say .
Everyone must look carefully about these ad most of them are not better than they really are .
If you really want to buy one you must think a lot before you buy it .
