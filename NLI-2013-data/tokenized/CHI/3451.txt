I agree this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Here are my reasons .

First , the time of the young people is always not enough .
Resulting from the wealth , almost every student can study in schools , so they all have opportunity to make friends with peers in schools .
Hence , in their leisure time , they always have dates with their friends .
In addition , the competition of yound people is large , every students have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare exams .
Therefore , it is almost possible for them to have time help other peoples .

Second , all people , not only young people , all become colder and colder .
For instance , I have seen a young man just sit on his seat near a standing pregnent woman without helping her .
If we do n't help a person who is just surrounding us , how can we help our communities possibly ?
In addition , our education always teach us to study hard to get a famous college and compete with others .
Therefore , we are not friendly with others because everyone is possible to be our enemy .
So , we become never kind to others from our hearts .

Third , we are always unfamiliar with our heighbors .
Because everyone is busy to search for his wealthy life , he has to work hard to get high salaries or study hard to prepare to find a good job .
We never have time to drink a cup of coffee with our neighbors .
In addition , we all live in flats , so it is very hard for us to meet the people in the community .

To sum up , above s
