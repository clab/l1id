Is attend a group led by a tour guide the best way to travel ?
Different people might have different answers .
In my opinion , I totally agree that attending a group led by a tour is the best way to travel .
The reasons why I think so go as follows .

To begin with , attending a group led by a tour guide is more relex because i do not need to work hard to arrange a tour by reference many materials about the the tour such as the weather situation about the journey and what is the traffic conditions .
In addition , I do not hve to design the tour .
Finally , I do not need to drive in a long trip , completely relexing myself to enjoy the trip which led my the tour guide .
Therefore , I can save the energy and just follow the instruction of the tour .

In addition , by attending a group led by a tour guide , I have many oppertunities to make many new friends who have different backgrounds , such as coming from different areas or different countries , having different cultures .
In addition , I can enjoy the nice talk

Finally , by attending a group led by a tour guide who have many experiences about the tour , I will get a lot of knowledge and information from the knowledgeable tour guilde and from group members who have many information I have never known .

Therefore , attending a group led by a tour guide is a great idea and I like it .
