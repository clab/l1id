No one can deny the importance of knowledge .
However , to every person , no matter how clcver he or she is , it is ipossible to know everything in the world .
So most of us will face the problem to choose what to learn , and there comes the saying that it is better to have a broad knowlege of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Personally , I do n't think it a wise choice .

A broad knowlege seems to make people to look more intellegent , because whatever you talk about with him he will say `` Oh yes , I know ! `` or `` I have ever read it in a book . ''
It appears that they know everything .
Hewever does these `` Mr '' or `` Miss Know-all '' really understand what they 're saying ?
After a further disscussion you will get the answer is `` No '' .

Due to the limitation of time and energy , it is almost sure that if a person tries to learn too much acdemic subjects at a time , the result would be he can grasp none of them well .

A better way is to fosus on one specific subject .
Maybe it is a little boiling but you can learn the nature of the subject .
Specialization is what the modern sociaty asks for .
When looking for jobs , the company will ask `` What you can do '' and you are supposed to have something that can not be taken placed by others
