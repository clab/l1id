In ordinary life , we often have to face delimmatic choices , just as the statement gives rise to a debate over whether the understanding of ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
some people assert that understanding ideas and concerpts are more important for students , while other people believe that learning facts is more benefit to students .
As a matter of fact , this issue is a complex and a controversial one .
Different person will have their different choice due to their distinct background .

In my opinion , there is not a universial answer to this question , and which choce takes precedence may quite depend on the specific situation .
the final decision , nevertheless , should rely on a case - by-case analysis .

As far as I am concenrned , however , I agree that learning facts is more important .
I would like to provide evidences and gives reasons to suport my choice .
The first argument that can be presented to support my option is that real knowledge comes for practice .
I can think that there is not a better example of the idea than the obvious fact that learning swimming must make practice .
only understand idea and concepts can not grasp swimming .
to illustrate , that chemical experiments make students to learn chemistry knoweledges more better .

Although that real skill comes from learning facts is an imporant aspect , it is not the only explanation for me to choose the statement that learning facts is more useful .
the increased value places on the idea that facts are the deep understanding to the ideas and concepts .

In addition , according to my personality and experience , as well as common sense , I believe that learning facts is a better choice for students .
To be sure , it may be true that understanding ideas and concepts are useful in some condictions .
however , this is not fufficient to support to claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is too weak to strengthen the argument .

In cloclusion , based on the above mentioned reasons , which sometimes correlate with each other to make part of a larger unit , thus become more convincing than each single one of them .
So we can firmly to say learning facts is more important .
