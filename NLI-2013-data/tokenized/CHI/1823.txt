I do agree that young people enjoy life more than olders do .
Youngs are young , they have time to do what they like .
They may go to a dance hall every night shareing a wonderful time with their friend , or sleep for an entire day just because it 's comfortable .

Youngs are unexperienced , so they can try everything that they fell exciting .
They may climb trees and hills , travell across rivers and oceans to experience the glory of the naturl .
They may easily take bills that take all the money , for they got a idea to try a new thing , and then they think it 's worthy .

Youngs are confident , they will do every thing that they want to do .
They may just have a little company with a little money , and then try their best to made it gloomy .
They may also get crazy in they dreams , to be a painter , dancer , engineer or many other careers .

Youngs are never to young , if they want , they can do anything .
No matter how others are considering their behaviors and how astonishing thier behaviors are , once deiced to do that , they will never stop .

Youngs are free , they have not too much to think of .
They do not have to worry about how much money they still have , or how they get rid of the next poor days , or climbing in the rain may cause illness instead of appriciating the great natual .

So i think young people enjoys life better than the older people .
Youns are belongs to theirselves , they can do anything they like , they can choose any life style they want to
