I totally disagree the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I disagree this because I am a young people who pay enough time to helping my communty .

Why am I so sure that young people give enough time to helping their communites ?
First , I would like to say that in my university , there are numerous clubs of devoting .
I am the one of these clubs member .
We go to some retirement associations to chat with old people .
Some of them have children , but their children are too busy to go to meet them .
So we go there to acompany with them and to clean the enviroment .

Sometimes we go to meet childern who lost their parents .
Most of them are still very young , but do have enough love from family .
So we become their brothers or sisters .
We go there for teaching and giving them love .

Moreover , every students in my university must help for the community .
This is the course we must take , if we do not serving , we will not graduate .
Although some students are relunctant to do this , but after they help the community , all of them are happy and willing to do the service by volunteer .

Finally , I do not disagree that some people say we do not give enough time to helping .
Because all of the member in my clubs like to do this service .
Actually , we do not think that we are helping people , we think that we learn a lot from them .
All of my friends like to do this , and we think we are not giving .
In fact , they are really give us a lot when we helping .
