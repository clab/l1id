I believe people become richer because they work so hard , people work hard they can get more oppotunities , not only they try new things , they must do a lot research about how to lower the risks .

To set up a big company not a easy thing , a successful people in charge of all of the empolyee , all the boss had in his head are how to lower a risks , because if the boss can deal with the company , the empolyees might lose their job , the guy might not become a successful people .
people only focuse on what the successful people did , and forget to concentrate on what the people managing or marketing .

A successful engineer do a research for long time , but they must study about engineering since he was in junior high school , but people only remember he created a new technique , even though people want to try new things , they still need a lot knowledge and experience .
We can not only think about how much money the poeple earned , why they got a lot complements , we should start think about how much time they spend .

In addtion , much people take risks to do their own business , they still can earned lots of money , become a famous person , but if they can not control the risks , they might fail in one day .
Lucky are not still with the same person .

In concludsion , successful people know how to do well because they spend a lot time , maybe they still get experience from failure , they learned many things before they successed .
