In my point of view as a social worker , I disagree that it is better that people should learn and study as much and broad knowledge as they can .
Instead , I think people should specialize in one specific field .
Here are my reasons .

To begin with , each person has a special talent and habbit which he / she is perfect than others .
It is important for us to let every people excert their abilitis who only he / she has .
Take my sister as an example , my sister like play guitar very much .
But in my famiy my parents always think and put a strong emphsis on that children should spend all their time to study and it is secondary for children to learn others such playing music .
From that time , my sister always live a hard time because she did not like studying all day long and she also again and again get a bad grade .
By constant communicating with my parents , they finally knew that mabe it is a better choice letting my sisterplaying guitar instead keeping studing

In addition to person 's the special talent and habbit , efficiency is also an important thing to our society and it is important for us to let our society more efficient .

Finally , the concept about that people should kow much and broad knowledge can avoid wasting the social resources .
And then we can use the rest resources such as money to do other things .

Based above those reasons , although the opinion of that it is better that people should learn and study as much and broad knowledge as they can maybe be reasonable and understandable , I agree that people should specialize in one specific field .
