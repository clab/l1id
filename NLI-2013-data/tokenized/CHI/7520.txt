I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
First , it is very dangerous if one travels alone .
When we travel a new place , we do not know a lot about it .
We will have plenty of problems .
For example , we may get lost in the new place ; we may not found a right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day .
The first day of our travel will be full of finding , boring and tired .

Also , because if travel ina group , we could make a lot of new friends .
I like to stay with other people .
It will not make me feel frightened and alone .
When one of us in trouble during the travel , the others will help him , we stay together like a big family .
Sometimes after an interesting travel , someone could found his true love .

Finally , our travel will become more interesting if we travel in a group led by a tour guide .
The tour guide knows a lot of storise about the place which we are travelling .
He will tell us the history about the great of interest when we see it .
On the last National Day , I have a short tourist in HangZhou , I traveled alone without a tour guide .
I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had marked on it .
But I failed , I almost could not find any of them .
I have got lost on the street at last .
Fortunately , the police is very friendly , he help me to return my hotel .

I think the best wu
