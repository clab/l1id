I strongly agree with the statemet that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth .
It 's surely a way to attract more people to buy the products .
But sometimes , the products are really make clients disappointed .

For example : once a day , when I was too young , a university student knocked my room door while I was lonely in the house .
She recommanded a type of shoes were very good .
It could prevent from humid and firing .
Then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes , it did n't get firing .
Then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting , as a consequence , I bought it .
But only after some days , I found the shoes have n't good texture and destroyed by walking .
Then from this advertisements , I take a lesson : Do n't believe adversisements !
When they claim some aspects are really good and attractive , it means in other aspects , maybe are controversal .
When the claim something is high technology , maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed !

But can we prevent the advertisements from daily life ?
Certainely not .
Watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of world .
And some advertisements are too artical or storical which attact people very much .
Like microsoft 's advertisements of pentium 4 .
They tell us a new generation of computer , Though the high-technique such as computer , mobile , mp3 improving very quickly .
But they are the fashion .
And for me , I think high-technique and make-up things are toys .
They are changeable like the toys I play during my childhood .
And they can be the discussion topics .
It makes us more interesting .
Though their price are not reasonable .

Afterwords , though the advertisements always give us products not as good as they claim .
But as a daily information , we ca n't get away from them .
In a global world today , we also get benefits from advertisements .
