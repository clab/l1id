I do not agree most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
First , TV , NEWPAPER , INTERNET and so on , more and more come into our life , so we can get a lot of advertisments everyday .
In the day life , we have to buy lots things , the same thing we have so many chance , which one is better for use , which one price is better , we can not look for every store , so the advertisments give us the information . ''
OH , this one is good , has a lot of function , we shall buy this one `` We will say that after saw the advertisement .
But , if the real products is not better as advertisment , we spend time and monay , then we buy the product is not we want , what will happend next ?
We do not trust advertisements anymore .

Second , sometime , we really need the product , it is most importent to us , we bought the one after study a lot of advertisments , but you got the one was not you wanted .
If you bought it at store , you can change or return it at once , but you bought it via internet , what you can do ?
It is mean you lost a chance .

Third , that publisher or producter give people advertisements are not real products .
People are not trust you again , you will lose the market .
So I do not agree that piont .
