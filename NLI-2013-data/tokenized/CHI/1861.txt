While the senior spend most of their time just listerning to the radio or playing chess .
But do these phonmena suggest that the young people enjoy life more than older people ?
Never .

First , the young face far more pressure that the older people , both professionally and personally .
Today the commepetion in job market become more and more firece .
And aslo some of which become even more demanding .
They has to work hard to find a indeal job for themselves .
On the other hand , the pressure from personal life is aslo overwhelming , which mainly include the pressure form peers , from demaning parents .
All of this pressures make it diffilult for them to truly enjoy life .
While the older people has more opportunity to control their own life .
denefitly the older people rnjoy more in their daily life .

Second the young has more responsities to take .
THe young are the future of our socitey .
Aware of this , they even put pressure on themselves .
They have big ambition of shining , standing out .
Even additiced to video games is a sign they escape from the reality and aslo a sign that they suffer alot from life instead of enjoying it .
Tough even they themselves know they are wasting their time , they still want to give themselves a break .

In all , with all the pressure and responsibities , the younger people can never truely enjoy their life .
How can they even enjoy life more than the older people ?
