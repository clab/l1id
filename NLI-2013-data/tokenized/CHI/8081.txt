I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion , people understand ideas and concepts by learning the facts .
It seems that we are unable to get the ideas or concepts untill we really know the fatcs .

First , it is difficult for us to get the new idea or concept right away .
For instance , whenever the professors gives the new lecture , they need to organise the materials and manage to set up the lecturing in order to make students understand what they teach in class .
In fact , most professors would introduce the ideas and concepts at the beginning of the lectures , explain the details by taking some examples , and summarize the essence by the end of the lectures .
obviously , it could make students understand better , even though not all of the students stay on the same level .

Second , some ideas and concepts are really abstract , especially those mathematical issues .
we usually learn fast as long as we practise by ourselves .
for example , I still remember my mathematical teach back to primary school .
Obviously , she did great job to teach us how to undertand the classes and how to work out the questions .
One day , when we talked about the square of the objective , our teacher got a few students to stand up and measure the length and width of our classroom so that we could figure out the exact numbers of objective and caculate the square of the room immediately .
As a result , we learnt the idea and concept through the factss we did .

In conclusion , I personally believe that people hardly to understand the ideas and concepts unless they learn the facts .
Facts help us to completely understand and solve
