Every coin has two sides .
Although some people may think that successful people do what they already know how to do well , I believe that successful people try new things and take risks , as I will explain below .

The first reason why I agree with this statement is because brave is the characteristic of successful people .
There is little room to debate .
People who can takes new challenges in stride is a successful person .
For example , some inventors success since they try to create a new invention .
They need brave to experience the failure , and then research how to make a useful thing for people .
Therefore , successful people need brave to try new things and take risks .

The second reason why I agree with this statement is because the people only do what they already know how to do well may be limited to develope .
With the rapid development of society , new things appear quickly .
People contribute their knowledge ; however , some people just do the same thing .
They just want to do the things they already know .
In my opinion , it 's selfish .
For instance , when a group discuss how to make the report look impressive , some will put their best foot forward to think about that and try to make a special way , but others do n't participate the discussion .
If that , how can we make the things be better ?

Finally , based on the above discussion and analysis , I strongly believe the ideas that successful people try new things and take risks rather than onlt doing what they already know how to do well .
