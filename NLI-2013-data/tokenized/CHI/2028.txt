Young means activities , hopes , and positivities .
Young people own much more treasurs than older people .
Therefore , I think young people enjoy more beautiful life than older people do .

Firest , owning a strong and healty body , young people can do whatever they want to do .
Because of young , they do n't need worry about their condition of health .
They can do any heavy job .
May after a whole night of serious hard works , they feel a little bit tired , but after a little snap , they refresh the energy quite soon .
However , the old people are different .
They are not young ; they are always bothered by all kinds of disease .
Quite a few hard and complex jobs they ca n't fulfill .
So , that is why people get to a old age , they have to retire .

The second reason is that young people have more time than older people and they have more chance to learn new knowledge .
Because of their little age , they can live much longer than older people .
It means that they own abundant time .
By reasonablly using these time , they can study all sorts of knowledges and skills .
After successfully studying , they can find better jobs .
For example , nowadays , many young people go to school to take full time or part time courses , and after graduate , they can find a highed position from new employer for themsevles .

In addition , young people more like to accept fresh things than old people .
The thoughts of people who get to old usually change to be simple and dull .
Most of them are relativly conservative .
They refuse the new things and any improvement of the previous life .
Therefore , they are impossible to have some new ideas .

In a word , world belong to young people , hope belong to young people .
It is young people have the chance to obtain more beautiful future and create new life .
