I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because group tour imposes a lot limitation that one may not like .

First , if I travel on my own , I can set my travel duration according to my schedule and convenience .
When I travel with a group , I can only spend a certain amount of time in certain locations .
If I travel on alone , I can choose to stay longer at some of my favorite spots .
Also , I can enjoy my own daily schedule instead of complying with a group tour schedule .
In most group tours , you will have to get up early and stay up late so that you can get to as many places as possible .

Second , I will do more research to learn about the place which I will visit .
This will help me to learn the geographic location , climate , history , and culture of this place .
When I just listen to the tour guide , I tend to forget most of the information but if I do research on my own , I will retain and remember them in the future .
The place that I visit will be more memorable .

Thirdly , economically , I will be able to find economic transportation options , accommodations and even in dinning choices .
Nowadays , many can use airlines rewards to fly free or use hotel accumulated points to stay free or stay for a discount .
This will surely help to save a large sum of money .
Also , if I travel alone , I have the freedom to choose the hotel settings and locations that suit my needs .
In terms of dinning , I can enjoy eating at my time and at places that I prefer .
Food choices is a personal one .
I can surely be more adventurous if I can have my own choice .

All in all , I think that traveling on my own will give me more freedom to explore in many aspects than when I travel with a group .
Afterall when I travel , I want to be in a relaxing mode and be of myself instead of being in a crowd most of the day .
