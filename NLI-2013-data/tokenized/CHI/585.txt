People who have broad knowledge of many academic subject provide only little contribute to the world 's future compare to poeple whose specialized in on of their specific subjuct .

People who have braod knowledge on many subject seems have very strong commenscence of living becasue they know every from huge amount of study areas done in their school life .
But is someone ask them something that 's relate to one subject in very detail .
Then , these people would not be able to answer the question .
In the other hand , if some one 's good at specific area .
then the question would be answered easily with deatils and many facts .

Broad knowledge is more likely to be people studying in the high school .
They are forecd to take every subjects in order to finsih the high school and going to the college , where people learn the specific area of knowledge of what they are really interested in and willing to do things as job relate to it in the future .
The college offers great education because the task of the student is so hard and is similar to what the world is going on .
But the high school only provide the basic knowledge of the subjects .

if the broad knowlede could n't answer the hard question , that means that they have very minimal pocibility to contribute the world or even contribut to their own life .
for example , there are two people wanted to draw and greatest art in this world , one of them are only have high school eduction level , and other one has finshed the art college and actually drawing as his job .
it is definitely that people would think the one who 's mastered on drawing have the bigger chance to make the world 's greatest art piece .
And ignored the person who only can draw stick man with round head for sure .
