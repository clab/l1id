Do I agree or disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Is it widely known that prograss of technology is astonishing immensely ?
As far as I am concerned , I believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are now .
In addition , I will argue over the case with the following reasons .

First of all , I think that there will be more and more high-tech cars which will be invented in the future .
For example , when I was a child , my father always put a map in the car .
Every time we visited certain strange place , my mother would check the map , and pointed the correct direction for my father .
Now , almost every cars have a electric map .
It will automatically tell us how to arrive the place which we want to arrive .
I think that the more high-tech service cars have , the more cars people will buy .

Secondly , I find that there will be more and more roads which will be build in the future .
There are still many place without appropriate roads for cars .
However , I believe that this problem will be solve in a few years .
For instance , there are still a lot of place which Chinese government does n't develope .
But I believe that Chinese government will develope them as soon as possible .
The reasons are not only they want to decrease the disparity of wealth , but also they want to develpe their tourism .
Because there will be more and more roads will be build well , there will be more and more cars which people will want to have .

To sum up , I believe that after twenty years there will be more cars than nowaday .
Because there will be many high-tech cars will be produced , and there will be more roads will be constructed well in the future .
In the end , I will conclude my decision by emphasizing that there will be more high-tech cars which will dirve us to arrive more strange place in the future .
