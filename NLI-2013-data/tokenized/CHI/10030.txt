I agree that sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because of sucessful people think much than other people , sucessful people do n't affread fail , and sucessful people believe that high risk would get higher return .

First of all , sucessful people think much than other people .
For example , people who have a lot of ideas or think what will be happen when they are doing thing before thay take action to do things will make them more easily to resolve the problems .
These people are confident to face variable problems when they are action to do things , because they already predict they these problems may happen and they already think how to resolve these problems .

Second , sucessful people do n't affraid fail .
Sucessful people feel that fails are good expirence to make them far away doing these wrong ways again .
They can learn fail experience from doing thing fail , and they will look for new ways to recover formor wrong ways to approach sucess .
Some people give up their action when they are fall in problems and dispoint or argue that no one could give then hands .
Thes people are afraid fail and could n't learn how to become sucess from fails .

Finally , Sucessful people belive that high risk would get higher return .
People who have above two abilities will love high risk , because the two above abilities would make them have higher properbility doing high risk thing to get higher return .
They do n't do things only what they already know , and they do things in risk to get better return .
