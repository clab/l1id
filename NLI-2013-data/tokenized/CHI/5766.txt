Today , the world has grow on a rapid pace with fast development and high technology .
Through the innovatives of scientists and engineers , cars become part of our everyday life .
In my opinion , the numbers of cars would increase instead of decreasing in twenty years ' time because cars are convenient , traffic systems are improving and lack of alternatives .

On average , each house has at least two cars in my neighbourhood .
This example applies to most of the urban and sub-urban cities around the world too .
I strongly think that cars are the most convenient and easy means of travelling on roads .
Compared to motorcycle or bicylce , it is less dangerous and it could accommodate more passengers .
These qualities are equally important to the people in future whether the distance between one place to the other is short or long .
Consequently , the number of cars would easily increase .

Besides , cars are undeniably the most important vehicle in the world when it comes to travelling on road .
As countries all around the world racing to develop their traffic systems , it is proven that cars serve as the best travelling medium .
With the government working on ways to reduce traffic problems and improving the condition of roads to facilitate more cars , it is believed that the usage of cars are highly encouraged .
Therefore , more people would remain or resort to cars as their main vehicle when it comes to travelling .

In addition , there is no adequate alternatives to substitute the usage of cars .
Due the convenience and easy-accessible of cars , many would resort to cars instead of other forms of transportation .
For example , the train .
Although it is an environmental friendly type of public transport , the construction of the stations and railways would costs the government an exorbitant amount of money .
It is rather impossible to connect the whole country with train services .
Thus , cars are still the main option for the people in twenty year 's time .

Despite the forever increasing price of gas or petrol , and also the number of road accidents , in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use .
With the cooperation between the government and the people , those minor factors could be resolve while the people could enjoy fully the benefits of using cars .
