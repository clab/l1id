Nowadays , quite a few students pay attention to understand ideas and concepts in the subjects .
Other students , However focus on the facts .
As far as I am concerned , I believed that it is more important and necessary for students to understand and master ideas and concepts that they learned .
Among those countless factors , there are three conspicuous aspects as follows .

The main reason that students should understand ideas and concepts is that ideas and concepts are the basic for the subjects .
Only do students master the ideas and concepts , they could completely understand the facts .
For a example , when we understand the Newton Law , we could explain many facts that occur around us .
We know why the water would drop down and apples would fall to the ground when they are in ripe .

Another reason can be seen that student could learn and study deeply after they get to know the ideas and concepts .
Students might learn more knowledges by themselves concerning to the subject .
Because they grasp essential ideas and concepts .
It is important for students that they could learn more knowledge and explain the reason that might difficult to understand from the surface .

Furthermore , some facts are temporary and not forever .
Without understand the ideas and concepts , it is really difficult to know the truth .
Such as acid rain , which is partially caused by increasing industries .
Since we know the truth of the acid rain , people could try to control and eliminate the waste gas given from the manufactories .

In conclusion , although some facts are easy to learn , it is not solution to learn the knowledge .
When students understand the ideas and concepts , they not only could master the truth of the knowledge , but also help them to gain more ability to learn deeply .
In addition , after students understand the ideas and concepts , they might know how to take action to resolve the problems .
