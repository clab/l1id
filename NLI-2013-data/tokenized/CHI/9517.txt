I definitely agree that successful people are more willing to try new things and take more risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because they are not affraid of changing , they have more chances , and they know that you need to take risks to find new ways , they can become successful people .

First of all , successful people are not affraid of changing what they already had .
They do n't stay still and they always want something new .
Success often comes with something different from the established ones .
For example , the success of the website of youtube '' is because it 's new and unique .
Therefore , it grabs everyone 's attention .
If people always do things that they knew very well , their lives will be all the same .
Successful people are willing to try anything new and find new things that help them succeed .

Furthermore , because successful people are willing to try new things and take risks , they have more chances to succeed .
They do n't have limitations .
Therefore , they have more opportunities than those who always do the same routine things .

In addition , successful people know that every investment has its own risk and life is full of risks .
In fact , they love to roll the dice , and to see what will happen next .
That 's why life is so special .
You never know what will happen next .
It may take you to the successful life , and it may take you to the totally failure as well .
During the process of trying new things , successful people always gain some valuable experiences which help them become more successful .

To sum up , successful people are not affraid of changing their lives and are willing to try new things .
They take risks and they do n't worried about losing what they 've owned .
During these trials and errors , they always gain some experiences which make them successful in the future .
