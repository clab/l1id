Currently travel in a group led by a tour guide becomes one of successeful businesses over all the world .
But is it really best way to journey ?
I do not agree this point from my perspective .

I think travel is very personal thing to process , such as planning and preparation .
These parts are also funny things plus to `` real '' travel .
You can not have your own flexit time plan after you joint in a gourp , and even it does not need you to plan it .
For instance , if you would like to spend more days on the beach but the travel group you jointed into has already planned to visit another town .
How frustrate it is !
If you travel alonely , you can always change your mind and plan about the journey .

In addition to , from my experiences in alone journey , I would have more opportunity to meet local people and have conversation with them .
It is beneficial to understand deeper and more abour the local culture and local civilization .
Unfortunately , if you are in a travel group , you must spend most of your time conversation with your group members and miss the chance to communication even making friends with local residents .

Perhaps someone would indicates that travel with a group is convenient , but I would argue that travel alone is advantage by enjoying the feature of convenient .
Since you only need to consider you suitation not all the people in the group .
For example , I like to choose five start hotel to rest , because it will supply good and convenient condition for my vacation .
But if I am in a travel group , the tour guide must need listen to other people 's suggestion .
They may think it is so expensive that they unwilling to live in a five start hotel , or they more willing to spend money on buying things from local .
That will waste time to decide where we live .
But if I am alone , I do not need to consider so many things .
It means convenient for me .

Therefore , I would argue that advantage of the travel alone outweighs the travel in a group .
Since you will have your plan and preparation , chance to meet local people and convenient in the travel .
