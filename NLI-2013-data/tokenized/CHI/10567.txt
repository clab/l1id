I agree with the statement that successful people should try the new things even it will take risks .
As the discuss below : First of all , it is true that successful people have already had their own bussiness , and if they still engage the same bussiness , they can do them very well .
But we can not ignore the extra income of the other opportunities .
It likes why some famous companies will renew their goods again and again .
Because they know if they can creat the new goods which are better and can be accept by the clients , it will feedback much more profites than before .
So consider about these , those worries on risks are not very important .

Further more , every new taste for those successful people is means a new task in their lives .
For instance , Bill Gates , the CEO of microsoft , is very famous for his adventuresome behavior .
At first he creat the system of personal computer-DOS and Windows .
After that , he turn his sight to the interenet surfing tool-IE .
Maybe someone will hold their view for Bill Gates , but no one can ignore his ways of thinking .

At last , the value of one person also depend on the result of his career .
Many successful people have many different kinds of careers .
Those different kinds of careers was not build by one day or one time .
These people also do them one by one .
And in the end , they catch their goals one by one , just like some famous scientists , Newton , Aistance and Aidicent .

To sum up , successful people should try new things , that is why human beings can develope very quickly .
Because under every risk , it will give back more valuable things in the furture .
