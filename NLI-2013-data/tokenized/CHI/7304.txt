Nowadays , some people are obssesed with traveling alone while other people would rather enjoy a relaxed tour by a tour guide .
As far as I am concerned , I tend to hold that being led by a guide may bring more convenience and enjoyment , and I will explore some primary reasons as follow .

There is no doubt that traveling alone may seem comfortable , as you can go anywhere you want without restrictions .
Also , you will not ever never be disturbed by relatively fixed schedule as well .
Whereas , do you ever consider where to place your large amount of baggages or stuffs , and can you imagine how worse will be if you bump into some emergency , ect ?

When those things happen , you will realize that how wonderful if someone or a group of people accompanied with you and even a familiar-tour guide will lead you and other ones and always passionately offer you convenient and presice information of this journey .
Right , a tour guide will definiently assist you and you will relsease from much stress completely .

To begin with , it is not that boring or tedious when you invovle in a group led by a tour guide .
There might be shades of people who are from different places even different nations .
Thus , you have amount of time to chat with those people and share various cuturals from one another .

Secondly , there is always some emergency which is out of your way , especially far away from your hometown or homecountry .
For example , you may get sea-sick , have a bad cold or you may get lost , ect .
Accordingly , the people with you and the tour guide will certainly help you as soon as possible , say , they may provides you couples of pills to heal , even to encourage you or photo for you .
Seen this way , the assistance , undoubtful , will cushion your troublesome more .

Last but not the least , you can really be guided to those places of interest or sights which worth your going and you need not to seek on your own , and that will save your time .

All in all , I prefer being led by a tour guide as my inclination and that 's really a better way
