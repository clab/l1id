There is a common saying in the present society that the modern world is the world belonging to the young and as a result young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is just partly right .
When it comes to thinking about the statment deeply , I consider the life of older peole much better , for the simple reason that only the life they are leading live up to the discription as peaceful , joyful and hamonious .

Initially , they are really living a peaceful life .
In their late period of life , the old no longer shoulder the burden of earning money and fighting for survive .
They can choose to get far away from the center of the city where they have spent most of their life and turn to the contryside , where air is more fresher , water is much cleaner and sky is blue instead of gray .
And they can live with a lot of pets with just a little investment and be completely fused into the nature , because their life is totally without disturbance .
For example , an old man can have a pet like a bird , go to the park for a walk every morning and spend most of the day with hsi peer friends .

Another equally important point is that their life is quite joyful .
They used to be prisoner of work and life , but now they are free and become the master of life .
they can do everything they wished .
Therefore , a mass of hobbies devloped and a lot dreams created when they are young can be downright enjoyed and fullfilled now .
Taking travling all around the world as an example , a young man may found time , money and energy -- a mass of problems ---- to do so , while all that will be neglected by an older and just with an reasonable plan , the dreams is that easy to be realized .

What is more , they live in complete happiness and harmonies .
Old people get the most profit and enjoyment from a big family because the young can not experience the feeling of looking at their offsprings ' growth and share their offspings ' successes .
If you are still a youth , you will not now how happy an older people when he or she received a care or bless from his or her children ---- something that nothing can compare .

Admittedly , the young do have their advantages .
They may have passion , enthusiasim and a mass of energy that the old do not poccess .
However , in view with all the merits of the older people 's life , I really have my envy for their life which is that peaceful , joyful and full of happiness and harmonies and as a result , I will no longer being afraid of growing old .
