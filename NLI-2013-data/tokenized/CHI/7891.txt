Which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a guide ?
I think it depands on where you are traveling to .
If I will take a trip in a famous city with several wel-known gardens and lots of special products , I will choose a group led by tour guide .
It 's convenience to visite the city and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bus and the guide will give many details on the history of the gardens .
And the tickets will be cheaper than if i buy them seperately cause those tour guides always have group discount .
I might have to buy some products in some perticular tourist stores that the tour guide leeds me into , but I might also get into those stores and get fooled even without a tour guide .
Do n't laugh at me as that is the realy experience myself in Hangzhou .
I visited Hangzhou 2 months ago all alone .
But I took a taxi to Longjing Moutain where the famous villige producted green tea located and bought some tea in high price just like all tourists did in group .
As I would did so anyway , why should n't I join a tour group and travel easily there ?

If taking trovel to some places like tibet , I will go without a tour guide .
The purpose to such places is to experience how is the life of people there .
You will not really experience it if you are in a group .
The only way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot .
To live as you are one of the local people .
How can you really know the live there when a tour bus is waiting for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mates are talking about eveything the see around you ?

There is no a best way to travel , but planning what knid of travel you are making and then you can choose if you need to be in a group led by a tour guide .
You can always travel in a better way .
