Different people have different answers to this statement .
It depends on the person 's personality , perferences and characters .
Those people who have more working experiences will think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I hold this view point too .

First of all , companies hair many movie stars , famous singers , as well as those politicans to sing high praise for the products .
Consumers will think the products will as good as those stars , because they wo n't hire those unfimilar people to the mass .
But actually , will those products ' quality is as good as those stars ?
I think most of the time the answer is no .
We should judge the products quality by experient or by our experience .

Second , most advertisements use a lot of fancy method to attract consumers .
They use television , radio , magazines , newspapers and internet to attract them .
These kind of mass media can give the reader more colorful and lively demonstrations .
It exceed the original products and give the consumer the fake idea .

Third , most advertisments express their ideas with too much good words .
We all have the experience that we were introduced a kind of products by the advertisments that their products is the best in all of the same products , their products can be uses more than 100 years , the car they sold is the cheapest .
But what is the truth , maybe it is a very bad product .
