I agree with this statement .
the people who want to be successful must do something speciall .
you ca n't just stay there and keep the thing you have already known .
The most important thing for a successful people is creative , you must do something that nobody did it before .
for example , at the early of the national basketball assosiation ( NBA ) , that time , every plyer all shoot without the jumping , i do n't know why they did n't shoot with the jump , maybe just because nobody thought about it , they all just stayed there in that little circle .
Then on day , somebody suddenly thought about it , why we ca n't shoot with jumping ?
If we jump , it hleps to close the hoop , and it also helps improve the shooting point , it 's harder to be blocked .
So , this person began to practice the jump shooting , and then he became a very good basketball player that time .
This is the story that really easy to see , why successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know .
That player could just practice no jump shooting and became a good player , but he tried something new , and he changed basketball history .

i think `` try new things '' is a very important skill for a successful person , nobody can be successful without this skill .
when you learnning something , you just stay where you are , do n't go to blaze a new area , you are still just same as other people , you will never be successful .

Trying do something new is not that easy , when all the people doing same thing , only yourself against them or do something different , sometimes you will ask yourself are you doing the right things ?
But it must cost you something to be successful , you must do something different so you can be successful , do n't be normal as them , trying do something new .
