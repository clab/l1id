Are most advertisements can make products more attrctive and better when they are advertised ?
To some extent , I agree with the author 's general assertion that some advertisements do have some positive effects on consumers ' impressions on products but only through advertising cannot necessarily make products seem much better .
However , the author unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to an irreversible extreme while overlooks some essential factors .
On balance , My points of contention involve the fundamental and deep analysis as discussed below .

On the one hand , I would like to admit that the author 's statement , although suffers from some obivous drawbacks , has some merits primarily in some special cases in which the implicit rationale behind it accords with common sense and our experiences in daily life .
Hence , it is partially correct .
In the first place , I want to point out that advertisements can have positive effects on consumers ' recognition of certain product .
Since clients tend to accept the fact that only firms producing superior products will advertise their products because only those firms can make ends meet or even profit greatly through advertising .
It is true that marketing a product through advertising means investing a lot of money and a firm cannot know in advance whether these advertisements will be useful to the success of a product .
Hence , advertising is a high-risk investment and only big firms are appealed to advertise their products .
For instance , Microsoft Co. or Coca Cola Co. often advertise their new products through all types of media .
This phenomenon makes consumers think that advertised products are good in quality , however , which is often not the case .

Further more , advertisements tend to overstate the quality of a product .
Some words used in advertisements will elaborate the attractiveness of a product and will be unwillingly to admit the defects of a product .
Consequently , consumers who watch advertisements will aptly think that the product described in the advertisement is very good in quality although in reality this product is not so good .

On the other hand , recognizing that a more applicable should incorporate different aspects of the issue as sufficient as possible , I have to point out that the author overlooks some compelling factors that may affect this issue .
In short , this statement is problematic in some ways .
For example , some products do have the same quality as presented in advertisements .

In conclusion , issue of whether advertisements make products seem much more superior than they really are is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment .
Consequently , there are no easy or certain answers .
So different are the personal experiences and emotional concerns among people with diverse cultures that thousand individuals might hold thousand opinions .
According to me , some advertisements do have some positive effects on consumers ' impressions on products therefore can make these products more attractive .
