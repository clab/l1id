I feel that I do n't agree with this statement .

First , The number of developing country is much larger than the number of developed country in the earth .
Mang people in developing country wil be richer and richer .
So they will buy their own cars in the furture .
J ust like China .
Because I am from China , I know much more about the people in developing country .
In China , the economy is much better than twenty years ago .
The number of cars is creased so fast in these years .
More and more people are talking about the plan of buying a new car now .
It has already been an important part in people 's life .

Second , in my opinion , the number of cars in developed is full now .
Almost everybody has their own car , and some people even have two .
But it do not means that the number will decrease .
In twenty years , people will update their cars more morden .
But do not reduce the number of cars .
So it will lead that the number is no changed obviously .

Third , although mang country 's government begin to limit the number of cars because of the pollution .
But I believe that the producers of car can find another way to avoid its happen .
They can find out another energy to instead of oil .
Just like gas , electricity , and so on .
Maybe there will be more and more cars using this kind of energy in the roads .
I think this is also our dream .

Finaly , producing a car can improve the technology in many fields .
We have no rights to stops it .
Having a beautiful car is also my dream .
