People hold different opinions of whether or not young people enjoy life more that older people do .
One may claim that young people can enjoy life more since they have more energy .
However , i will argue that people can enjoy life equally , both the youngs and the elders .

The first reason in support of my view is that people have equal right in terms of enjoying life .
Nowadays , numerous games and activities tends to become suitable to people at any ages .
Traveling would be a perfect example to prove my argument .
More and more travel agencies provide different trips and vacations regarding to the differences of ages .
Elder people can join and group for seniors , likewise , youngsters can participate one designed for their age .

Second of all , people enjoy life in the same level although they may do activities in different ways .
The acitivities that young people like to do , such as video games or extreme sports , the seniors may not enjoy doing .
Instead , they may like prefer doing other things , like gardening or cooking .
However , there is no definition that tell people which games are more fascinating or which activities are tedious .
When it come to how to enjoy life , it more likely to depend on different people .

last but not least , some people may argue that the people are more energitic to do more activities .
In my point of view , due to the amazing developments of modern medicines and health care , the elders are in better healthy conditions which provide them to enjoy some highly active sports as well .
The man , who is in his seventies , go to swim everyday in the morning .
I believe some young people even cannot keep this everyday routin .
The youngs may not have interest on it , or they even do n't have sufficient time to do it as some older people .

In conclusion , i am highly convinced that both the youngs and the olders enjoy life equally since they have the same rights , although they may enjoy life by participating different activities .
Besides , the contribution of the medical science on seniors health also increases the opportunies to do more activities for them
