I disgree with the point that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Of course , no doubt understanding ideas and concept is very important .
We need to apply ideas and concepts to reality .
Ideas and concepts are basic stuff .
But it is a littile bit haste to conclude this result that understanding ideas and concepts is more important .

The objective of understanding ideas and concepts is to practice .
Then the practice yields many facts .
I think no idea and concept is perfect which is alway impeccable .
Though learning the facts , we can complement ideas and concepts .
Take an organic chemistry lab for example .
Absorbance of the solution .
At first , we must look at the manual of the lab and grasp the principle of the lab .
Then we began to do the lab .
Sometimes we found it was not true that the absorbance was proportional to the concentration .
It seemed against the rule .
That was a fact .
We need to find the real reason leading to the result .
Last we found absorbance was affected by many factors .
Temperture and humity can control the result .

Ideas and concepts are very deep and hard to understand which are forgotten quickly .
By facts , we often easily understand ideas and concepts .
Facts are vidid .
Most students are tired of lot of study .
Facing to textbooks is a hard thing for a long time .
But facts give us a direct feeling which inspire our interest and imagination .
Sometimes it is amazing that we grasp ideas and concepts so easily and quickly .

And many new inventions are generated by facts .
For instance Newton Principle .
If Newton did not see the process of falling down the apple , Newton Principle will not exist .

We do not deny the importance of understanding ideas and concepts which is most basic .
If we do not understand ideas and concepts , we can not learn anything from facts .
Facts , ideas and concepts are indispensible .
If we can do well by them together , we will do better .
