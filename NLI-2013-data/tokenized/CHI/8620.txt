I disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .
There are several reasons to explain my point .
First of all , I believe that it is necessary for students to learn facts first , which will help them to grasp knowledge and make them get a sense of feeling of what they 've known about the world around them and help them to perceive their own ideas .
Ontology and epistomology are the basic elements for human beings to understand the world and the reality .
It is especially important for students to learn facts .

Secondly , I think it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and learn facts .
As ideas and concepts are coming from the facts that leart , they are correlated with each other .
Students cannot fully grasp the ideas or concepts if they lack basic knowledge of facts , on the contrary , facts are meaningless if ideas and concepts could not be understood .
For instance , the idea that hungry cats will more porbably catch moving objectives like birds and mise than the ones that are full could be fully understood only if students got an idea that cats prefer mise and birds as their food , which is the common sense .

Thirdly , understanding facts will better enable students to grasp ideas and concepts and help them to put the idea and concepts into practice .
Take another example to illustrate this view , the fact that people will fail down easily on an icy road will help students better konw the ideas that it should be careful to walk on an icy road , and the experiment that erosion will decrease the possiblity of failing down and spliting salt water will increase the melting time of ice will make people carry these concepts out in reality so that the road will be much safer to walk on .

In short , it is in a rush to say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than for them to learn facts .
From the analysis above , we may conclude that understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are interacting with each other and hold the idea of they are equally important will help us better understand the reality and the world around us .
