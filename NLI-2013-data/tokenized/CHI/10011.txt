Presently , so many people hold opionion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experiense , life style and emotional evention .
However some peole do n't .
They hold opinopn that sucessful people would try news things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
And each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages .
From ma personal pespective , i would prefer the second opinion .

first of all , doing what they already know how to do well is more safe do get suceed , however , it may also make you lose something that may even more important .
Since it is a world of changing , everything is changing in every minute , if you are only do what you already konw at your times , you may fall behind the times .
So its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages .

the most vantial benefit of my opinion is that trying nes things and taking risks may lead you get more experience in the changing worlding , you may never lose any information .
And that is what the first opinion would never achive .

What 's more the advanges of the my opinion is bigger than its diaadvantages .
So many people would think there are too many risks during trying new things and it may lead you lose more .
However , the more risks you get , the bigger suseed you recieve and that is the different between successful people and nomal people .
But sucessful people are not those taking risks blindly , they would think several times they should do it or not until it is possible for them to do it .

After understanding , the reasoning above , it is quite safe now to say ,
