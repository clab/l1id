I think people usually buy products because of attractive advertisement .
But most products are worse than sample on the advertisement .
Therefore , I agree with the topic -- most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First of all , salers always tell customers how great the products are .
They can make a magic story to show how products work .
For example , one time I went to a cusmetic store , and the clerk told me their product was good , it could make my skin better .
After I used it for a week , I did n't think so .
It was not useful , and it was very expensive .
I was really angry about that .

Second , advertisement companies know how to design the product and advertisement to attract people .
In addition , they know how to persude the customers and make many programs , such as buy one get one , or coupons .
For instance , those programs usually attract women and teenagers .
But they always regret after they bought those products .

Third , advertisement companies usually make a survey to understand what kind of products will be popular .
And they try to make a perfect product in a reasonable price on the advertisement .
When customers see the advertisement , or hear from their friends or co-workers , they will rush to buy without thinking .

In my opinion , I usually think twice before I buy something .
It is necessary to consider about that .
As I have many experiences , I do n't want to waste money on those unuseful things anymore .
Now , if I really want to buy something , I always ask my friends or look up information on the internet .
Salers just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantages of their products , and after you bought it , you will find out how terrible it is .
Therefore , I support the idea -- most products seem better on the advertisement than they really are .
