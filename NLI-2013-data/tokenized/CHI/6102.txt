I do think that there will be few cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because we do not have enough resources as petrolem and our environment can not stand for the pollution for another twenty years .
Although car is convenient , it is not a good vehicle of transportation because we have already pay much price on it .

The most significant reason I think that the use rates of cars will reduce in twenty years is we will lack of the resources pretty soon .
Since car has been invented and the industrial revolution , the natural resources of petrolem become needed than ever .
However , it takes time for petrolem to be mature but we ignore this fact for a long period because we can not not live without it .
Nowadays , almost every family has at least one car and the demand of the industry cause the petrolem reduce faster than it can grown .
This kind of natural resources can hardly be fixed and last forever once it has been used out .
The car amount will decay because it is not easy to find a replacable resource to cover and our environment can not take the side effect that came along with the pollution .

Bscause of the humenbeings , earth has suffered for a long time because of the pollution .
In brief , our main concerned now is to reduce the amount of cars .
If we do not take it seriously , the disaster came with the industry activities will rullin every creature that live on the world .
Air pollution , water pollution and all these kind of issues should be protected immediately .

I think the amount of cars will be fewer in use in twenty years than there are today .
The two major reasons that make it occur is the lack of natural resources and the pollutions .
We need to take action as soon as possible not only because we do not have energy to drive our car but because we do not want to drive the car .
This is a kind of action that protect the environment in a most effective way .
