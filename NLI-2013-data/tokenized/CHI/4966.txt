I agree this statement .
In moderm time , advertisements for products is a very important marketing statege .
The industries want have a good sale on their products , then they need to make attracive advertiseings to consumer .
Therefore , most of them were made over to show its product quality that they really have .
I make some examples to support my opinion .

First , they are over imagination on advertisements .
Like some liquard products advertisements , we can see offen on the TV .
In a pretty hot day , you get a cool drink and drink it , and then you will feel the weather becomeing cold and forget the deady hot weather .
I think this will not really happen when anyone drink the prioduct .
they will never say what is not good for human , like soda , if you drink it everyday instead of water , you will gain weight a lot and also will cause some disease for body .

Second , it is not ture for the products on advertisements , I remember I have seen a comercial is about battery .
They put their product into a robert and compare another unknowen company 's product which put into a same robert too , and then they test which battery can keep more time to let the robert move .
After this , I have bought the company 's products and used , but I did n't recoginze what is really big different with other brands .
Not all the advertisements tell the real turth that their product is .

Next , they make everyone seems want to purchase their products .
Like some advertisements show people want to take the last staff make a long line or even fight to each other for this staff .
It make consumer confuse that this product is every important for them , so we have hurry to buy it early or you ca n't buy it anymore .
There is overshow why this product we really need it .
We need more information to support this product is we real want or not .
