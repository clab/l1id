With the development of the society , more and more people started to pay attention to how to success and what successful people usually do .
Recently , the issue whether the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well has been brought into focus .
When it comes to this question , the majority people think the successful people can be successful because the new things give them a lot oppotunities .
However , others regard doing what you do well as a better choice .

As far as I am concerned , the successful people like to do what they do well .

To begin with , successful people do what they do well will give them more chances to be successful .
When you do something a lot , you will recognize it more details .
You will know why it works like that , and how it works , so when you met some problems , you do n't need to worry about it .
You can solve it yourself .
And you can do it better than others .
All of this will give you more oppotunities to success .
One of my friends do the things what he is familiar with all the time , although he spent a lot time on it , he successful because of it .
He does this better than others , the things he made is low price and hige quality .
So a lot of people like to choose his product .

Aslo , successful people like to do the things what they know how to do well because they will have less risks .
Most of the people do n't want to take more risks in today 's world .
The risks may give them much pressure , and may let them lost everything they have .
However , by doing the things what they know how to do well will be safer and aslo can earn lots of money .
There are many people try to do new thing , whereas most of them ca n't success and lose what they have before .
So these examples tells us we should do something we know it well .

Although , there are many advantages of doing familiar things mentioned above , trying new things also has its own benifits .
Nevertheless , Jundging from all the evidence offered , we aslo can draw a conclusion that successful people prefer to doing what they already know how to do well .
