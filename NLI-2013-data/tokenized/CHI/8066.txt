With the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .
Consequently , few people nowadays think it is more vital for students to understand ideas and concerts .
On the other hand , there still some people who think learn the facts is more important .
In my point of view , whether to choose or not is not a critical matter , and personal preference should be respected .
After consider my personality and the fondness .
I will choose the latter one and list the reasons as follow .

The first arguement that can be presented to develop my idea is that learning the facts may make students understand the ideas and concepts more easily .
Both common sense and our experience have informed us that learning fact may provide a more general and clear view .
A good example could give some light to this point .
As the students learning fact through the real example may give them a more specific and detail of the general idea of the thing .
Moreover , opposite example can be found to demonstrate that students understrand the ideas and concepts may not know how to use them into the real life , such as the learn the theory on the class and do not know how to use it into the real experience , so there is no meaning to learn it as students do not use it .

In addition , it is easily obseved in modern soceity that learning the fact my be more effective .
It is obvious that student studing by learning the fact may be more effective as they can get the general idea from the fact .
To illustrative this there is an example that is very persuasive .
Students learning through facts which may more impress them than just let them understand the concepts , so they may learn it more effective and do not just learn the idea from the book , learn the facts are more interesting student to memonrise it .

Nevertheless , students understand ideas and concepts also have advantages to some extent , they can know the basic idea of the thing which may give them a direction to solve thing .
However , such merit is speculative , what is more if you can see that not everyone can understand it deeply and use it .
Therefore , learning the facts is more important .

In these circumstances , after close comparision between the learing the facts and understand ideas and concepts , it is not difficult to draw the conclution that it is crucial for students to learn the fact rather than understand ideas and concepts .
