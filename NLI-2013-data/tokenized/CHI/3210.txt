I totally agree with the statement that the young people today really do n't spend enough time helping their communities .
And that is also what I do n't want to see and expect .
In the following disscusion , I will present the reasons which cause the result and how to solve the problem .

The first reason why the young people today do n't give time to help their communities is that there are more and more things attract them .
When the young students are after class , they may do some activities with their friends such as shoping or something like that .
The beautiful clothes in the department stores or the popular video games in the club may attract them .
That means that they will pay more attention on what they like and spend more time on what they are intereted in .
So that is why the young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are lots of things they want .
It makes sence that they may forget some other important things such as the communities stuff .

The second reason is that the most young people tend to take the material they have for granted .
They do not appreciate it because they think that they deserve it .
So maybe they will think that the communities stuff is not their business and they do n't have to take the responsibility for it .

Toward this problem , I think the best solution is education .
We have to teach the young people about their duty of helping their communities .
A good community is based on many people 's effort .
We have to let them know that they are also the part of the communities .
So they should spend enough time toward it no matter what reasons they have .
To be more specific , let me give an example to explain more clearly .
Each of us all belongs to a family .
So who should spend time on the household things .
I think that you will say each member in the family should spend time on them .
And that is what I want to say .
Just like this example , each member in the community should give enough time to help their communities because they are the members in the communities .

T sum up , I agree that in today 's society , young people really spend less time to help the communities .
And the reasons why is just like what I mention above .
What we can do is try our best to teach them about the importance of the participation in the communities .
