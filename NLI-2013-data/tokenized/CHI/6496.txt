Everyday I leave my house for school , I see a car .
I see many cars .
As a matter of fact , i nearly get hit by many cars .
They have become as much a part of my life as food .
Also like food , I forsee much , much more of them in the future , and for much the same reason .
People like food .
People want more food .
Therefore , they are going to make more of it .

Some believe that cars will lessen out in the next two decades due to new , cheaper means of transportation , such as the segway or aurplances .
However , virtually every household in America possesses at least one such vehicle , often two .
I do n't think people are going to throw away their beloved sedan simply because someone recently invented a new fancy toy that rolls on two wheels and requires no gas .
They simply put too much money into their cars , spent too much time with them , to throw them away for the next new fad .
When the cars break own , they 'll probably jsut buy a new one instead of giving a new invention a try , since they prefer familiarity over the unknown .

People often complain about how cars create pollution , with all the fuels they burn , the exhaust they produce , and all the wasted metal when they break down or outlive themselves .
Despite all of this , people still buy hondas , BMWs , and ferraris like crazy .
People do n't care about the polution problem enough to quit driving and take up biking , and major car companies squish their fears by insisting that they are producing more efficent , cleaner cars even as they speak .
Therefore , I believe it 's safe to conclude that the number of cars will actually rise within twenty years , not drop .

As gasoline prices have shot up , the number of people buying cars have dropped slightly , but not by enough for anyone to really notice .
As the demand for motor oil increases , so will the number of enterprises that go out searching for the stuff .
Thus , if anything , the oil supply will increase in twenty years .
Even if they fail to find anymore gasoline resveres , the car companies will most likely develop cars that run off other fuels , such as hydrogen , fuel cells , or simply electricity .
As the fuel gets cheap , so will the cars .
As the cars get cheaper , peopel start buying more .

Cars will not lessen within the next twenty years , unless they invent a new vehicle that makes the beloved automobile obselete .
People simply love their cars to much to care about how neat the newest invention is , or how much pollution it generates , or how much gasoline prices have rised .
