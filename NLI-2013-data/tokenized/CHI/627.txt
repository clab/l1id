Ever consider that what the world will look like if there is no expert on medicine , computer sciece and engeers ?
Why would a company hire someone if he or she just have a general knowledge or without certain special skills ?
Can you imagine the rapid development of morden sciecen and technology whithout specialized knowledge ?
I really believe that people should have sbjects in specialized field .

Firstly , mordern society need a proper distribution of worker groups that have special skills and serve as special purpurses .
In fact it is the experts from differen areas that give us the life facilities .
If all the people have a general knowledge in our society , there will be specialized madical services , convenient trasport system .

Secondly , it will be very helpful for people to get a job if he have been trained in special areas .
Certain companies deal with certain issues concerned with our life .
If you have a very deep and specialized skills , you are more likely to be heired by a company .
On the other hand , if all the people have the same trainning with the same background knowledge , it is hard to say that company will benefit from their stuffs ' comman performance .

Finally , the constant accumulation of knowledge of certain specialty need the constant effort that experts have to contribute .
Every single acdemic specialty need new improvement of its own .
If every one have the same background , it is hard to believe that science will be going on .
In fact , knowladge of special field brings a much deep understanding of certain area .

However , people should , in some distance , have a general information about what the whole world is like .
A general knowledge will cast some ideas to special area .
For example , biologists get the concept of computing the huge information presentede by thousands of billions of DNA code .
And also , a broader interesting about the world will give people a more freer and opener mind .
But if we caculate the whole advantages of speicial subject , I would claim that special trainings should be obtained , only for the benefit of the society and ourselves .
