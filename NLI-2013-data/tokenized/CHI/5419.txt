This world is dazzling , various yet institutionalized .
Some compays use advertisements to illustrate and attract customers to buy their product .
However , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In order to get people 's attention , advertisements always use some special cases which might not be suitable for every samples .
Comercially , it is the primary goal to get the benifity , wich make the experiment results showing in advertisements are more like a story instead of an academic strictly paper report .
Some advisements will even provide inaccurate experiment data in their product and bambast for them .
This situation is much more serious in most of Asian countries because of their goverment 's careless attitude for popular media .
Take one notorious case for example , Chai-Ca , one of famous communication IC design campanys in Taiwan have ever proposed a cell phone called Nan-Chi .

In the beginning , Nan-Chi was so popular because that the advertisement meantioned it can still work in some rural areas even the density of signal base is sparse .
However , that kind of assumption will only work in east part of Taiwan because of the specail reason .

In conclusion , I highly aggree with the statement that most advertisements will make products seem much better than what they really are in view of the advertisement I have ever watched .
And it is really necessary for goverments to face , handle and make the related law to this probelm .
