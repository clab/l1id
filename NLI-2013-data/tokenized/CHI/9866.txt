Some of the people think that successful people must have to try new things rather than only doing what that already know how to do well .
In fact , people who want to try new things must have to bear the risks .
However , without trying new things , things wo n't be improved or invented by themselves , and there will be no successful then .
So I agree with this statement .
In this essay , I will argue in favor of this statement and give some examples to support my opinions .

Firstly , if people never try new things , but only doing what they already know how to do well , they wo n't know that there 's can be a change or improvement .
Since things wo n't be improved or invented by themselves , and without trying the new things , people are just like sitting at the same place or same level .
Thus , they wo n't be succeed .

Secondly , if people only doing what they already know how to do well , it wo n't bring out a change to improve the situation .
Since people are only repeating and repeating the same works that they used to do very well , there 's no change in their lives .
So , It 's also believed that they wo n't be succeed since there 's no change .

Lastly , although people who try new things need to take the risks , it helps to improve their works and lives effectively .
With such an improvement , people have opportunity to be succeed and go to a higher level rather than staying at the same place and have no improvement or change .
So people who try new things helps them to be succeed , In a conclusion , It 's believed that successful people need to try new things and make their lives different .
With such a differ , people will know there are something they can do to improve or change .
So as to make their lives become better and more comfortable than before .
