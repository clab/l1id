Understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts , thats two different ways of leaning new things , but which one is more important may lead people discuss about it .
In my opinion , to understand ideas and concepts is more improtant for students than just learn facts .
Becuse many problem-solving are based on the ideas , concepts or theorie .

Firstly , when students understand a idea or a concepts , they can use what they know to apply to viours of situation , to analyze the problem , to think of them and solve them .
Many things happen in the world are based on some theories , such as how a object moves , why some times computer do not work etc .
For example , when a car is designed , engineers need to follow the rules of physics , and chemistry .
However , when engineers know the theories of the dynamic , they can use same theories to appliy to other manufactures such as ships , planes and so on .
In contrast if students only know the fact that a car can move in this way but do not know why , they can not deal with other problems , because they only know the facts , but reasons .

Secondly , facts are only restricted in few aspects .
Students who learn facts are usually can not analyze some situations indeed .
Students know what are happening on some things , they know the appearence , but they might not know why that is happened .
Sometimes they might know the reasons that course the condition happened , but because there are not ideas and concepts in students mind , they would not understand the reasons fully , they can not analyze correctly , therefor they might not solve the problem , the problem is still on there .

To sum up , in my opinion , to understand ideas and concepts is more important for student them to learn facts , as i mention be
