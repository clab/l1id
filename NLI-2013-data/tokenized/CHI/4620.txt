I agree with the statement
a stratege of promoting products
a way of attracting customers from existing market

As we are in the twenty-first century , we are facing more challenge in promoting our products to occupy the market than before , more especially the new products .
Therefore , manufacturers as well as retailers must find an efficient way to sell the products .
Advertisement is the very important way to introduct the products to the market .

There is a marketing department in every successful company to promote the products or services to existing customers as well as potential ones .
Take cell phone company as an example , in US , we have Verizon , T-mobile , Singular etc .
Thus , their advertisements are really play critical roles in attracting more customers .
So there are famous sentences such as : `` raising the bar '' , `` the best network follows you '' or `` get more minutes '' and so on .
Cellphones serve the function of our communication , so I think those advertisements do not describe the real functions of their products , in other words , it is a kind of exaggerating .

We have more products to compare and to choose in the limited market .
I still take cellphone as an example , we can not use more than one cellphone in our life .
We make our choice according to the advertisements of those cellphone companies or the recommendation of our friends .
I signed my contract with Verizon simply because they advertised their family plan .
As a matter of fact , the `` best network follows you '' sometimes did not work out in my situation .
In certain area or in the moving car , I experienced bad signal problem .

To sum up , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to survive in the competitive society .
As a consumer , we should protect ourselves by purchasing rationally .
