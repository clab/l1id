In the contemporary society , it seems certain that some people have formed a unrealistic picture on the problem concerning about the cars .
They considers that the car will be fewer in our future life .
They asset that along with the boom of the cars has come more serious probelms like air polution and enengy crisis .
However , from the informations I have collected in the past few years , nothing is further from the truth than it .
It 's no doubt that the car , one of the main transpotation in our society , will still play a dominent role in our future life .

First and foremost , the car stands for the development of a country .
The changes of the cars represent the changes of a country .
As is well known , China is a develpping country .
You could see few cars with few brands on the street in the last twenty years .
However , with the enhancement of our comperhensive nation power , many family has their own cars .
The number of cars are increasing as a eye-dazzling rate in our country .
We could easily conclude that there will be more car in each of our cities with the development of our country .

In the second place , the car will take place the pubilc transportation in the future .
Blessed with the convenience and high efficiency , the car could meet people higher demand in their daily life .
For instance , not only could people drive their own cars to work in each business day , but also they could arrange their vacation schedule by driving their car .
It 's no need for them to spend their timetable on pubilc transportation .

Last but not the least , variety cars will be made in this high technology society , such as the energy-saving cars , sunpower engning cars , to name just a few , which make it possible for people to save remnant energy and avoid the air pollution .

From what has been presented previously , we could safely draw a chonclusion that car will take beneficial moreeffects into our living standard , to our country , even to the society .
We should hold a positive attitude towards car which allow it bring its initiative into full play .
