I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
Maybe some young people had done enough , but in average level , it 's true that most of young people use their time in play and enjoy their living time .

I think there are some bad condition for the young people in-correct attitude and concept .
They think it 's not concern with them .
Maybe they have much more important things need to do and share their times , so they consider they are very bussy , so they ar n't willing to pay more time to helping their communities .

I thinkthe best solution that need family , school and society share the duty to change young people 's concept and attitude .
So parents , teachers and government officers need work hard and corporate from now on .
Include study and education , let young people why they need pay more attention and time to helping their communities and let they know they have duty to keep this work continuly , when one day they marry and there are chilkdren , they need transfer this concept to their children all of their life .
So make sure this world will keeping opportunity and enough power to helping t and keep their communities .
Of course , the government officers can use TV , newspaper and so on to open enough messages about who to helping communities .
So most of young people are willing to handle and share enough duty to do it .

At one word , All of people include younger and elder people , there are the same duty to keep and helping their their communities , so all of human there are more high quality community lever and society can grow up and implement every century and all over the world continuly and forever .
Bless the human can get best communities for everyone
