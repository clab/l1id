I agree with that students should understand ideas more than facts .
With the development of technology , more and more people pay their attention on learning knowleged .
But which is a correct and effective way to learn knowledge ?
Some people may think that learn the fact is much better than learn from books , but actually they are totally wrong .
Since if you want to understand a thing , the only way is to understand the concepts and ideas .

First of all , learning ideas is a system and logical study .
It is going to help people learn a thing very logically and effeciency .
For example , when you face a big problem , the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it .
These processes are all based on the understand of ideas .
To imagine that you do not even know what is the idea , how can you solve it ?
Obviously , the ideas are more important than the faces .

Secondly , the ideas and concepts can help students to see deep part of a thing .
When you know the fact , you may think it is right or wrong from your point of view , but actually that 's may not true .
At this time , you need to know the ideas , the idea can help you to analysis the thing , and make you really understand what is that mean or how things work , that 's really very important .
A really understand is not mean you know the facts , acutally is the concepts .

Thirdly , learning of the idea is very essential and useful .
Actually the idea is the main part of learning a thing , only if you understand what is the idea of it , then you can study it .
For instance , when I read a book , first of all I need to know the concept of it and then I will read it and know the entire book spontaneously .
So it is easy to see that an idea is very important even in our daily life .

To sum of , the most improtant thing for a student to learn is the idea and concept .
It will help you to understand a thing very logic and deep , more than just know the fact .
