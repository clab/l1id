I agree with the statement , `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''

If we have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we would be able to `` think out of the box '' when coming to conversations with other people who are may not be related to your one specific subject .
It will also be and advantage to us if we have a broad knowledge over many academic subjects when we are applying for jobs , making a decision in our future or maybe it will even help us to meet and make new friends .

If we are only specialize in one specific subject , the job which we can be applying or be doing would be limited .
For example , if we are having a discussion with our old schoolmates , naturally not everyone would be studying or working on the same subject or carrear .
So if we only have a knowledge of only one specific subject , then we may not be able to join in a conversation , and we might be completely lost .

I think that if we have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , other people would think that you are a more intellegent , even you may not be good or perfect at each and everyone of the subject , you would at least know the basics of it and it will be a lot better than people who are really good at one particular subject .

We may be better than others , in that one particular subject , that we hae knowledge in , we may not be as good and as useful from others point of view comparing to the people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Therefore I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
