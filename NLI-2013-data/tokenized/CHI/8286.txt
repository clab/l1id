The teachers teach us alof of different things .
They always teach us that to understanding the idea and the concepts of each article is more important than to learn the facts .
Even thought we are the students or the teachers .

First , understanding to ideas and the concepts is to make sure that you know everything of this story or article .
If you do not understand what it talk about , you would never get the the fact of it .
My English teacher always says that way to me .
If we want to learn the good English , we should read it more than one time to understand the idea .
It likes the chacater , setting , plot , and the background .
When we can get all of the above , we would understand the ideas and the concepts .
Trying to read it more than one time , it would more easy to get what it says in the reading .
I always do that way , because I want to get higher marks of every test or quiz .
When we do that , we will learn more when we read .

Leaning the facts is not really a bad thing to lean .
It depends on different people to learn .
Everyone also has it 's own way to learn .
We wo n't learn or follow the others step .
Everyone is different .
No one is the same .
Learning the facts is another way for learning .
Actually , learning the facts is almost at the end of the learning step .
If we spread it out , we would know that the first step of reading is to understand the ideas , and then it should be to learn the concepts .
After this two steps , it 's to learn the facts .

Although there has a lot of different ways to learn , I still would think the most important for the students to understand ideas and the concepts .
That 's because that 's the only way that my teachers teach me since I have been studying .
