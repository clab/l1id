In my opinion , I agree that it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This is not only because the generation we live is an infromation bombing generation , but also because if we can have broad knowldege of many academic subjects we can see this world in different ways .

According to some data , there are thousans of new information created every second , that is why we feel time is lost so quickly .
Though we ca n't read or experience every new creations , we still need to try , otherwise , we wo n't get up with the world .
Take my mother for example , she is a principle of junior high shcool , she is not very good at the new technic material .
Every time she wants to add a new cell phone number into her cell phone , she needs asking me to help her .
One day , she had to manage a new shool , and she would like to make a website to introduce her new school .
I think she worked very hard on this , and then she made it .
She made a very beautiful and praticle website on her own ; of course she asked many people for this .
After this event , I admire her more over .

On the other hand , my father is a teacher , too .
Two years ago , he retired , and finally he could go back to farm as he wich .
Compared with my mother , he rather grows some vegetable than to learn new techonic .
Until now , he ca n't do something with the computer by himself , although he always says he would like to do that , and of course it never happened .
I do n't mention that my father is useless , but if he could try and learn more about new subjects , I think his life will be easier and independable .

I know there maybe some people think that it is enough for us to specialize in one specific subject , but I suggest them to look forward to the real world .
We can find new things every day , and we should handle those new things , either .
If we would like to have a various kinds of life , it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects .
