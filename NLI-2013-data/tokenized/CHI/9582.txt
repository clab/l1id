When you open your magezines or open your televisions , you will always see some articles or some news which about some successful people in our society .
Some of them may running businesses well , some of them may doing well in there polictical career .
Maybe you will have a question that why these people can success .
For this question , some people may say that these people have the courage to do what other people do n't want to to , and I agree with this idea .
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
New things means new lives , and also , new risks means new awards .

First , in the new society new things means new lives .
Just like all of the inventors in the history , if you want to reach the new point of your lives , you must find out new things to support your career .
Like Edison found out the light , like the Shakespare created new kinds of article and dramas , and also like Marx who created socalism .
These people are considered successful people , because they found out or created new things .
For your lives , new things means new points , new status and new value of your careers .
So if you want to be a successful person like these famous people in the history , first of or , you should try news things , create new things for the society , not only do some common things in your lives .
But it 's not the thing if you want to be successful and you also should have the courage to take risks of your choices .

In our lives , risks not only means dangerous , but also means award , just like one person said before , how much you pay , how much you get .
Like these famous people in the history , they also took the risks or they could not become a successful people .
For our lives , risks also means awards , means opportunities , means the chance that you get the pay .
On the world , nothing is free , so if you want you be successful , you must take risks of your choices , take risks of your behaviours .

Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , at the opposite , if you want to be a successful person , doing new things and take risks are necessary .
New things means new lives and new beginning , and risks refers to the awards you will get .
