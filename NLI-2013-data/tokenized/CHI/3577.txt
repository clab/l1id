Do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
It is a great question to be offered because nowadays young generation ignore how to helping and contributing their communites more than the past .
I totally agree that instead of giving enough time to helping the society , they concentrate themselves more .

First of all , because of the education from the family and the society , they teach the young generation that they should think themselves first then the other things , even the things are about the country and the world .
The education tells them that no matter what happend , they should develope themselves first .
According to this kind of theory , nowadays the young generation becomes more selfish then the past one .
Due to this situation , I think that while we discuss that if the young people should pay more attention in their communities , the education of family and society should be discussed at the same time .

Secondly , nowadays no matter which country you belong , it is kind of tendency that there are fewer children in a family , for instance , mainland China , only one child in a family is normal .
Depending on this situation , the child does not know how to get along with the other people , how to care the peer and how to contribute himself for the society .
Surely , he will not focus on the need of the community and the world .
The first task he thinks is how to develope himself well .
Besides , nowadays parents always give too much pressure on young people 's grade , and I think that 's also the reason why the young generation ignore the communities and society .

To the summarize , it is kind of worse tendency that young generation does not pay attention to their communities .
In my opinion , if we hope to develope more wonderful society and world which we belongs , the first task we have to do is teaching the young generation does not be selfish any more , on the contrary , they should focus on the society and world more .
