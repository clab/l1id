As far as I am concerned , I am not agree with the statement at all that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are many reasons that I do not like the group led travel , and I will just explore the most important ones here .

The first reason I want to bring forward is that travel in a group led by a tour guide is so limited , not only the space but also the time .
Usually , the trace of this kind of travel has been planed before the travel begins .
So you just take a limited glance at some places you want to visit , which just decided by the tour guide .
There are always more places that will atractive your eyes beyond the tour guide 's thought .
Another aspcct is about the time .
It seems unwise not the follow the tour guide as near as possible , or you will fall behind .
Because the time of the travel depond on the tour guide instead of you .

Another reason , which is also commonly considered , is that the travel in agroup led by a tour guide is always in the holiday .
For some aspect , it is not bad .
However , travel in the holiday will cause many problems .
It is obviously that the tour places are rather crowed during the holidays .
If you want to take the group led travel , you just can avoid the unpleasant situation .
What is more , as a result of the rush of the holiday travel , many accidents are easily to take places .

In addition , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not a good idea for family travel .
In the modern society , people pay more attention to the time spent with family menbers .
If you choose to travel with your family indepedently , you will find it is much easier to enjoy the life along with the travel .

For the reasons above , it is surely that I will travel without the tour guide .
It is just realize the mean of the travel ---- for fun and pleasure .
