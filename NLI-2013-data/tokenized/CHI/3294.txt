I agree with this statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
Since the society we live in has changed with time , people nowadays spend more time establishing their own affairs and therefore they are easily tended to ignore the needs of other people , and young people are no exception .
In fact , young people spend most of their time concerning about their studies , their future careers , and they might be too busy to give time to help their communities .

Take Taiwan , my homecountry , as an example .
It is surely a very small island in the world , but meanwhile , there are still many people on this island .
The population density is astonishing .
Therefore , people here need to work or study hard in order to compete with others , and that might take them much time .
Young people in Taiwan need to worry about the school exams they are taking everyday and the future careers they are going to pursue .
They spend so much time at home studying or going to the cram schools that they only have little time for themselves , not to mention for their communities .

What 's more , people nowadays live more in apartments than in houses .
That is why they have fewer chances to communicate and interact with other people .
People living in apartments or mansions may not see the necessity of giving time to helping their communities or they may even think that there is no need for them to do so .
Indeed , it is nice to help the community , but not giving time to the community does not have any difference .

According to the reasons and examples I menioned above , I do agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .
And that will remain as a current trend in the present time and also in the future .
