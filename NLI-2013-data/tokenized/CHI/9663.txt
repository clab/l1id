New Thing Gives Success

Many people believe that if a person wants to be successful , he/she should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with it .
Although there are many different definations on the term `` successful people '' , I believe that if a person does not try new things , he/she would never be successful .
There are many successful people as examples for this statement , such as Albert Enstein and Bill Gates .

Albert Enstein is one of the most famous and revolutionary physists in history .
What has he done , is used his radicular thought on situation with speed of light to contrast with Sir Isac Newton 's theory , which is called classical physics and contains most basic theoris on forces at that time .
With this contrast , Albert Enstein established new physical theories .
By taking a try on new thoughts , Enstein had physical subjects step forward to new generations , and himself became a successful person .
He has said : `` Imegination is more important than knowledge . ''
As he said , without this creative thought , physics would never have a progress .

Another successful person I want to show here is one of the richest person in current world , whose name is Bill Gates .
He is the CEO of the biggest software campany , Microsoft .
With his great sense on the development of computer , he really passes a gate toward bill .
When he was still in his teen age , computer was really a rare thing .
Ignors the objection by his classmate , Bill quit Harvert University and takes this new thing , and also risks .
Of course , if he has continuoued his way in Havert , he may become a nice lawyer .
However , to him , nice means nothing .
He does not want to be normal .
By running personal computer programming business , which is a new task with new risk at that time , he successed .
Trying new thing gives him rewards much more then any one can image .

Not only Albert Enstein and Bill Gates are the successful people who have taken new things and risks , the ways of other successful people like Plank or Schrodinger to success are also trying new things .
Different people have different ways to success , but successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
