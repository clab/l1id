To understand the ideas and concepts and be able to utilize them is more important for students .
Once the ideas and concepts are clear to the students , they can easily relate those ideas or concepts to their own life experiences .
I agree with the statement because this is how I learn in the high school .

A good example can be seemed while my Physics teacher is teaching us the concepts of volecity and factors .
In order to make us understand that volecity is composed of different factors in different directions , the teacher gives an example of swimming in a river .
As most of the students has experienced or known that when there is a current in the river and the swimmer is swimming right across the river , he will not actually go straight across the river because the current is carrying him downstrean as he swims forward .
This really makes a lot of sense to all of us before we start learning any formulas .
However , if the teacher just want students to learn the fact that the swimmer will go across the river adjusent to where he sets off by illustrating with a right triangle , I will probably be the first one to be confused .

With the same source in my Math class , this idea comes to me when my teacher tells us a story of his own .
My math teacher used to be a straight-A student in the high school , and he did not care much about understanding the concepts of the course materials .
Instead , he solved the problems with formulas like a machine that does not know what exactly
