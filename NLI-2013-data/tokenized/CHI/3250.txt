I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are two reasons .
First , young people nowadays tend to be raised to be more self-centered in capitalistic places .
They are being told , either directly or indirectly , that fulfilling personal desires or achieving personal gains is more important than helping communities .
In capitalistic places , people emphasize more about their personal abilities and achievements rather than their sense of devotion and caring to a larger group other than their companies .
Although our school systems and communities try to send out the opposite messages , individual competition and the collapse of the sense of cooperation are on the winning side .
Second , young people today are raised to be more spoiled .
They get what they want eaiser .
They are more indulged in their personal comforts and pleasures .
Many of them may consider helping communities a waste of time .
They may think , `` What would helping communities do me any good ?
That wo n't necessarily make my report cards or resumes look good .
Who cares about community service certicates ?
Besides , I will get more fun to hang around in a mall and eat ice cream with my friends ! ''
In my opinion , the most inner reason that they see no points of helping their communities is because they are not used to helping and giving , but more to receiving .
Nowadays , parents who raise children tend to ask less but give more and more easily .
When people start to raise fewer children , they make their only or few children the queens and kings of the families .
Modern parents ' indulgence creates more selfish and indifferent children , which is harmful to our communities and society .
