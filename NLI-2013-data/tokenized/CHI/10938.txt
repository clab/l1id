On my own opinion , I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what thay already know how to do well .
First , I think they can success is because they have already take their risk , it is all risk out side the world , each thing has a risk but seems to big or small .
For example , if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be a accident on you .
Taking risk is a must .

The mean of success is they know how to do things well , human being has a think to learn more to find out new things .
Of course , by the way people is learning they will have many problems to solve .
Successful people knows that if they do n't find a new way or new thing to do , other people can catch up them .
They want to lead , so they have to seek , to seek what that the world needs so they can do it .
Although many people think successful people are selfish , just do things they like or they want , wo n't share with others , but I think it is only other people do n't understand what they are thinking .
THey have a different thought than others so they success , they wo n't just stop where they success .
They want more success , everyone wants more success but not everyone can do it , so they know they can do it they wo n't care about the risk , even the risk is big but if they can pass it they success .
They fail , they keep on going to find another thing .

For conclusion , I agree that successful people tyr new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
