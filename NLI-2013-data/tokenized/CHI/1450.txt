At the first , i have to emphasize that i totally agree with the statement .
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
Once you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will easily understand everthing in daily life and wo n't get confused by the subtle stuff .
The reason why people usually respect and trace abnormal stuff , even think it is enigma , is always coming from the lacking of broad knowledge .
If they had ever read a lot , then they would easily figure out why the miracle happens .
Like the magic show , the magician shows everthing superising and makes people confusing .
But if you ever had that kind of knowledge , and you will easily know what 's the secret inside .
Same example of chemist , they can make lots of uncommon species .
Without the broad knowledge , you will never know what truely happens inside .

Specializing in one specific subject is good for a researcher , that would lead him or she to discover science and advancing detaily .
But without a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , he might sometimes get confusing when his topic is out of his specific subject .
With a broad knowledge is the best way to fix the problem .
Same as the condiction today , scholars who study in biology start to study chemistry , and they also learn the physical process from the physicists .
The combination of then makes advancing for science researching .
