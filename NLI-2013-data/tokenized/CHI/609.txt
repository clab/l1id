According to this topic , it is really a question whether using the broad mind in subject is the better way than specialize .
Due to their respective angles , different people hold different view .
In my poinion , although the specialist in nowadays is important , the generalist is really the major part which cannot be reduced .
In the following discussion , I would like to provide the evidence to support my view on this topic .

As the developing of the technology all over the world , Things are changing with each passing day , the inventions always appears in the market , and we could fairly said that the specialist in the program is doing the great construction .
They have deep mind in their own major , and would provide the worthless suggestions to the people , if without their suggestion , it might be hard for people to invent the novel things .
Although they do not have the wide knowledge of all the area , acturally the depth of the major they are specialized may not be touched by the generalist .
And because of the depth , they could find out the useful imformations generalist could not find .
To be honoest , if without them , just using the broad knowledge way , not all the inventions could come out so quickly .
Hence the specialist is really play an important role over the world .

the specialist contributed to the society , does not mean the generalist is less useful .
In the actual life , they just using their wide information to connect the major which they researched with the other areas , which is important to the research .
If a major just have their way and not communicate with the others , they would just like the frog in the hole , which could not get the farther developed .
And the generalist using their broad knowledge of many academic subjects to straighten the connect with the reference major , which would provide the researcher more spaces to think and to compensate the weakless , using this way , the technology is growing so fast and just this way can giving the sociey long development .

From the above we can easily see that the specialist and generalist are all suficient to the society , either of which could not be missed .
Just using the whole imformation that they both summerized , the inventions would stable in the society , and meet the need of customers .
If just having the specilist , the things is just adopted in the small area , which means it can not get the greatly developed .
And also , just using the generalist 's mind , the things are not deep stand in the society , which means the other products would easily over them in the short time .
So the specialist and the generalist can not seperated .
From the specilist , the generalist could get the details of the inventions , and from the generalist , the specialist would not just focus their eyesight in the tiny area , hence as the compensation they two get togher would take the novel developed to the technology .
