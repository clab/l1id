In now day , many students learn things by memorize but not getting the main ideas .
Learing facts are important , but is n't it understanding the ideas and concepts of what you are doing much more improtant ?
Students has to know and have a idea what they are doing instead of just following the instrutions in a robort way .

First of all , students are not able to do the test if they do not understand the concept of the subject or unit .
For example , when you are doing a physics test , how can you do the calculations without knowing how the question is asking for ?
Sure , you can memorize the formulas and plug the numbers in for sure , but what if the teacher changed the question a little bit of what he is asking for ?
So , understanding is really important .

Next , facts is truth , of course it is important in daily life , but what does facts do with the educations of students at school ?
student 's job at school is to learn something that he or she is not able to learn at home .
Whatever the teachers have taught , if you do not understand what he or she meant , if you do not get the concepts , how are you able to learn things ?
For example , Macbeth by Shakespears , if you have actually read the play that Shakespears wrote , are you able to do the test by only reading it ?
You surely have to understand the main idea of what he was writting and what he wanted the reader to understand .
This is the ideas of the play .

As a result , there are so many things in the world that the students may not know yet .
But since the students understand the concepts or ideas for being a students , they are going to learn many things throughout their school life .
