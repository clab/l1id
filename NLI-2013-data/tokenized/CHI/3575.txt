First of all , I do not disagree with the statement of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , and secondly , I think this statement is merely based on the stereotypes which the adults project on adolescents .

Nowadays , young people are acting more independent than their seniors .
They know more of what they want , why they want it and how they going to get it .
However , this change does not please most of the adults who still believe in the social hierarchy of age which is keeping juniors under control .
This is the crux of the problem , and in this case , the two paries see the title and definition of `` helping thier communities '' differently .

In my neighborhood , there is a brilliant young girl who has saved many children from domestic abuses .
Whenever Sara hears parents beating their kids in a much too violent way , she is brave enough to report to the authorities concerned about each severe case in the community .
Nevertheless , most of the adults complaint about her behavior to her parents , and Sara get grounded several times for rescueing bleeding children and even bruised infants .

Moreover , in my colleage years , I have seen students organizing clubs which aim at supervising the school 's recycling operaiont or urging more tree planting on campus .
Most of their schemes , even in their most well-designed and pratical form , are rejected .
The school 's reluctance to participate in such community reform activities shows a rather great contrast to the students ' effort and desire of changing the world into a paradise .

As far as I know , only young people of Sara 's age admire her devotion to the neighborhood , and the adults simply see her as a trouble .
Also , the club members in my college never give up any chance to come to the community 's aid despite the negativeness of the school .
These situations teach me a lesson about how aduts or the whole society will not always be right .
Young people from around the world all possess great passions in helping their communities to become a better place to live , and sometimes , they are even more enthusiastic than the grown-ups surrounding them .
