Since the technology is getting more and more advanced , people 's lives improved a lot .
Now people wo n't only think about how to make lives , instead , they will think about how to make their lives better .
More and more entertain are requested , and people start to enjoy their lives by having entertainment .
About the question whether young people enjoy life more or older people do , in my opinion , it depends on different people 's perspectives and different stages they are at .
This essay will discuss this issue by showing different people 's point of view .

For those people who are still going to elementrary school , they do n't even know what their life will be like .
They have flexible schedule ; and most of their time is spent on playing .
If this is also called a way to enjoy life , then the little kids express their enjoyable by enjoy playing .

After a person is in the high school , he may has some ideas about what direction his life will be like .
Teenagers are the generation who really know how to play the technology .
There is a fact that the people who know how to use computers are most teenagers .
Even though they have to study at school most of the time , they still have a lot of after school activities .
Teenagers are the ones who know how to hold a party the most ; also they are the customers who go to movie theatres often .
Teenagers enjoy their lives by spending time on parties , watching movies .
They are the ones who know how to use entertainment .

When people start their careers , obviously they do n't have enough time to do entertainment , but they still enjoy lives .
After finish the whole day 's work , they choose to relax themselves by watching tv , or playing sports , or listening to music .
As long as they feel relax , not as stress as working , they will know how wonderful their lives are .

Now it 's time to see how old people enjoy their lives .
Maybe some people will think that they are too old to enjoy life , well , it 's not true .
Because the society is improving , people start to care old people more .
There are a lot of places only for old people , and there are a lot of sports instruments for them to practice .
Old people like to get together and talk about their life in the past , and sometimes they will make up music bands , which some people at other age enjoy the most .

Based on the discussion above , it is easy to figure out that people at all ages enjoy their lives .
The only difference is they enjoy lives by different ways .
There might be some cases that some people always feel depressed and they do n't like their life , but in most of the situation , I think people will prefer to be happy .
As long as people feel positive about their daily , they will enjoy .
