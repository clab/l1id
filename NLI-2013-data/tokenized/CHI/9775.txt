Some peole like to try new things and make successe ; while others enjoy doing the same tasks or matters they already know .
As far as I am concerned , I am the person who hate doing repeated things .
As a result , I agree successful people experience new matters and take risks .
Following are the reasons .

First of all , some people like me like to enjoy the fresh things .
These people will cultivate their interests during the new things , and they will love and immerse themselves to new things .
Take me for example , I major in the Industrial and Information Management department .
In this field , we all have to study the operation management subject .
However , I thought it was very boring after two years studying them .
I turned to related subject , which called logistics .
I had not studied before , but I developed my interest in this subject and now I love the subject very much .

In the second place , some people like to take risks and make fortunes .
Imaging that you have some money on hand .
Will you deposit your on-hand money or you will invest them to get the expected reward and take some risks .
The interest rate in bank now is very low ; therefore , if we choose save our money into the bank , we cannot get the same amount as the investment does .
Now , what do you think ?

However , there are still some successful people through doing what they already know .
I am of the opinion that these people have experienced many new things and own vast knowledge in their mind .
When they face some situations , the vast knowledge is the basis for decision process .
These successful people easily know how to transform the knowledge into the real cases .
That is to say , they are not doing the same things ; rather , they utilize the basic concepts in their mind to solve many diverse situatations and make a success in the long run .

Due to the mention above , I am of the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks .
