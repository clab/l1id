I disagree about , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because learn facts are more interesting , students can get more information when they are learing facts , and students can also understand the ideas form fascts .

When student are learning something , they usually very easy to get brod , that is more fun if teacher talk about facts .
such as a history class , if the teacher just talk about the years and what issues happened in the year , stduents do not formilier with it , and the teacher talk about some stories about thoes issues , students will pay atention to the fun stories .

Students need to learn many information everyday , and learn facts could get many information from it .
If a teacher show a fact about law , students may learn about many other knowlege , like math , different people .

Students learn fascts is not just for fun , is also can get the ideas when they are learning .
When a teacher are talking a story , students are still thinking about it , like which is de bad porsen , which is the good thing to do , and so on .

I think learn facts are more important .
