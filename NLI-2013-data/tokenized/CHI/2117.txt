I disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Being different age stage , older people have different spirit world with the young people .
Firstly , Old people have more abundant experience in their lives than that of young people .
Young people will have a lot of risks to attempt to do everything that they have not meet with , and they will suffer the failure that the world gives to them .
When they feel fail they will rely on the older people to help or to share the experience that the young people have not .
And the older people enjoy the quiet and idely life in the world .
They can do everything calmly and happly , they will happy to teach the young people the proper ways that live in the world .
They have so many nice memories that happened in their past life , even meeting with failure , they will become more wiser and sophysicated .

Secondly , Old people have little stress from the society .
In the advancing technology society , with the advent of new technology and discovery , young people feel the great stress in the society , they must advance their knowledgy and technology level to fit with the fast pace of the society .
They should work hard to make money and not be dropped out by the peers in the intense competition .
However , the older people have no stress , Also they will benefit from the advanced society .
because they have accomplished the task and have more time to share the achivement they made in their young times .
They can do fishing and travele by airport not just spend more time on train as past , they will communicate with their friends on Internet , not must to write a letter that will arrive at their friends after a few days .
They will have the happiness to teach their granddaughters .

Of course , the young people has so many enjoyment in this world .
Their curiousity make them to discover new things .
It is so wonderful to taste the different foods in differend country and feel the different culture in other countries far away from the country they live in .
They have the energy to climb the mountains that abundant their adventure experience in their lives .
They have so many chance to see the change of the world .

In summary , Older people will enjoy the wonderful world in their ways , and young people will also find so many interesting things continuesely in the world .
