Some people may think that young people tend to enjoy life harder than older people do because the young have been brough up in a society which teaches people to enjoy .
However , I do not agree with the statement ; the older are the ones who truly understand how to enjoy and what to enjoy .

Admittedly , young people are more likely to accept the newly developed technologies , such as the chatting on line program MSN , more quickly than the seniors do .
In such condition , they can enjoy life better .
However , it does not mean that the young enjoy life more .
In most cases , older people are also eager to learn new implements which can benefit their both academic career and leisure time .
Although to a cartain degree , older people are slow learners , but their motivation and their experience they have will help them to finally manage the technology and use it for enjoyment .
The only difference between the young and the older is the time when to manage the technology to enjoy life .

Some may argue that , being young , most people do not have the family supporting burden , thus having enough money and time , and being able to do whatever they like .
But when having the finacial burden on themselves , the older are incline to cherish time and money and will not chose a expensive and time assuming way for enjoyment .

Further more , being older , they have experienced much more than the young people and consequently know more about what are the most important things in one 's life , and will chose the meaningful way to kill their time instead of doing something senseless .
On the contrary , young people lack the experience to judge whether something is good or not , so they tend to have the wrong mode to enjoy life .

In conclusion , as older people have experienced more the young do , they have more motivation and knowledge than the young do , on how to enjoy their life meaningfully and wisely .
