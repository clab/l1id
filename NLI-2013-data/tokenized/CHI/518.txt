Nowadays , people 's daily life are full of different kinds of information .
And with the high-speed development of technology , the relation between different fields ' knowledge are much more closer .
So if you want gain a successful career , you 'd better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Car industry set an goog example for my opinion .
To make you company earn more profits , only imroving the technology is not enough .
It is true that people prefer the car that has better quality , good design , and lower cost .
And also technology can fulfill these target .
But after you producing such a good car , the really more significant thing is how to sell it or how to occupy more market , which need the theory and knowledge of enterprise management .
You should have a acute sense of what your potential consumer is need , what they think the car should be , and the most important factor that can determine how well your car 's selling is how much they can afford .
Without all of these useful knowledge , I mean what in different fields , the company will lose their customer , then lose their market and finally close down .

Service industry is another exaple that indicates what I have asserted .
Many people think that the only skill that a waiter or some other people who provide service is being good at making their customers or clients feel comfortable and satisfied .
However , it is not the case .
The fact is these people also need some necessary knowledge to cater to different taste of different people .
For instance , the receptionist who work in an international hotel .
Firstly , they need know how to serve customers .
They can learn from the books which contain different customer , different culture and suitable manners .
They also should master at least foreign language to make they can communicate people who speak different language .
If they can not , they may lose their job .

According what I refered above , I can confidently draw the conclusion that have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not only make one 's life more colorful , but also make one much more competitive in today 's labor market .
