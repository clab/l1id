I agree what the statement just said , successful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Waht is the correct meaning of successful is that you need to try your best , and you also need to learn new thing to improve youself .
If you want to prove yourself into success , the way you do it 's that to learn more thing and whaen someone is asking you , you need to able to answer them .
When you solve someone 's problem , i think that guys will think you are good because you know the things they do n't know .

The successful person 's personality must be very confident , problem solver and be intellgent .
This kind of person will like to learn more things , and they will try to find out the problem they ca n't even figur it out .
They have to be not very pround of it , because if someone is trying to ask you question and you starting to have the feeling like you are the powerful , wise people .
I promise abou that next second you will be in the deep cave , and nobody will think you are a successful person .

Actually , been a successful person is not easy as you are learning somthing .
Learning is very basic to be success , but the way and the attitude you face is very hard to understand properly .
Such as you are a very wise and you know lots of things , but you always think you are the only successful person in the world and you don ' like someone asking you question .
How do you know that everyone know you is a successful person , they will just think that you do n't know the question so you are not able to tell them .

`` To be or not to be is a question '' , this greeting is very famous and important to the person who is success .
Just to learn as much as you can learn , then you will be the successful people .
