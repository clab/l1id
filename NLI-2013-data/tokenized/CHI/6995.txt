Some people believe that , in about twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In my point of view , I do not agree with such assertion , and I have two major rearons for my view .

Firstly , I am aware of the fact that people love cars .
From the time the humans were able to build airplanes and automobiles , these dreams and the realization became the pride of the century .
The history of the automobils stands for a turning point for the modern world .
Poeple design cars , and they cherish what they have done to open the market and world for automobiles .
Successful examples such as the Volkswagen and the BMW have been the symbols of the glamour of this industry .
Therefore , in such a period of time of twenty years , cars will still hold the love for millions around the world .
The numbers of prodction will only be steady , if only not to increase .

Secondly , we need the automobile industry to provide job opportunities .
As a result , as we need this industry to grow at a steady pace , we need automobiles in our lives .
Imagine thousands of commuters boarding onto the public transportaiton in a single week .
It would not only be a huge burden for the the transportaiton system , but also affects many aspects of our lives .

Overall , in the next twenty years , I do not think that there will be fewer cars .
We need cars regardless what the world will become .
