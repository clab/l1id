In this statement of choosing if will be fewer cars use than there are today , i think my answer is there will be fewer cars in some places in the world and some other places staying the same of even increase the car using .
The following points are my reasons for my opinion .

The first reason is different countries require different uses of cars .
We know that in the world today , there are different levels of countries .
What i mean is there are developed countries and developing countries or even poor countries .
Different countries require differents uses of cars like China .
China is such a big country and it definitely require lots of cars as it got the biggest population in the world .
Some small countries like Tailand or Canada , they got maybe just one ten of the populations as China , therefore they might have less uses of cars all the time long .

The second reason i think is because cars make too much polutions .
There are millions or even billions of cars in the world .
Everyday we see cars driving on anywhere as a city living people .
In some big cases like HongKong , Beijing , NewYork , these are major cities in the world and certainly as too much cars inside there will be more poluted gas coming out .
People can easily get sick by those gas as it originally come by oil .
Also the plants out in the nature and all kinds of enviroment .
As people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment , i think that some countries will reduce the uses of cars in the following years .
Besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car uses , these countries might keep their numbers of uses of cars .

The last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology .
Today we can almost see computers anywhere in the world , we can see many differents kinds of inventions coming out .
These new things are invented for helping human beings to live better .
I surely to say that it will do same on the cars .
In many developed countries like America and England , German .
There are always new productions coming out , there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water !
The resource is something we can get easily .
Anyway , my opinion is that as some powerful countries can do very good on inventing , they must reduce the old type of cars before .

In a word , cars are still important in some of the places in the world and some of the places are getting rid of them .
It depends on how you want to use cars and the most important thing related to it , which is the environment .
