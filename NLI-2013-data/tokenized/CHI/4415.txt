I do agree with the viewpoint that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are .
In fact , the purpose of the advirtisement is to incite the desire of the customers and increase the sales of their products .
It is unavoidable to use some kind of communation skills to stimulate customers to buy their products .

In order to increase the sales of the products , advertisements will mask some kind of shortages of their products and only put emphasis on the outstanding points of the products .
For example , the renovation of the processors of the personal computers is fast .
Many processors manufactures always emphasize on the processing speed of their products .
However , they never mention some important features such as how much electricity will be used for using the chips and how hot they will produce during usage .
For a good computer , low temperature and stable performence are far more important rather than fast speed , however , the advertisements never expose their shortages .

Another example is the advertisements for restaurants .
They always show how good their foods are and how low cost for their foods .
However , the advertisements seldom give correct information to costemors that what kind of food is good for health and necessary for human body .
The purpose of the photos of the advertisement is to arise the interests of customers and the ultimate goal is to sell their products .
In addition , when we buy foods in malls or supermarkets , we can often discover that the pictures do not match with the products .
The photos of their products are surely more beautiful than they are in reality .

Good advertisements will deliver the correct information to the customers and help customers make reasonable decision .
On the other hand , inadquate advertisements will affect the brand images of the products and further damage customers .
In my opinion , more and more poor advertisements are showing throuth different media and thus it will be more difficult for customers to make right decision in the future .
