Older people enjoy life more than younger people because of time , money , and freedom .
Although they do n't much more spirit than the young people , they value enjoying life more than young people .

Older people cannot live in the world with a long period of time , so they try to enjoy life with their sons , daughters , wives , or husbands .
They try to spend much more time on their families , besides spending time on working .
It is because many of them are retired or work less than young people .
Young people always spend their time on their works , without enjoying life with their families .
So , older people have more spare time to enjoy life with their families .

Moreover , older people realized that they have so many things , which they want to do most .
And they cannot do them when they were young .
For example , they want to travel around the world .
They have much money and so much time to travel around , which compares to young people .
If you do n't have enough or much money , how can you enjoy better life .
Many people do n't have much money because they need to buy a house for their life in the future , their saving accounts do n't have enough money for them to enjoy life .

Older people have less things to care about .
For example , older people , who is over fifty years old , do not need to care so much about their sons ' or daughters ' education , or their daily lives because they are mature enough to take care of themselves or supports their own live .
Older people have much more freedom , so they can enjoy life without any worries .
They have more opportunities for them to do other things with lots of freedom .

In the conclusion , young people have many limitations which cause them enjoy life less than older people .
