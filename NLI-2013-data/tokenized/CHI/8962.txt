Just like football players understand the strategies of the coach , but they do n't understand how to apply these plans they will still lose the game ; just like one may know the techniques of painting but he or she does n't know how these techiques would create a real pictures or he never saw a picture using these kinds of techniques , he still can not draw a beautiful pictures ...
As far as I concerned with the topic stated above , I wo n't agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and comcepts than it is for them to learn facts .

The reasons go as follows :
To begin with , as we all know the ideas and concepts are usually more abstract than the facts .
It is more difficult for the students to understand at the beginning .
If the students can know the facts first and then relate the facts to the theories , it is easier for them to understand deeply .
It is always the case in the study fields such as economics , maths , physics .
Perhaps everyone may have the experience that the professors will explain the theory of movement in the physics lesson by telling the facts at the very beginning .

Secondly , when we think deeply , we will ask ourselves : what are the ideas and concepts serving for ?
Of cause it is served to apply to the daily life , or more accurate , we use it to explain the facts .
So how can we know the concepts without knowing the facts ?
For instance , students know the idea of the transportation of the electonic but they do n't know about the facts that this theory is applied to make the telephone , what 's the purpose of knowing the theory concept .
The ideas and concepts become more valuable only when they apply to our daily life and improve our life quality .

Last but not the least , the ideas and concepts today may not be correct just like the theory of nature seletion and evolution were not true long time ago .
So the students need to know the facts and compare the facts with the idea in order to verify and make sure if it go with each other .
It is also very important for a student to challenge the existing ideas using the facts they know .

In a word , I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts at the same time .
