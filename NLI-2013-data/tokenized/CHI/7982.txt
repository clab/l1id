It 's the travel time , do you prefer travel alone or with a group led by a tour guide ?
A good question , I would not hesitate to go with a group led by a tour guide .

There are too many advantages to travel with the group led by a tours guide .
First , the efficiency issue .
We are busying on studying , working or anyother things , or you even can not imagine how we can spare ten or more minutes to google all the travel information and accomadation .
Preparation of travel is a time-consuming process , and it may get you stressed out when there 's no hotel room or air ticket available on a particular day .
If it 's with a group led by a tour guide , no worries , they arrange every single detail for you in advance .
So they reduce your effort and save your energy .

Second , the safety issue .
If we travel alone , we may choose driving for sightseeing among nearby place .
As we know , people are fatigue when they travel around , in the meantime , their focus on driving is distracted by views or landscapes outside of the car window .
Car accident probability during travel time ranks the top among other accidents situation according to our national survey .
I was involved in the exactly same situation once when I drived with my boyfriend , that 's a nightmare , you may never want to experience .

Third , the travel perception issue .
It 's no doubt that tour guides are real experts for explaination of tour sites .
As we may experienced , you are more exposed to the thorough information about specific place than you travel alone .
In addition , the tour guides are more informed about regulations or price change for relative sighseeing issue , therefore we can avoid some useless rush .
That 's why the tourist industry keep booming these years in our city for these 4 consecutive years .

Nevertheless , we embrace all intrinsic advantages of traveling with group led by tour guide , we may still have some pity for its inconvenience and comfortable concern .
We are not allowed to go wherever we feel like to go since it 's hard for tour guide to organize a huge group , we follow tour guide 's preference other than our owns .
Also , sitting in a tour bus with 40 people interrupted by any of their snoring or other noise seems not as enjoyable as driving my own car with my friends .

Even so , I still would jump up to choose travel with a group led by a tour guide if I were given a chance to select comparing with travel alone , and it 's obvious advantages outweigh its shortcomings , Travel with the group led by a tour guide can also foster our networking opportunity during the trip and may learn across culture .
What a good chance to know people beyond the above attractive conditions !
