With the fast pace of development of human civilization , more and more people pay attention to the advertisements of prodects .
Presently , numerous people are willing to buy products based on the information delivered from the advertisements because the products seem appealing in these advertisements .
However , from my own experiences , I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Recently , the products appear in advertisements become more and more attractive due to their well decorated appearence .
People have the desire to buy things that look beautiful but at the same time , they will loss the awareness about how good the products will be .
For example , I had bought a pair of sneakers because they are colourful and be placed in a delicated box .
Actually , they looked really good .
However , the endurance of the sneakers was out of my imagination .
I just had worn them twice and both soles were broken .
Unforturnally , I was cheated by the advertisement .
Sometimes , advertisement of the appearence of a product is not reliable .

Moreover , people will ignore some significant information if they completely believe advertisement .
It is obvious that the manufacture will not show the disadvantages of their products in the advertisements and people have to observe the real quality of a product by their own .
This is also the reason that many social organizations doing a variety of experiments on a single product in order to discover the secrets behind advertisement .
Actually , people need socialy authority to help them to choose products due to the immense unclear advertisements spread out in our society .
Conspicuously , the existence of this kind of organization helps customers to clearfy the some of the fake condition created by advertisements .

To sum up , people should become aware about the advertisements they see and hear everyday because most of them contain fake and unclear information .
If we accidentally trust a unreliably advertisement , the outcome is unconceiveable .
