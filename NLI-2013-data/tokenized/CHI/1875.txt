Well , i agree the statement .
In nowdays , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Because young guys or girls like their life .
Surely , I am not saying the aged are do n't like their life .
I just mean , young people can use their time in pleased .

As you know , young people like travelling singing dancing and so on .
In the part time , a bunch of young poeple have a trip .
Drive their cas , go to mountins , in the mountins , they sing a song in a big volume , it dose not mattter , it 's funny , no one will say : `` hey , guy be quite ! ''
