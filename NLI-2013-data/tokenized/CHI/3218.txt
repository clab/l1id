In my limited experience , it is quite true that more and more youngsers neglect their own communities and pay scarce time and attention on hepling their communities .
Personal speaking , I think that there are three possible causes of this results .
First , more youngsters are taught to study harder and focus on their schoolwork , and this may make them more self-centered because teachers and even their parents require them to pursue their own accomplishment or higher grades in every contests .
Thus the younsters surrouded only by this information gradually accept this thought and are less willing to attend the publich issues , like helping their communities .
Second , it might be possible that the youngsters spend their time with their own friends playing the basketball or baseball , studying and preparing for the exams , or something eles .
Whateve they do , they always take activities together , and stay in their own groups ; therefore , if the original goal of their groups is not to help their communities , they will never touch such issues .
We all know the power of the group to constrain the members to obey and do those things recognized by other members , so this would be one of the reasons that cause them unwilling to help their communities .
Last but not the least , such events may be caused by the lack of their passion to help others .
Our education system always uses the acheivement in the school performance or the grades in the exams to assess the potential of the students as a reference of selection in university entrance exam , and therefore both the students and their parents place this event a top priority , so no wonder there are less and less youngsters who devote themselves to the public issues and are happy to help others , including their communities .
In summary , I think it is the ignorance of public issues that causes them pay much attention on helping their communities .
