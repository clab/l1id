Why , you may wonder , should we purchase items according to advertisements ?
When facing this decision whether or not to believe an advertisement , somebody will claims that they trust these things , but others , in constrast , will believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than their practical situations .
From my point of view , I 'd like to choose the second one and my arguments are listed as follows .

First of all , an important reason why I hold confidence on this view is that the advertisements always states how well their products are .
They may claim that they company has a strong background and what they produce may have some perfect effects .
However can you believe that there is something perfert in the world ?
Usually , their words are not true .
For example , there is a famous company , Odian Company in China , which is focusing on the production of modern floors .
In its advertisement , It claims that its commander center is located in Germany , but this have been disapproved by a newpaper .
Therefore , how can we believe the advertisement like that ?

Furthermore , another reason for my inclination for my view is that we can not find the beautiful characteritics stated in advertisements .
That is to say ; when we buy one item and begin to use it , we may find that these `` splendid '' characteristics disappers and some new problems arise .
From a practical point of view , the advertisements will always blow up in order to make money .
For instance , one of my classmates has ever brought an air condition .
According the statement of the advertisement , it will not produce much noice .
However , his practical experience proved that it is not easy to fall sleeping if this machine is turned on .

Of course , an advertisement can tell us something useful .
For a new product , a good advertisement can help the customers to learn some detailed things about it and spread its impacts in the society .
Specially , to some extent , I 'll agree that the statements in a couple of advertisement may be consistent with the real features .
However , if all the aspects are contemplated , it seems advisable for us to believe that most advertisements will blow up .

In a word , although advertisements can supply some useful information , most of them are blowing up in order to make profits .
What they claim just try to tell something unture to make their products more attactive .
From all the above arguments , we can reach the conclusion , that most advertisement will blow up in their introduction .
