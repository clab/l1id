I agree that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well '' .
As we are in the 21 century , the world is fast changing , so we need to keep learning new things so that we can keep up with the world 's step .
If someone wants to be susseccful , only follow the others is definitly not enough .
A successful man , a talent , must know have to lead behind the people , he must always be one step faster than the ordinary people , thus taking risks is quite necessary .
Only follow the traditions and rules and do the things `` what they already how to do well '' will never make people successful and even may destroy them , makes them the ones how can not follow the changing world .
People should not hesitate to take risks .
Talents take risks , they never afriad of losing because it will only make them stronger .
No one can deny that Thomas Edison is a successful man .
He is probably the most famous inventor of the world ; he is the father of modern light .
What does a inventor do everyday ?
He takes risk .
If Thomas Edison has not invented modern light , the world will be complete different today .
Another example of successful people try new things and take risk is founder of Microsoft Corporation , Bill Gates .
He has studied in a famous university but he has stopped doing `` what he already know how to do well '' .
He has quited from the university and has started his own business .
Now , he is the richest man is the world .
He owns billions of dollars and everyone who has a personal computer use his `` Windows '' software program .
He is successful and he takes risks .
`` Only doing what they already know how to do well '' only makes people nobodies .
Every year , millions of skilled and experienced old worker in developing countries like China , retire from factories .
They have kept doing their works , `` what they already know how to do well '' every workday .
When they finally retired , they have found that they are nobodies and are not successful at all .
It is their fault that they have not taken risks .
If they have started business or got other creative ideas , they may have much better lives now .
In conclusion , successful people are more likely to take risks .
