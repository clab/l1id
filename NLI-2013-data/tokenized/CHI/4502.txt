I agree with this statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
This why we can see so many companies invast their money in the commerical every year .

First , it is fame .
Maybe one company 's product is good , but if there is just few people know it .
The product will fail , because it is not famous .
Of course , the product will not sell well .
Instead , if today this product is pretty famous , it is easier to sell .
For example , I am also play the customer role in my life .
I used to buy one famous brand of milk .
And I quietly to buy other unfamous brand of milk .
If the survey asked me `` why you always buy this brand of milk ? ''
I will answer , because of it is fame , I believe the famous brand is better than others . ''
However , do I really do the reserch about the milk ?
And prove it real better than other brands .
Of course not .

Second , even the most advertisements enlarge the real funtion of product .
But most people still believe that , and they will try to buy it .
Because they want make their life better .
For instance , the energy drink , there are many people drink this kind of beverage .
They believe this drink brings them energy and power .
Somehow , some people even think they cannot live without it .
Is it really have so wonderful effect on the body ?
I do n't agree with it .
I think the purchasing is result from the advertisement .
It makes people believed what they saw .

To sum up , I strongly agree with this satement .
Because I am also the customer in my life .
Through the advertisements , they meke me to trust their funtion better than they really are in the life .
