I totally agree with the statement of `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Why I agree with this point of view , and how do I feel about it ?
I think there would be some good reasons for getting young people nowadays can be more invoed with their communities .

First of all , I think why the young people nowadays do n't like spending time with their communities , because in the morden day as we are now , there are lots of interesting things and places that young people prefered to take .
Such as video games , internet , travelling , and meeting new friends these are the reasons that take lots of time from the young people nowadays than the young people at the past-time .
Another main point I think will be the industry revolution .
In the past time they need a lot of body work that mean everyone have to get involed their communities to help each other .
But at nowadays , we are living in an very different forms of life than the early days .
That everyone just have to take care of their own life and no need to rely on the others .

How is it effect to our nowadays communities by the young people do not give enough time to helping ?
I think it affects in many ways of our socity .
One the main effects , I think , is the relationship between people live in communities .
As the result of this problem the relationship get colder and colder between each others .

So I think if we can encourage the young people to helping their communities in many different ways that will bring people close of their communities .
People will start knowing each other and helping each other , and it can also help the young people to do more valueable things than just waste their time on the other things .
