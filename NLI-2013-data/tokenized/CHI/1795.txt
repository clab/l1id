I stronly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In my point of view that , on the contrast , older people could face their life in a posituve way and do some valuable things that they want to and they have not a demanding attidute toward others .
Older people , Therefore , I think would enjoy life more than young people .

At the first place , older people have enough time to travel and see the world .
I , myself , am a local English tour guide in Beijing , my hometown , as a part-time job .
Most of the tourists I took were the eld people from Australia .
The most situation for them were they had travelled many places in the world after they got retired and they told me the stories about their travelling .
When they were telling those stories , what I saw from theri face was the happiness they got from travelling .

Seconly , they , the older people , could face their life in a positive way by which they enjoy themself very much .
Most of old couples I took were this sort of people .
It is commen things for them to pick trash up on the ground while the young people around were just past by or kicked it off .
I remember that an old man who got a band back persist to climb up to the top of the Great Wall without any help , such cable car .
I was told by him that this was part of my life and I enjoyed it very much .

On the other hand , most of the young people in my life including my cannot enjoy our life by traveling .
First , we do n't have that much of money to support the travelling ; second , the most important thing for us is study .
Besides , young people have n't not that much life experience which might lead they see things in a negative way .
Take a freshmen in my college this year for example .
This student , who majoys in Spanish , jumped themself from the forth foor just for a n unbeliveable reason that she could not pronause the Spanish sound extactly .

To sum up it , I do not agree that statemant of young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I do think that it is old peopel who have much life experience to enjoy .
