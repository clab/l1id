I am agree with this statement .
It 's true that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .

As advertisements are used to attract customers and to make the products more popular , the companies would n't lose this chanllege to show the best side of their products .
Sometimes , they also give an image which is not true of their products to customers .
This is an image which customers desire but not an image which below to the products .
We kow that most companies face to a great competition , there are son many comapnies produce the same product .
So companies have to do much efforts in order to be more stronger .
Meanwhile , if there is one comopany have atoped some advertisements to make its products more attractif , it 's not fair that others companies of the same sector do nothing .

But should customers be victim of companies ' competition and profits ?
No , we are the customers , and we have the rights to know the truth .
We want to buy the products which we want .
We pay for what we desire , and we wo n't pay for lier .
In some paticular sectors , like medicin , some people died because advertisement did n't give the truth .

But there is n't a rule agains this action .
So between moral and rule , we should have a correct choice .
