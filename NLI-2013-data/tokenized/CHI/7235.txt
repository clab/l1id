A number of people maintain that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
While the first reaction of some people may be to disagree with this statement , there are conpelling the reasons to explore this issue more in depth .
Form my point of view , I find i agree with this statement for two reasons .

One reason that I can support is that I can control the time by myself .
For example , last year , I came to Japan with my friend because we are too crazy on shopping clothers .
Then we was lost with our tour guide .

However , the last reason why i can agree with this statement is I can do everything I like to do .
For instance , My parents want to visit my aunt when they came to LA with a tour guide , but they can not go .
They need to follow the tour guide 's schudel .
All of these reasons had influeced me more in depth .

Of I know there may be some people disagree with me , but
