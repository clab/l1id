Currently , the controvesial issure of to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject urges great attention among the public and individuals .
As far as I concerned , it is much intricate to draw a sweep generalized conclusion .
With the diversity of the society , the demands for the diverse human resouce is required as well , meanwhile it depends on the stage and the position the person holds .

From a undergraduated student 's perspective , it is obviously better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjuct .
Since not only will a broader academic knowledge area bring to wider the students ' thoughts , but will help them to study their major better .
Variety of academic knowledge ask people to have strong logic to view the issue , so it will help the students to view their major from different perspective .
Moreover , it will provide students with a chance to find out the specific subject they desire to futher .

However , for a graduated student , it is vital to be specialized .
A graduated student , who is going to face the challenge of development and research in his / her major area , should have specilized knowledge structure to be responsible for the improvement of the society .
At this extent , general conprehensiviation of knowledge is rather than adiquent .

On the other hand , for a maneger or someone who may be high than this level , should not only be specialized in their subject but also have to have broad knowledg of many subjects .
The people at this level should be more prudent in every decision they make , so they have to consider every aspect carefully before they make the decisions .
As so , quiet a lot aspects require quiet a broader knowledge areas .

Different people have knowledge for different intention ; different intentions give them different motivations ; different motivations bring them different interests and profits .
It is impossible to cover all actors as a whole in this issure , however , as for me , a undergraduated student , to learn as many subject as I can to find the most appealing area and to understand my major knowledge futher will be my option ..
