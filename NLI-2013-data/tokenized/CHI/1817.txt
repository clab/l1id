Nowaydays , there is a great generation gap between the youth and older people .
Sometimes they are quite distinguished from others .
It was generally agreed that Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
But in my opinion , I do n't agree to the opinion .

In the first place , many young people enjoy their life so much .
They are very modern and familiar with all the new-coming products .
For instance , internet , electronic products , and newly conventions are made great use of by them .
They realize what the real world is and have their ideal life style .
Their idea is to make the world colorful , funny and full of significance .
Only by doing things for the society can they feel real happiness .

Oppositly , there still remains a large number of young people who are doing nothing everyday .
If they were asked what they are doing , they would answer they were enjoying .
They drink , do sports , play computer games , change boy/girlfriends frequently , rob money or small items from children and do whatever they can .
Is it a real `` enjoy '' ?
Absolutely no !
Ignoring the bad things they made , they lead to bad impact to the society .

From the views of some people , older people are considered to be outdated .
But to my surprise , in some cases they can enjoy their life much more than young people .
In spite of their weak body , they will be laughing everytime .
Seeing the sun rising from the east , they will get up , doing exersice and listening to the radio .
They will fill up their life with happiness .
After they concern about the current affairs , they will note down their thoughts and send to the goverment .
In cities , they will be a volunteer .
The traffic manager , cleaner or a `` moving map '' are shown ever All in all , both young people enjoy life .
