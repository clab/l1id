I do n't agree with the statement .
I think in twenty year there will be more cars than today .
My opinion is based on the following reasons .

First , the cars are the most individual transportation tools .
They give people the freedom to choose when to leave and where to go and can make the journey more convinient .
As the society develops , pressure will increase and we are more and more likely to search for the freedom in our lives .
Cars are a good choice .
Although more cars will result in traffic jams in cities , people are building the cross bridges to solve the problem .

Second , many people may argue that the waste gas from the cars are one of the major reasons that pollute air .
However , scientists now have developed many kinds of cars that use clean energy such as the energy from the sun and so on .
These kinds of cars are in use in some countries by some people .
Moreover , scientists and manufacturers are trying their best to put these new cars into markets , aiming that these cars will be affordable for the public .
At the same time , scientists are also doing great effort to improve the speed of the these new cars .
And I believe in a near future , these new cars using clean energy source , will be as fast as the cars nowadays .
Also , I think the clean energy will also be used in the cars today , which will greatly decrease the pollution made now .
As a result , the major obstacle that prevent car using will be removed .

Third , as the economy of the world develops , the price of cars will go down , as well as the new cars .
Meanwhile the ability of people to buy cars will increase .
More people in the developed countries will own cars .
Each family or person will own more cars .
Further , more people in the developing or less developed countries will buy cars .
For example , in China only a few people have cars , and as the ability of consumption advances , more and more people are planning to buy cars .
And I think in the near future , there will more cars than now will be seen in the roads of China .

In conclusion , I think the number of the cars will increase , because cars can give every one a feeling of freedom , and as many problems caused by cars can be solved and the more and more people are able to afford a car , we are willing to buy this kind of freedom of our lives .
