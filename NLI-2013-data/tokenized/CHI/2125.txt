A famous saying goes , `` Everything has two sides '' .
Depending on personal experience , personality type and emtional concern , I realize that some people hold an idea that young people 's lives are more joyful than older perople 's , meanwhile others prefer the other side of this point .
In my opinion , young people truely does have more joyful life than older people .
In the following discussion , I would like to provide three conspicuous aspects to support my view point .

In the first place , young people has more `` toys '' to play with .
Computers , Play Statioins , XBoxes , are all favorite things for teengers even children .
However , older people even do not know what are these `` wired mechines '' use for .
For example , one time , I was playing games on my computer , my little sister came to me and asked me to let her play for awhile .
She did a good job on playing with it .
In contrast , when my grandpa came to me , he thought I was watching movies on my computer .
Because of the learning speed of older people is respectively slow compared to younger people , so their ability of enjoying life decreases a lot .
In short , young people has more high technology `` toys '' to play to make their life happier than older people do .

Moreover , young people have more friends than older people has .
Teengers are like to express their opinions with each other and they do not hide things with their friends , so they enjoy life more than older people do .
However , based on the ability of communication skills , older people are unable to in touch with huge numbers of friends .
As a consequence , they are lack of friendship .
Hence , few friends make older people unable to enjoy life more than young people do .

Lastly , the willing of some exciting advantures of teengers are higher than older people .
Almost every teengers are like travelling because they want to explore some exciting advantages .
Nevertheless , older people have given these kinds of willings up long time before just because they are busy about their work and their energy is limited .
Therefore , teengers excitements drive them to become more happier .

To sum up , by listing three factors that I discussed above which sometimes they intertwine to become an organic whole and thus become more persuasive .
We can safely reach the conclusion that young people truely have a happier life than older people have .
