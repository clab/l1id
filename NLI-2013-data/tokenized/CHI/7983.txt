At first thought , this seems a good suggestion , but carefully weighing on the minds , we found that this statment has oversimplified the way we deal with travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
It is true that there are benefits to travel in a group lead by a tour buide , but backpacking or travelling without tour guide is much with merits .
Even these days , when people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , my belief remains that backpacking is a better way of travel .
Therefore , I disgree with the statement .

I would substantiate it in three reasons .
First reaons for my statement is that to travel alone we could schedule our time more flexibly .
Travelling without a tour guide , we could visit the places that we most want to go .
We will not encumber by others and can arrange our time during the travel .

Second , to travel alone without a tour guide , we could enjoy the process of doing our survey .
We could gain more knowledge broadly and deeply though the internet or from our friends .
The joyness not only comes from paying a visit , but also from the process of studying the places that we intend to go .

The final reason for my disagreement is that the tour guide might view or explain the place from his or her point of view , which might mislead us from the genuine concept or idea of one place .
People often have experience that a tour guide guide us to the most famous spot of one place but miss the most historical , meaningful spot .
It is only because that the guide considers where to visit in his own thinking , or his own benefits .

That is not to say , of course , that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is completely without merits .
Nevertheless , with the reasons I presented above , I disagree with the title statement .
I believe that backpacking or travelling without tour guide could bring the most elating experience though the travel .
