Someone says it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic sudjects than to specialize in one specific suject .
I ca n't agree on this statement .
Because obtaining specialize knowledge is more inportant than obtaining broad knowledge of variuos subjects .
My statement mainly based on the following reasons : First , with the bloom of the information development , it is mostly impossible the obtain all the knowledge of one specific subject , not to metion obtaining all the knowledge of a broad range of subjects .

What was the use of a person who spend all his life in learning all the knowledge in the world , but doing nothing to used what he learn to contributed to the society ?

Second , to obtain that many knowlegde is a very time consuming process .
Sometime it could be a waste of time .
And to choose a wide range of subjects means to secrify the depth of the things you learn .
This may lead to a person difficult to live in a world that most , if not all , of the works are specificly cassify .

And the most important reason is that , what a person will focus in his or her life , is usually one or tow field , it is really not nessesary to studied too many subjects , learning too much may not do any good to our future .
Why do n't we use the time we spend on the knowledge that may never be used in our life to something more related to ourself ?
Who will need to know how to cure AIDS when your job is the programming software to a supermaket ?

In sum , I think that knowlegde are important to all of us , and it is a good thing to know more of the .
But the more important things is how to use our limited time to learn the specific knowledge that will more likely be used in our life , but not wasting our life of what may come useless to us .
