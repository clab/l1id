I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation .

First , there are too many amusing activities to do .
New high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stick on those things .
Big companies uses strong advertisement and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spending time on the products .
Moreover , interacting with friends takes most of young people 's time .
All of these activities occupied every minute of them .

Second , the education from young people 's parents does not give them the idea .
To live in a competetive world , children are taught to learn knowledges as much as they can and give attention to other things as less as they can .
Cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around .
They are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades .
Due to this twisted concept , young people are not interested in communities activities .

Third , the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action .
People refuse to give time helping their communities because of bad news .
A crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help .
Teenagers can be in trouble because their lack of experience on helping the communities .

Above all , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
By observing those who live around , we can find out that young people will help if the negative conditions are removed .
Creating a nice and friendly environment for teenagers to open their mind will be the best way to let them give more time on communities activities .
