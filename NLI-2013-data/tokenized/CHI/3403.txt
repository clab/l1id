It is claimed that teenagers nowadays have less time to commit themselves to activities other than academic pursuits ; they do not give enough time to helping their communities .
However , I disagrees with the claim , as in the perspective of a young student , I still see a lot of young people squeeze out time to help their communities .

In my school , there are a lot of organized programmes for students to engage in to help their communities .
We are offered precious opportunities to visit old folk homes and valuable chances to ask for donations for disabled children .
I was also proud that I participated in activities for charity organisations to perform harmonica in public to gather donations from people .
There are a lot of students who are also actively involved in community programmes to fulfill themselves and to contribute to society and their communities through whatever ways they can .

Last year , local universities stop to use Community Involvement Programme ( CIP ) as a criterion for admission of freshman applicant .
The main reason is that the Ministry Of Education ( MOE ) wishes to discourage students from participating in community programmes for the sake of earning CIP hours , which was used as a criterion for university admission .
However , after MOE has discarded the old system , there are still a lot of students who engage actively in community work , which is a testimony to the fact that most students are helping their communities to contribute to society not , for the sake of getting into a university .

In addition , given the ample opportunities for yound people to help their communities , many have take advantage of the organized school activities to experience the real life of poor people .
Nowadays , people are generally more affluent than before , but there are still a lot of unfortunate people who cannot escape from the vicious cycle of poverty .
Thus , some students from wealthy families take advantage of their opportunity to go overseas to help poor people .
In my school , there are organized programmes for students to travel to Thailand and other poor areas to help to teach the poor students who are deprived of the opportunity to learn in a comfotable classroom as we do .
Every year , there are a lot of students who apply for the programme , to the extent that our school has to select students for the overseas trips .
Many students are compelled to help the poor people .
Those who are given the opportunity to travel abroad also ask for the whole school population to donate books and unused stationaries to the poverty stricken students .

Therefore , in conclusion , despite the hectic schedules of comteporary young people , I still think that many youth sincerely wants to contribute to their communities and help to make the world a better place for all homo sapiens to live in , regardless of race , language or religion .
