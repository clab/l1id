Personally , I am disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my opinion , I have three reasons to support my saying , they are the increasing community service certification , the sense of youth social responsibility , and the expend concept of international community .

Firstly , the increasing community service certification among campus .
For example , there are more and more universities provide community service certification to encourage students to contribute more time to helping their communities .
Under the improvement of community service certification , more young people are eager to give more time to do so .

In addition , the sense of youth social responsibility is addressed among society recently .
For instance , a lot of NGOs hold seminasr and conferences to bring youth people together to discuss the issue of youth social responsibility .
Meanwhile , more young people express their opinion on internet platform and implement action among their communities .
Furthermore , the development of techonology bring chances and channels for youth people to contribute their thoughts and effors for community service .
For example , I have joined an online conference which was about youth community action , mainly connected between Taipei and Kaohsiung .
To decrese the cost of transportation and physical attendance time , I still had the opportunity to express my opinion and had the smooth interaction with other participants .

Finally , The expend concept of international community arises .
According to the idea of globalization , there is no limitation among countries , especially there is no barriers between commmunities .
For instance , I can easily reach another community to have cooperation for improving my community 's weakness .
Moreover , the use of technology for communication , young people develop their potential to make positive impact to helping their communities internationally .
For example , I had a discussion forum on my blog of September , 21st earthquake recovery several years ago .
There were quite vast young people replied and gave me advices to make some improvements for my community .

To summarize , the increasing community service certification among university fields , the addressed sense of youth social responsibility , and the international community concept are main support evidence to prove that young people nowadays do make efforts and give a lot of time to helping their communities .
