I disagree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
Because by learning the fact of something , students will really learn the experience and the knowledge .
Also by learning the fact of that thing , students can understand the idea deeply and clearly .

When students are facing something , if student only think about the idea of that thing , students will only think about how to solve the problem .
But by doing that , students will forget to think about the reason .
Why does it happen , how does it happen .
If students learn the facts of the thing , they will get the answer , the how and why and something else .
And by learning the fact of the thing , they will really learn experience and knowledge from the thing , not just do it .
I have a friend who is in the Yearbook team of our school .
She is not as good as other students in the team because when she got a problem , she will ask the teacher how to solve the problem , which is right .
But she never thinks about why the problem appear .
When the teacher gave her the idea of the issue , she only follow the idea and solve the problem without thinking .
By doing that , she does n't really learn the knowledge and skill .
When the same problem happen next time , she still ca n't solve it .
So , learning the fact is more important than understand the ideas .

Also , by learning the fact of the thing , students will get more chance to learn about the thing , therefore , they will get the idea of the thing easily and clearly also deeply .
Because they learned about it .
After we learn the fact we will know the idea very easily and deeply .
I have a friend who goes to art class with me .
When the teacher talk about the idea of a piece of art , he always ca n't understand .
That 's because he does n't study for that art .
He does n't know the background of the art and who the artist is and so on .
So it 's very hard for him to understand the art only by looking at it .
So learning the facts of the issue helps students to understand the ideas and concept .

After all , learning facts is more important for students than only understand the ideas and concepts .
Students will gain lots of knowledge and experiences by learning the facts .
