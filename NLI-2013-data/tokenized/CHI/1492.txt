when considering this issue , some people agree that it is better to specialize in one specific subject while others seem to agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
As to me , I agree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Currently , in this democratic and economic-free world , we need people with variable abilities no matter where they belog .
People who are used to working alone may be disliked because every work seems to be created by `` coporation '' in today 's society .
`` Coporation '' means respecful and multi-cultural .
Only through it may human beings create a better consequece of their work .

Therefore , it is not the matter how much quantity one can contribute to the group but quality one can produce by his own , even that a little bit but precious knowledge , which suddenly occurs to his brain , may come to a significant key to success .

I remembered one time we classmates had a huge project to be done , something related to `` Fantasy Literature . ''
We were terribly nervous about that presentation because finally we decided to talk about the great volume , `` The RIng of The King . ''
We spent a week for preparation from searching to powerpoint .
Actually , only two of us had finished the three books , and others just `` tried '' to understand some episodes .
However , we did make efforts to use variable angles to do analysis , especially when we began other related books reading .
So , when the day of the presentation was coming , we group not only had full preparation about the main top but also some materials developed by our extra reading stuffs .

Through this experiece , I realize that it is not matter how much you have learned but what more you can possibly give out , which is being developed and potentially erupted by individual efforts .
Therefore , in my opinion , I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
