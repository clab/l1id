While there is a common accepted idea that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way of making a travelling , I am not satisfied by this form of my tour based on my own experiences and knowledge .

First of all , travelling in a group means you should adapt yourself to the others in the same group .
Unfortuately , it is not a rare phenomenom that people cannot adjust himself or herself to another person 's habit .
A apt evidence to illustrate this is my personal exiperience when I had my trip to Yangzi River with a group .
I was totally scared and disrupted by a man in the same group for he always made horable sounds while sleeping .
And the habit is not the whole story , another thing is you have to adjust your own schedule according to the time table shared among the team , which means you have little control of your time .

Moreover , travelling with the guide may suffer the risk of the incompability of the guide .
Many guides are just graduated from school and lack of adequate experiences in order to be a compatable guide in a group .
These greenhands might make peccadiloes , flaws or even severe errors during their administration of the whole group .
A recent study conducted by CNATE ( Chinese National Association of Travelling Enterprises ) shows that about 27 percent of guides are recruits .
Although the pecentage seems not high , the possibility still exists , and once it happens , it will surly served as a joy-killer .

At last , travelling with a group means the loss of privacy .
It is hard to imagine how the privacy can be kept if I have to travel with a group for the whole tour .

Admittedly , travelling in a group together with a tour guide still has its own merits .
For example , you can enjoy the trip without many considerations such a schedual , fare , to name a few .
That is why there are many people have there preference on this kind of travelling .
However , I am still inclined to individual travelling .
And I am still treasuring a unshakable belief that true satisfaction of travelling can be only found in travelling alone .
