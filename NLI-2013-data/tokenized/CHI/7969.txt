As the development of transportation , people travel more .
The most common way of travelling is like this : going to a travel agency , flying to a place with a group people , listening what the tour guide said and flying back .
I do n't , however , admire this `` common way '' and never consider it the best way of travelling .

The biggest problem brought by having a tour guide is the absence of freedom .
You have to go to one place after another exactly as the fixed plan .
The schedule was full of different arrangements and you could rarely get the chance of walking around alone in such circumstances .
For instance , I once went to Hong Kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of people and a tour guide .
As soon as she met me in Hong Kong , she started to complain about her trip .
She said that she could n't go to the place she really wanted , eat food she liked , and even the shops she loved .
All she did was taking buses to different places and walking around as a walking machine .
She was very upset about her trip and did n't find any pleasure in it .

Another nightmare brought by group touring is shopping -- a group of tourists are often brought into a shop by the tour guide and forced to buy products .
This is quite true in some coutries according to my own experience .
Since guides could get money from the shops , you may be badly treated by the tour guide if you did n't buy anything .
Nobody could have a nice trip in such cases , is n't it ?

For me , I prefer going to places myself , without a tour guide or other unknown people .
When I travelled to Hong Kong , I only booked my plane tickets and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agency .
My travel is like this : I walked in the streets of Hong Kong , went to those small local shops that a tour guide would never introduce to you , eat those really `` Hong Kong '' food that you may never eaten in a big restaurant , and talked with local people about their daily life .
These are things you could never have when attending a group and led by a guide .
Leading by a guide is an experience of `` viewing and listening '' , but not travelling ; only when you walked in a city or a place of interest on your own , can you find its charm and fall in love with travelling .
