In my opinion , travelling is a process for people to broaden their views fo world , to learn and share with others ' culture and to adjust their mind and body into a harmonic way .
And this whole process for travelling is neither necessarily in group nor led by the tour guide .

First of all , with the fast-pace improvement of information technology , one can go on the internet and search for any detailed information for any area .
There is not so many needs for a guide to tell you what the history and riddles of the scene are , instead we can easily find those information we want on the internet .

Secondly , the guided group are more likely to have a schedule on when and what to travel .
This is obviously against the nature of the travel , we need more time to talk to people and share the wisdom of life , which seems a tough and even impossible task for the tour guide , since to some extent , they had to follow the simple principle , time is money .
If we travelled by ourself , we can arrange our time freely , if there is a point of intersest that attract you a lot , we can reschedule it to go back one day later or even more .

Thirdly , we can know where our money spend when travelling by ourself , there is no way that you know the same thing when you give the money to the tour guide .
It sometimes ruins my mood of travelling by suspecting that the guide may keep some of our money to his own pocket .
Also , some guide may pull you to some restaurants or local shops that are not attractive to us at all , which in return the restaurants and shops give bonus back to the guide .
To me myself , I will feel cheated under such circumstance .

In summary , I am against the statement in the question .
