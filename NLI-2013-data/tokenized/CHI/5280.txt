Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Most people will not doubt about it , while others think quite differently on the issuse of the advertisements do n't make products seem much better .
Personally , I stand on the side of the advertisement make products seem much better .
There are three conspicuous concepts as follows .

Firstly , this is because of the simple fact that the examples you will meet in your life .
Many many times , when we see the advertisements in the TV or any where , the products in the advertisement are very perfect , excellent , so after receiving them , you are very disappointed .
The real products are not like the patterns in the advertisements .

Secondly , we could cite another ordinary example of that the advertisements are also the businesses , they also want to get the money from the customers .
So sometime , when they do the advertisements , they do n't worry about the quality of the products , and maybe they do n't understand the detail informations about the products , they just focus on how do the advertisements , how to make the customers to trust what they said .

Thirdly , I may say that the advertiser are not the experts about the different areas .
So they just need to make the advertisements look better , and let the customers believe the products , let the producer get the maximum profits , this is the rule of the market .

Certainly , some advertisements also do the good job .
They just tell the truth about the products to customers .
And try not to give the wrong information to public .
So some people believe that most advertisements do n't make products seem much better than they really are .

Of course , arguments will be against my standpoints , many people might argue that my opinions also have some drawbacks , Such as there are still some good advertisements .
I might reply that most important things are multifaceted , there are many alternatives to choose from , each with uniqe advantanges and disadvantanges .
I advocated my viewpoints because I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Above all this points , I support to statement because it is better to know that the advertisements are also businesses , Their main goal is also the profit , the money .
So we should n't give the advertisements more belives .
