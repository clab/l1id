I totally agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Can the internet sparkle the interest of older people as it does to young people ?
The answer is definitely positive .
But can them have the possibility to log on the internet ?
The feedback is neganive .
Older people have no chance to learn the typing skill or the skill to surf on the internet systematically because they are too far away from the schooling life .
Thus , they seldom enjoy themselves by surfing on the internet .

If the keeping away from the internet which can provide the more abundant entertainment than ever before cannot to be a persuasive one , just consider the basic one .
Food is commonly ageed to be an enjoyment to all .
But older people more or less have the problem in metrabolism , or digestion .
They want to enjoy the delicate foods but they find they are difficult to enjoy them freely .

In addition as we all know that costume which is one of four basic neccesities in the daily life is everchanging .
When man creates the costume , they treat them as the decoration besides protection them from the cold weather .
When you dress yourself in the most fashionable clothes , you will feel very confident and surely very happy .
Nevertheless , There are seldom fashionable costume designed for or targeted to older people .
Hence older people hardly enjoy the fantastic thing as young people do .

Some say that maybe the modern world is only a place which is suitable for young people .
To some extend concerning the points above , I agree with that .
It is a pity for older people to live in such a world where they seem to be abandoned by younge people and the rest of the world .
What can we do to offer more enjoyment for older people is a serious question we all shoulsd strive to figure out .
