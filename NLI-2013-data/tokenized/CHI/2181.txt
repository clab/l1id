Nowadays , young people usually use most of their time socializing with their buddies , having parties , go surfing , go skiing and have .
They enjoy their life so much .
They think they have so much time to spend with .
They do n't need to worry about getting old .

Yet , most sophiscate older people find their ways of life .
They find their goal , their dream and they are keeping forward in their life .
Cause they had been young , they knew they made some wrong decision before .
They are willing to make it up for them and make a better life .
To me , I disagree young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Day in and day out , it is not hard to find young people commit suicide , they take drug and go to rave parties .
It seems they are so enjoy with their life .
In fact , they are wasting their precious time .
Numerous of young people try to have different kind of leisure in order to get rid of their stress like exam , complicated love relationship , family scold .
In contrast , most older people have experience to know what mistakes they did on the past , they feel everyday is a good day , they enjoy their lifes .
They feel life is too short .
Besides , they usually have more capitals to let them do more things like traveling .
Most voluntaries are from older people , they are more willing to give .
They want to help people who are indeed .
This is exactly what life should be .
Life is about happiness , older people arrive a destination that they can share their joy to other people .

Next , when you see older people , you will always find a happy face from them .
It is because they realize that life is running fast .
So many worries that they had had before was not a big deal .
Their valuable experience provides them with a critical thinking .
They mostly choose a better choices than young people do .
It always give a better result .
This critical thinking makes their life easier and enjoy the fruitful result in their life .
