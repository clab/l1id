Some people argue as if it is a general truth that most advertisements do n't make products seem better than they really are .
However , to be frank , I ca n't agree with them .
As far as I am concerned , I think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Among countless factors why I hold no confidence on them , there are three conpicuous aspects as follows .

The primary problem with the statement is that it is ignorant to the basic fact that advertisement is used to sell products .
Therefore , the advertisements will make the products become what the customers hope and like in order to sell them , which is the purpose and the most common methods of most advertisments .
For instance , nobody would like to eat a hamburge which is tiny and over-cooked , instead customers want to have some big and godlooking ones .
That 's why people always find that the hamburgers they eat in the restuarants seem smallerthan those in the commercials .

Another reason why I disagree with the above argument is that the advertisements will only mention the advantages of the products .
This is also a kind of misleading customers .
Take some medicine as an example , the advertisement never tell you what the bad effects of the medicine will happen after you use it .
The words you can hear are only `` use XXX , use it , make you feel totally comfortable ...
about your illness . ''

Finally , what is also worthy noticing is that some words in the advertisements may have different meanings .
This makes the consumers may easily misunderstand those words .
Such as some promotion advertisement , you can get one free product without mantion u have to buy something else first .

All in all , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Some make the product much better look , some only mention the good aspects , and others use some trick words to make people misunderstand .
Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
