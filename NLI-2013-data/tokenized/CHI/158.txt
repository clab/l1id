Will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
My opiniont is yes .
I believe with the development of breaking technology today that will lead the world to a brand new transportation time and cut down the cars in use .

Every morning in the rush hour , we can see the traffic jam and serious air pollution around us .
People suffer from that and our children live in a worse environment .
It makes many goverments of countries set way to result this big problem and want to bring a better life to their citizents .

Recently , we found that there is fewer and fewer gasline left on the world .
This problem pushes human to creat a new style of transportation .
Goverment starts to establish public transportation and encourage citizents to use that well .
Everyone has the responsibility to protect our earth .

Besides , evironment issue has been raising for these few years .
People around the world graduately focus on the protection way of our environment .
Therefore , most people will follow the goverment 's order to try their best to use public traffic like subway , skytrain .

To sum up , I believe 20 years can bring a lots of changes .
The changes include people 's manner and technology .
People realize the importance of our earth and make action to do something and technology will help people to find a better way to live .
Therefore , I believe taht the numbers of car will decrease in twenty years .
That 's also my hope .
