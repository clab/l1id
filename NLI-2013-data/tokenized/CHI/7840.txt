This topic is not easy to answer directly .
Depending on the personal experience , everybody will have the different answers .
Some people will agree meanwhile some will disagree instead .
In my point of view , travelling in a group led by a tour guide or by themselves is related to the conditions and personal abilities at any rate .

Both to travel in a group led by a tour guide and go trip on their own have countless advantages .
Im my opinior , I would like to travel along when I am above 20 years old .
It is because that I can enjoy the trip in the processing not only the result .
For example , I can choose the bike-trip and go anywhere I would like to go in China .
I can stay more time when I have been interested in it .
I can go to the place the tour guide will not lead us to go .
I think it is the strongest point the people will choose to travel by themselves .
The most essential advantage is that during the trip , we can improve our skills and abilities learned from the school and out of the school .
I think have a trip on your own is a unforgettable in your life .

In contrast , I think it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide when I am just a student .
There is no doult that the tour guide will arrange all the things during the trip such as where we live , what we eat , where we should go and when we should spend money .
It is easy for us to follow .
The most significant advantage is that before the trip , we do n't need to do any work about the trip and make a schedual .
It is a comfortable way and convenient for us to have a trip .

However travel in a group led by a tour guide have a lot of advantages , you also can choose travel on your own .
It is up to you .
