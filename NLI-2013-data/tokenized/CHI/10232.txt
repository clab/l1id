I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
As we all know , creativeness and courage are very important qualities that lead a person to success .
As in nowaday 's intense competition , well-round development also plays a crucial role .

Successful people are not a majority in the society .
The reason they outstand others is that they find a new way that others have not found or dare not to go .
The famous example of Bill Gates sheds light on this point .
Bill Gates went to a prestigeous university .
However , he did not stay in school until gratuation , as most people usually do .
Instead , he quit school after two years and devoted to a new field interesting he -- computer , which was then not common .
The courage to try new things eventually brought tremendous success to him .

As one another contemporary successful entrepreneur , Donald Trump says , since you are to think , think big .
This infers daring to take risks is also a stepstone on the way to success .
If one only does what he already knows how to do well , he can do nothing other than this field .
That is to say , even if he is second to none in this category , in others , he is nothing more than a greener .
However , to be a successful people , expertise in a single , or limited range is far from enough .
One must be well-rounded , at least knowledgeable in general , to get to success , which is not an easy case at all .

After all , we can see trying new things and taking risks reveal a person 's extinguishing qualities such as creativeness , courage and well-round development , which are all indispensable factors to success .
Therefore , the statement is completely true .
