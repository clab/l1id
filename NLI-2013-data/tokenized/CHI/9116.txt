The issue of whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts .
Some people assert that understanding concepts is more important , while others believe that learning facts is more important .
Different people have different views due to their distinct backgrounds .
As a matter of fact , this issue is complex and controversal one and whether one choice takes precendence ovr the other may quite depend one the specific situation .
As far as I am concerned , I disagree with this statement and my view can be substantiated by the following discussion .

The first argument can be presented is ideas and concepts are usually unrealistic and un-practical .
A good example is about my major - physical therapiest .
Many of classmates could get good scores in the lecture , but they could not get good scores in the lab or being interns in the hospital because they could make a good connection between what they had learned and the clinic situation .

Under this circumstance , I really think learning facts is very important .

In addtion , there is another reasons to support my standpoint and a good example is not far to seek .
Before going abroad , people buy the travelling guide book and understand the environment and culture of the country to which they are going .
But sometimes , people feel what the book mentions is too abstract to understand and therefore , the best way is going that country and have the real experience .

Admittedly , it may be true understanding ideas and concepts is very basic and important for students in some specific situation .
However , this alone does n't constituate a sufficienct support to claim above statement .
Actually , these cases are rare and thus are too specific and too weak to strenthen this standpoint .
When the advantages and disadvantages of understanding concepts and learing facts are carefully examined , the most striking conclsuion is abvious that learing facts is much more important .

To sum up , although the statement still arouses diagreement among different people , the issue is quite difficut to resolve .
Taking into account the above-mentioned reasonses , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become to be more persuasive , we can arrive at the conclusion learing fact is more important to students than undersatdning ideas and concepts .
