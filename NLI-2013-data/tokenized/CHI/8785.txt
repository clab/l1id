The issue states whether it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts rather than learnig the fact .
Abusolutely this a comtroversal issue , and the reaction from the parents and teachers are tend to be very two polar sides , which means some of the teacher they stand for making students know the undestand concepts and ideas but not the fact , thus the student are turning to be blindly , for they do not know the fact and only follow with the ideas blindly ; additionally , it also restricts students about their thoughts .
The others , however , the teachers focus on teaching students about the fact but not the skill of understand the idea or accept the new concepts , therefore in terms of this students would be so easy to be stereotype , or cliche .
Or they will be treated as a essenctricity , as they never follow the social conceousnes without being realized that they have done something which is so extradonary .

As the all the above indicates , both of the very different two solutions have their own superior and perior as well , so in my opion I would prefer to stand the neutral side ; try to conbimnate with those two ideas , as it is better for students in case of being too stereotype , or abnormal .
Because students should to know the either concepts or facts at the same time before they judge something , also it is useful for avoiding students from staying at the wrong perception , in addition , it also help student not to be over-aspect , which means they are unable to consider thing around all itself , evenmore , somethimes they might go at the wrong direction , and so forth .

In conlusion , there is no necessary to fugure out whether it is more important for student to understad ideas and concepts rather than the fact , as it is not make sence for students on their perceptions and the way how to judge thing justified .
