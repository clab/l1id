I have to say that I agree with this statement which is it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject .
Although these subjects are acdemic and you just know broad knowledge of them , it must be reather helpful for your living and creer .
For example , you are a sudent whose major is Electronic Enginereen moreover you also know some contents about Accounting or Finance , in this case you have had potential power to own your business in the future because your knowledge is not limited by on specifialize .
Through these more kowledge from other subjects you extend your mental world and then naturally colourful your life .

The people who are appear around you must have kinds of job that focused on variety of subjects .
When you guys are conmmunicating with each other , just imagine that both of you are unfamiliar with each other 's job background or even both of you are just interested in and just know narrow region about what you twos speciallize .
How this talk can continue and I can think about how boring this talk will be .

Therefor , I can conclue that if you know broad knowledge of many .
I subjects
