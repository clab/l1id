I do not agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
And I prefer for travel alone even though I will face many unknown problems because I think it will save my time and I will go to anywhere I want to without limitation .

Many people have a traditional idea that they must be in a group led by a tour guide when they travel .
But I think it is incorrect since it will waste your time .
Whenever you move to a new place , you must follow the tour guide 's step and can not control your time by yourself .
What you should do is waiting all the time even though you have been exhausted .
Waiting for other people who belong to your group to prepare , and waiting for the tour guide 's tedious introduction of some famous buliding or carve which you are of interested of at all .
Eventually time is up , and you have not do what you are desired to except hearing the words `` Because of no time , let us go back '' by your tour guide .

The second thing is that you can go to any places you are interested in if you travel alone .
Without the tour guide you can go to the museum or theare which may not be included in the schecule of a group led by a tour guide .
You can go the shopping mall to buy whatever things you like instead of lining on the traveling group to shop in a mall which is the tour guide 's recommendation .
Finally you can alos have food in the restraunts where serve you well and make you feel gorgeous .

So above are my reasons that traveling by yourself can get lots of benefits .
If I you make a decision to travel abroad and want to have a good time , try to do it by yourself .
