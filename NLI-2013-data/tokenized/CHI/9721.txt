Nowadays , successful people always like to try new things and take risks in their lives .
i totally agree with this statement for some good reasons .
First of all , people like to say that `` it is never too old to learn '' .
We are still too young to stop trying and learning new things .
If we never try , we will never know what gonna happened .
Eventhough sometimes we would not be successful as a result of trying new stuff , we still can face the bad situation bravely and treat it as our treasure experiences in our life and we will learn from it as well .
For example , i came to Canada with my family two years ago , since we are not english speaker we had to learn english from `` ABC '' .
Eventhough that is really hard for us but we never stop our steps .
And my grandma is 80 years old now and she still wants me to teach her how to use internet .

Second , our world keeps changing ever single day .
If we stop learning , we will really fall behind so we must keep going for ourselves and our next generation .
Since everything in the world needs people to create an develope , we should never stop learning and exploring new things .

Third , In my point of view , some people give up or stop learning things because they are too lazy to try and they think that will be hard for them , on the other hand , they are kind of satisfied by their own situations .
Maybe that is really fine for them to stop going , but they will lose so many chance to be successful .
Maybe they will not suffer a lot from some hard experience but at they same time they will lose the chance to experience the exciting process .

Because no body can foresee the future so we should try our best and built a beautiful life for ourselves . : )
