Yes , i agree with this statement .
I think when students understand the ideas , of course they will learn the facts .
Firstly , students should n't concentrate on the facts , when they just starting to learn it .
I am a student , i know it is more important for me to understand how does the teacher think about the question and the way she thinks , what are the important points , and how can i catch it .
Therefore , i can translate it into my own way , and then i can find the facts .

Secondly , student suppose to know that we studying not only for the test or the deploma , we want to make us more knowledgable , so they should consentrate on the ideas but not the facts .
Athought the facts is also important , it is more important to understand the ideas .

Thirdly , as my opinion , i really prove that understand ideas is more important .
When i in the primary school in China , i learned all the basic algebra .
But at that time , i am too young to understand the ideas , so i just remebered the facts .
After i graduated , i went to amiddle school , i found that i completely confused about all i learned in primairy school .
So after that , i know to understand ideas and concepts than it is for me to learn facts .

I remebered that a famous author said : first , you should learn the facts , but after that it is more important for you to uderstand the ideas , the way that people using to think .

On the other hand , if you just learn the facts , you just copy the answer into your mind .
It is same like you eat the food which other people have already eaten .
Nobody wants to be a memory machine , students should be the people who invented the ideas .

In a word , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn the facts .
In that way , you are a wise person .
