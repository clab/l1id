The issue at hand is that learning through understanding ideas and learning through facts , which one is more important for students ?
This issue is very important , becasue learning knowledges and studying trough different methods are very important for the students future career .
I believe learning facts is more important , for some reasons .

Learning facts is preferable because facts offer a lot of experiences that are very rare , and also easily understandable .
Those experiences are from outside of the classrooms , they come from the real world , using these experience facts , students can learn knowledge faster , they will save time to study other knowledges .
This is very important for the students ' future career , the reason is that most of the employers are glad to hire employees who can work immedietely , since this kind of employees can bring the profits to company as soon as they are hired .
For example , operating a machine should n't be very hard for the students , because they have already understood those ideas and concepts , but when these students begin to work in the real factories for the first time , they are still confused about those operations , because they do n't have the experiences of operating those machines .
Based on this reason , learning factors is superior to understanding ideas and concepts , because learning concepts can only offer students general knowledge , concepts can not give students more skills about the real work .

Additionally , I believe learning facts is a right option because facts are usually more interesting and active , so , they can be remembered easily by the students .
Trying to think about this : concepts that only presents on the papers with black characters and videos shows the real production processes in a factories , which one is more attractive ?
which one would you like to choose ?
I believe the answer is very obvious .
So , I like learning facts over just understanding ideas and concepts due to the fanny that I can find in the learning the facts .

To sum up , I believe learning facts is the correct choice , I would choose this because I believe students can remember more knowledges when they learning facts , and also , facts include a lot of real experiences which is rare and very important for the students to start the future work .
