Gone is the age of closely-knitted society .
It is often suggested that nowadays , young people are less devoted to community sevice in terms of time .
In this essay , this statement will be examined in reasonably great depth .

For the purpose of effective analysis , clarification of the definition is needed .
What is the meaning of ` helping ' ?
In common sense , it means voluntary , unpaid , physical asistance such as taking care of the old people , cleaning public space and working for the underprivileged .
However , here , a broader definition is propsed .

The ` helping ' component also includes indirect assistance such as donation and political participation .
Also , what is ` enough ' ?
I propose that ` enough ' should be assessed with reference to the needs of the society .
Being members of society , young people are the most able and there the most willing group of potential helpers so whether the time devoted is enough should be judged on the basis of whether the help has met the needs of the society .

To begin with the ` common sense ' level , young people may really have given less time .
In modern societies , the overwhelming majority of young people tend to devote most of their spare time to personal entertainment such as TV games , pub gathering , disco nights etc ..
Although more time of entertainment is the natural and actually desirable result of the advancement of mankind , we cannot forget that to ensure the proper functioning of the society , young people also have the duty to help .
They benefit from the society so they should also benefit the society in return .
Therefore , the statement is true at common sense level .

However , the adoption of a broader definition of ` helping ' may lead to different result .
The increase in general education level undoubtedly has provided the young people with the necessary ability and awareness to participate in the liberal democratic system .
The young people can indirectly help the deprived by participating in social politics , by fighting for better social welfare , by lobbying the government for more resoruces and by acting as a bridge between the decision-makers and the people targeted by the policy .
Also , due to the high education level , many of the young people normally have a reasonably good income .
Obviously they can help the community in the form of regular and generous donation .
In wider context , they can act as the backbone of the economy and thereby generate enough economic resoruces for the social justice system .
They are just some of the ways in which the modern young people can help the society .

As to whether the current commitment of the young peole has satisfied the needs of the society , the answer is more uncertain .
Human wants are unlimited and the ones who need the help of young people are no exceptions .
Nevertheless , for pragmatic purpose , a reasonable line can still be drawn .
The current social justice system proves to be reasonably ` enough ' since it can provide most people with basic life-supporting stuffs such as food and shelter .
However , the answer to the question depends on the future performance of the social justice system which will be supported by the young people .

All in all , the validity of the statemnt is limited but we cano
