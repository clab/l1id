Do you agree or disagree that successful people try new things and thak risks rather than only doing what they already how to do well .
As far as I am concerned , I agree that successful people only try new things and taks risks .
In my opinion that successful people must have some kinds of the special capacibilitis that normal people do n't have .
These are my opinions in the following reasons .

First of all , I wander that what kind of people will have a lots of guts to become successful ?
They must obtain a greatness dream to stimulate them keep moving on .
For example , if they want to finish this hard work that boss ask for them to do , they must work on harder and harder , even no time to eat .
This target is one they want to achieve and want to get the boss 's praise , so they take the risk may become unhealth to conqure the goal .

Secondly , no pain , no gain .
I indicate the people who are willing to take the risk must have the scene of confidance .
For stance , there ca n't be complete the whole thing without confidance .
however , the successful people show their confidance in when they are find the way to deal with the problems and figure out the tough issues .

Moreover , the hard-wroking people represence the most confidance when they have no ways to do , they can utilize their individual ability to overcome the problems .

To sum up , I utter that the successful peopole that try new thing and take risks make them become success .
In the end , I will conclude my opinions by emphasizing .
People need to have the creatibility to think the new methods to deal with problems , espesially when they get stuck in the awful way .
