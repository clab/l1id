In modern society , we always face the dilemma whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .
It is such a debated problem in that it effects everybody in our life .
According to different backgrounds , people may have quite different choices .
Some may frown to it , because they think if they specialize in one specific subject , they can achieve more success , .
While others may say yes , since they perfer to contact with all kinds of knowledge .
When it comes to me , I tend to agree with the second opinion , that is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

To start with , broad knowledge is quite essential in social communication .
There is no denying that human are social beings , we need to communicate with others .
But it takes all sorts to make a world , some are teachers , some are doctors , and others may be scientists .
If we have no knowledge of other fields except your own learning area , it can be quite different to makes friends with them .
You may even do not know how to start a conversation , it can be quite frustrated .

Besides communication , there is another important point .
In certain times , some knowledge in other area is needed in our daily life .
Last summer , I went to a small town near the ocean with several friends .
We was deeply moved by the beautiful scenery there , the beach is always full of sunshine .
We loved to relax ourselves on the beach when the sun is setting sun , the breeze is blowing and seabirds are singing .
We went to a seafood restaurant nearby , the seafood there can be the best in the world .
But at this time , my friend felt quite uncomfortable .
At first all of us did not know what was wrong , suddenly I reminded a medcine book I have read before .
I happened to know that he seemed to be allergetic to this kind of seafood .
So I went to the clinic and bought the right medcine for him .
You see , sometimes these knowledge can be quite useful

`` It is always benefical to open a book '' as the old saying says , similarly , it is always benefical to gain knowledge , it can help us to know more about ourselves as well as this world .
So that this plant will be a better place to live in .

Based the discussion above , knowledge which is a integrel part in our life should always be required by human beings no matter which kind of knowledge .
