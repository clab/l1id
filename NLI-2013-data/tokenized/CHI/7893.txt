I 'm absolutely agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Travel in a group can solve the problem of boring because you can talk to people who share the commom interests as you are .

Furthermore , travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especilly to those chaotic areas in the destination .

And travel in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous places and worth seeing sceneries .
Because guide is a person know the place well and he know at which sesason , at what time , where is beautiful and he also can lead tourists to visit avoid the peak time which is very convient for tourists .

Then , travel in a group can make a lot friends during the vacation and can enhance the relationships .
OUr human beings are not isolated ones , we need to communicate .
And in the modern society , whatever organizations or bussiness companies oe even universities all require people have the abilities to work or study as a group .
I had an experience which was impressive .
When I was a junior high school student , my teacher asked us to draw a pitcure which we though is the most beautiful one .
So we began to draw seperately without disscusion .
After a while , each students showed their pitcures which all presented very pale in meaning except one which combine the work of two students and which showed a more meaningful and more various color in it .
Yes , the teacher wanted us to know sometimes work with our partner and shared both valuable things would attribute a amzing result which maybe could not predict .

If travel in a group , we can exercise the ability to be more cooperative and willing to help each other which will make our society more colouful and more competitive in the long run .

I highly recommend to travel in a gruop led by a tour guide .
