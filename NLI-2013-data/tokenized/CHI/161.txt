With the rapid development of society and technology , the cars we use today migh have something different in the future .
I strongly agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today twenty years later in consideration of economic , earth-friendly , and technological factors .

First , the great number of cars and the shortage of oil trouble many industrial countries in the world .
Generally speaking , cars are proved to be the worst efficient transportation .
It is because that we usually drive alone but a car can take at least four people at a time .
The space is not used is a waste of time and money .
People will rethink about the necessarity of driving cars , especially when the price of the oil is so expensive .
Driving cars is not an economic choice at all today .

The second reason why I think cars will be replaced soon is that cars bring out too many disadvantages to both human and the earth .
Even though that sometimes people think that it is very convenient to drive a car , it cause more pollution than we expect , such as noise and air pollution .
Many studies show that the air pollution caused by cars have negative impacts on the fertility of animals .
Not mention that the noise pollution causes health problems .
Therefore , I think the natural resource on earth , the most precious treasure shared by all human and animals , should be protected by using less cars .

Lastly , technologies will change the way of life when it comes to the desperate needs of customers .
Many scientists and businessmen today are looking forward to having some new mass transit system or inventions to replace the cars .
Take the Internet for example , people can take online course and do online shopping without driving out .
Hence , maybe twenty years later , we do not need cars to go to another place .
Instead , we can do all the things by the aids of technologies in communication and transportation .

In summary , I believe that the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years for cars consume too much oil , cars cause a series of pollution , and more cutting-age mass transit system will be provided .
As a result , I think that the decreasing of cars will be just around the corner .
