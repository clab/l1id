There is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reasons .
Firstly , it is getting expensive to own and use a car .
Scarcity has driven the prices for oil and the raw materials for manufacturing of cars up to an almost unacceptable level .
Also , car usage adds onto the already serious air pollution and global warming problems with their exhaust .
The economical and environmental reasons encourage people to switch to a cheaper and cleaner mode of transportation - the mass transportation .

However , I believe that there will not be significantly fewer cars in use twenty years from now on .
Firstly , with the rise of many third world countries such as China and India , many more individuals will be able to replace their cheaper vehecles , such as bicycles and motorcycles , with cars .
Not only because of the luxury , they will be able to travel to further places more frequently .
Economic advancements also encourage researches on greener energy .
In the future , cars with inbuilt solar panels may become the major vehicles on the road .
Besides using solar energy , a greener way of travelling can also be achieved with reduction in car sizes .
There may be options varying from one seat personal cars to six seats family mini vans .
The lack of metals for car manufacturing can also be solved with technology .
Researches on strong materials such as carbon nanotubes may serve to replace today 's steel sheets .

Cars , just as many other items we have in modern lifestyle , provides us with tremendous convenience .
Yet , they bring about problems that may one day lower our quality of life .
However , instead of escaping , we should confront the problems with better solutions .
Hence , there will be more cars instead of fewer , just greener and smaller , twenty years later .
