Some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However , others disagree .
In my opinion , I think the former statemment is true .
This is because young people are energetic , brave , and chanllengable .

Young people always have energy to do many things .
For example , they will use their free time to hang out with their friends .
They will go to some places to enjoy themsleves as clubs , bars , and movie centers .
Furthermore , young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than stay at home .
They are afraid of grounding because it is indispensible for them to have fun .

In addition to being engergetic , people who are young have bold to enjoy their life .
For instance , they try to do things which older people afraid to do .
Like ferry wheels .
One can conceive a 80-year-old man sitting on the ferry wheels will almost kill him , but not a young person .
They are always being curious about new things .
Moreover , they will not bother how much money have they left .
Instead , they will have a great time to spend the money to find their dream beautiful life .

Finally , young people can endure the chanllenges .
A example is , they will chanllenge new stuff to know the right way to enjoy life even including doing drugs .
On the other hand , older people prefer a peaceful life .

It is clear that I agree with the statement because young people have energetic spirits both pysically and mentally .
Therefore , they will not feel tired by having fun in their lives .
Also , they are never afriad to pursuid their happiness in their lives .
Lastly , they are the people who can be chanllenged to enjoy life .
For the previous reasons , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
