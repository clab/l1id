I do n't agree with the statement about most advertisements make their products better than they really are .
It undoubtful give some fake permitions to people and would makes nobody to believe any advertisements any more .

There was an old adverticment about Mallbore .
In that advertisment an actor who always acted as a cowboy was showing in it .
This advertisment made people , especially young men believed smoking was relativing to `` cool '' .
However , this actor died of lung cancer finally .
But the fact is that nobody knows during his life time how many young died or would die an same reason because of this fake advertisment .
Thus this kind of advertisement really does bad thing to people .

It 's hard to deny that there really are some advertisements are true , good to people .
But , ask youself , how much dare you believe in advertisements , because you cannot point out which of them is real .
Depend on the same reason , nowadays , advertisments are not a way to tell people what kind of product they can buy , instead they are becoming are kind of boring show on TV .
So the bad advertisement harm the people who believe them , and at the same time they hurt this field , too .

From these reasons , I think nobady would n't agree with my situation , especially those who were cheated by some bad advertisements .
I was worked in this field , so I could see both of these .
So I hope it would not happen again .
