I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
To begin my passage , I would like to provide my own experience happened in my home stay family .
It snowed heavily last years in Vancouver .
When faced with such snow , different member in the family have totely different reactions .
The homestay-father and mother thought it was a big mass to be cleaned up , they hate the snow .
However , the child in the family , who was only seven years old , was very happy to see so , because she has never seen such heavy snow in her life .
She can enjoy herself in the snow for a whole afternoon .

Why young people enjoy life more ?
First , because they usually have less life experience .
In such manner , they are more curious than adult .
Young people just want to try new things , even though older people may think it was bad .
Also they have less experience to see bad things .
Sometime , they do not have the ability to tell good things from bad ones , so they may engoy both of them .

In addition , adult , older people , are usually under lot of presures , which are not only from daily work , but also from their families .
They may think something was a trouble while their children think it is enjoyable to play with , just like the story above .

Last but not least , young people usually want gain different experience in life .
They would like to discouver different things in their life .
In this case , they may have more opportunities to approve interesting things in daily life .
When meet these kinds of things , they can have more enjoyment , so young people enjoy that more than older ones .

All in all , people of different age have different opinions to their life .
But , in general , young people enjoy their life more than people of an older age .
