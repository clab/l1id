There is a general discussion today on the issue of whether the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with this statement .
There are several reasons I want to show you .

First of all , the company need to make better advertisements to attract more people to buy their products .
If the advertisements looks bad , no one wants have it .
For example , the icecream seems very pretty in the picture or on the TV .
In additon , in the advertisements when a person eats it always show amazing expressing because the taste is so good .
From that , we do be attracted .
So we choose buy one , but it always not as good as the advertisements .

In the second place , when we saw the advertisements on TV or whatever other place , we may expect the real goods are better than the one they showed us .
It is obvious that our mind influenced us when we saw the realy one behind we already saw the advertisements .
That the one reason why we often feel the products seem much better than they really are .
The thinking of long for the better thing plays an important role in our community .
That why I believe this statement .

I think also there are some advertisements may make products the same like they really are .
However , the others which seem better than the real one are more outweight it .
In conclusion , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make better than they are
