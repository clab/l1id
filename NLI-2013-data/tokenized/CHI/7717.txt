There are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better , but others prefer to travel single instead of tour guide leading .
But I would have to say , if I was faced with this issue , I would probably follow the tour guide 's leading in a group .
In the following discussion , I would like to reason and provide examples to support my viewpoint .

No issue is more important now than the one that refers to safety .
History witnesses and presents many examples , that travelling by oneself may meet some dangers or troubles .
For example , we go to a less level country , such as China , and take money on hand , this behavors may suffer some dangers .
Or when we travel an Eurpeon country with unpolited dressing .
Do n't you think the examples quoted above are very persuasive ?

Convenience is another head and chief reason that I have chosen to put it here .
It is no better illustration that can demostrate the view .
If the trip is not convenience , it will take the travellers too many energy to enjor their trips .
Even familier as a couples .
they will be unconvenient on a busily trip .

Superior as leading by a tour guide , leading by tour guide or deciding trip by self also has own demerits , too .
Deciding trip course may spends many time and may lose something interesting .
Leading by a tour guide may lose one 's freedom to find something else beside the tour .

Nevertheless , the advantages of leading by a tour guide carry more weight than that of the disadvantage of leading by a tour guide .
So the most striking conclusion is obvious .

To sum up , given the reasons discussed above , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive , we can safely to reach the conclusion taht leading by a tour guide in a trip is more safe and convenience .
In fact , not only do I prefer to travel leading by a tour guide in a group , but also prefer to hire a personal tour guide for one 's own tour guide to serve himself as well as possible .
