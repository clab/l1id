I do n't agree that poeple saying to unbderstand the concepts and ideas is important that they learn form the facts .
Idea and concept are the major factors of learning , but not the overall .
The reason i saying that is Idea and concept are just a text or a sentenes .
They were not alive .
The main point of learning is learing how to live .
There is a millian fo situation will happen in our life which the concept ca n't tell .
Let say a subject we widly studying - Econ .
There is a lot of concept in the economic text book , is n't it ?
Altough the student can memorize it , but could they recognize it ?
I do n't think so , beause i have been this situation before .
Student can always memorize the concept when they are studying teh course .
They could do really well in teh exam .
However , could they answer you again at the next semestor ?
Maybe they would , but it would not happen at three semestor after .
Learning is about our whole life , but not for a moment only .
We learn someting when we are young , then it would be a weapon for us to fight the hard time we have in the future .

How about learning the facts or learning in the real life ?
Imagine how do you learn to walk ?
I think is walking , right ?
However , what is the reason we could memorize to walk for the whole life ?
because we did walking every singlt day .
Well , let say an example to make more sense .
Compare with two man who are on the same age .
One man have work about business for five years .
The other one is just start his business but he did finish teh whole university business course .
Well , who do you think is the man could handle a hard-time ?
The first man , for sure .
Becasue he got experience and the `` real '' ability .

People wil say a good knowledge migh help a lot .
Yes , they are right .
Nevertheless , learning fact equal learning the way we use the concept and idea .
That is the formula to be a succesful man .
