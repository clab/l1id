I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .

From the simple obversation , young people have more activites in their everyday life than the older people .
They go out for travels , go sporting , or dancing , and so on .
They seem enjoy life more than the older people .
But it is superficial .
We ca n't get the conclustion just from the more activites they take .
Whether it is enjoying life or not depends on the quality , motivation , emotion of entertaiments and other deep factors .

The motivations and quality of activities differ between the young people and the older people .
This leads to the fact that the older people more enjoy life than the young people when doing entertainments .
The older people usually have more spare time than young people .
Therefore , when they do their actitives , they really enjoy their times .
But for young people , a lot of pressures always make their activites rush or pushy .
Most of time , the activities of young people just help them release and relax a little bit , because they will put themselves into tougher situations later or they just are exausted from a very tough time .

The deeper factors affecting the conclusion come from social and psycholigical side .
The society usually gives more expectations to young people .
On the other hand , the young people are still in the developing period .
Thus , there are many uncertainties enfronted by the young people .
They need to develop themselves , recognize the society , and adjust themselves into the world .
Therefore , for the young people , chanllenges and unstability are good for them but they really bring many difficulities or obstacles for them , including physically and mentally .
It is really hard to say thta they enjoy their lifes while facing so many problems .
But for the older people , they have already experience most of their lifes .
They are more calm , and stable .
So , they are more enjoying their current time .

In sum , young people do n't enjoy life more than older people do .
