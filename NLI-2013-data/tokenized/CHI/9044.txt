In this topic , some student prefer learn the facts , others believe understand ideas and concepts is better .
Nevertheless , I believe understand ideas is better than learn the facts .

First of all , students will usually choose to learn facts when they started the course .
Because the facts is easily to understand and it is ineresting .
But there are some disadvanage about learn facts .
It hardly to catch the main ideas , students may only interesting on the stories , but did n't know the meanning .
It ca n't happen when you take focus on the ideas or the concepts .
Because the concepts and ideas are the standard about whole stories .

In addition , students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content about this course .
Although the facts can let them know how to use it on the society , it still limitied .
However we ca n't refuse it can leads students get some experiences .
It still not general for the students .

Finally , the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course .
The facts concluding different type of knowledge .
They are all useful .
But the knowledge which are concetin about the course may lead students to the wrong way .
They may try to take more focus on other course .
It is better to teach them the ideas and the concepts , couse the ideas and concepts can keep leading students on the correct way about the course .

Although I believe understand ideas is better than learn the facts , it still helpful to learn the facts .
The facts can give students some experience to let them do n't take the same mistake like the previous people .
But the ideas and concepts are the key of the studying .
It is the rule about the course .
