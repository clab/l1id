Even though helping cimmunities gradually becomes a social issue , I still think many young people do not really care about their communities and give enough time to helping their communities .
There are some reasons are listed as follows .

The main reason , nowadays the internet is very popular , and many news report that too many youbg people spend too much time on the internet .
Those reports say that the internet is too attractive that causes young people can not conerntrate on their schooling .
If young people can not do their schooling well , how do you think they will give another time to helping their communities .

Another , young people are hard to concern what other pople need at the ages .
Young people always care about what is cool and wnat to be special .
Especially , nowadays culture will lead the stituation become sever .
The movies and music are always looking for astonishing and cool things , and do not really care about the social issues .
Young people are the mostly effected ages .
They may be controlled by nowadays fashion culture and they do not know .

In short , there are more and more attractive things that young people can do and the circustance does n't show the correct perspective , how can you think these young people will give enough time to their communities .
