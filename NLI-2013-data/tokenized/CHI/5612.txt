The modern society provide us voraity of visual activty as advertisements .
Beyond the real qlity and quntitl of the product itself , I think many advertisements make products seem much better hn they are .
Two reasons for the greement .
Advertisements make better view of the products as esier to sell the products , also it concernt about the iamge of proucts for better economic effect .
Therefore , I strongly agree with the statment , which most dvertisements make products seem much better than they are .

First , the visual somehow will attract people 's attention to the product .
This is the first purpose of the selling products , becaus people attracte by the fancy advertusements , which pull people'sattention on the products will makes people believe in it .
Thus it makes a succeseful impact to win the bttle betwn consumers and the advertusers .
To increase the desire of consumer to buy the products is the first rule for the advertisement .
Therefore , the advertisements must be attractive , which means it should looks better thand they really are .

Secondly , if the first movment succed it will bring lots of benifits to the company , for seeling the products as much as they can will help the company 's reputation increased and develoed credit for itself .
Moreover , it will make the company 's economy sitution grow very significntly , which help them to earn aa lot of money .
Therefore , the advertisements usually make products seem much better than they really are .
Pieces of idea for pieces of benifit , but benifit as a snowball as it is rolling through the snow filed will grow bigger and bigger .
Thus , the avertise put their heart in the advertisements to seek for the enumorus benifit .

In short , the advertisments make proucts seem much better that they really are .
Indeed for the visual attraction and the economic benifits , advertisment will keep improve .
