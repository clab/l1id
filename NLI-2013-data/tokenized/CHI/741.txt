Considering the fast development of our society , people are now eagering to gain more and more knowledge of many diferrent academic areas to survive in the more and more intense competetion in different conditions such as going to college or being in a beneficial position in the job market .

A strong argument for these phenomenance is that we could promote our interpersonal ability by learning a lot of different accademic subjects .
By doing so , you are able to know the conditions in many areas so as to master the task of your work in the whole and make right decision .
It leads you to success .

Further more , possessing a broad knowledge in different areas could make you cultivate new interest in different fiels and give you more perspectives to look at your surrounding world .
It brings you a great body of fun and makes your life meaningful .

I also have a personal reason for learning a lot of knowledge .
I am a man with a strong desire for achievement and always want to possess more knowledge about the world which would challenge myslfe and make me a useful people needed by my society. a wide knoledge in lots of aspects enable me to seek success in more areas rather that a narrow one .
I can combine them together to make me more wiser so that I could directly contribute to the society .
As to me , feel needed is my final happiness of my life and a broad knowledge make me realize it .

Meanwhile , to specialize in one specific subject also has its merits .
You could concerntrat on one fiel you like and have a high academic achievement .
However , you may be not able to jump from your small `` circle '' without a wide knoledge .

Due to what has been talked above , it is more safer to say that : broading your knowledge makes you more sccessful than you would if you do n't .
