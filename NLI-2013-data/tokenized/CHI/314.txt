I totally agree with the statment that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In my opinion , as time goes by , the world is improving , and so do ourselves .
We need to improve ourselves everyday to be successful .
I believe that trying new thing and take tisks is the best way to improve ourselves .
As the environment is moving on , we meet new things .
Since we are not familiar with it , we should spent time to find out what it 's all about .
In that case , risks is unavoidable because we do n't know what 's going to happen .
In the progress , we can find out and learn a lot of precious knowledge that we never knew .
In that case , we 're improving .

In the progress , we may face a great difficulty , which is very hard to solve .
When we managed to solve the problem , we gain experiences .
In this way , we make the new things into the things that we already know .
So we can learn more things if we try new things .

For the more , I believe that trying new things can make us more intellegent .
We face different things so that we think about different things .
Our brain can recieve a better practice .
As a result we can be more intellegent .

On the contrary , if we do n't try new things and take risks , the only thing we could do is to repeat doing the same thing that we already know .
That would have a bad effect on ourselves .
When more and more new things arrive , we still know nothing about them .
So we would no longer be competitive .
In other word , we would not be successful .

As trying new things can improve ourselves , make us learn more about the world , let us be more intellegent , I believe that trying new things and take risks is more likely to make successful people .
