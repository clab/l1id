The question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts .
In my opinion , understanding is definatly more important because it give the students a progress of exploring , a chance to be creative and an unforgetable result .

Trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topics alows students to go through the investing process .
For example , telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor , similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing .
Instead , it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literture and found out themselves that certain techniques add to the porfessioness of writing .
Understand how they work would give students a better lesson .

Getting the concepts and ideas also provides students a chance to be creative , especially when dealing with are .
What kind of art class whould it be without studio work ?
Students should be offered to get creative with colours , textures , moods and all sorts of thing .
Who cares if they fail once in a while ?
New creations found in the process of real understanding .

Years after years , it is not the defination that students remember , but the unforgetable experience that they learned .
Giving out the facts does not provide students a lot of thoughs of their own .
By understanding the ideas and concepts , students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves .
Even if they forget about the facts , they would be able to `` reproduce '' them .

Facts is the devil that limited imagination and understanding .
Thomas Edison woulding be able to invest without knowing the ideas and concepts of science very well .
