As a matter of fact , the issue of whether successful people try new things and take risker rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a complex ahd controversial topic .
Different people hold different views due to their distinct backgrounds and experience .
But for my perspective , I think the people attend to success is not only due to their trying new things and taking risks but also some other insistant .
However , it 's a key to succeed .
If I must to choose one , I will coose the fomer statement .
In the following discussion , I would like to give some evidences to support my point of view and give other examples the refute cursory opinion .

First of all , the arguement can be presented to develop my position is that successful people need different idea of invention to bulid new things .
Why I say that ?
According to the current rich man , about two third of them earn their fame from the new technological products .
A good example may be found in the case that the most weathy person is rich based on his courage to take risk for investing new technology .
Under this circumstance , it is quite obvious that the curious enterprise is nescessary for successful poople .

In addition , there is another reason for me to choose the former statement .
The reason is not far to seek that speed of investing is more improtant thing than past .
For the realistic example , our families decided to sell cookies near our home , but there had another cookie shop to open earlier than us .
Losing the advantage of the opening time , we were failed to invest the shop and lost money .

Consequently , considering the strong reasons and examples that successful people need the ambition to try new things , which sometimes intertwine a organic whole and become more persuasive , we may safely arrive at the conclusion that I supprot the former statement .
