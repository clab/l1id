We all know that young people are more energetic and more healther than older people .
I can feel that in my life experience , my mother stay at home every weekend , I ask her why she do n't go outside , she always give me the answer such as `` No ...
I feel tired `` or '' No ...
i 'm not interesting about outside stuff '' .
Beacuse of these reason I believe that young people can enjoy life and do more activities than older people do .

On of the reason is that older people get tired easily , they may even have some problem with their body system .
In such case , they can not go mountain climbing , go disco with friends , go shopping for 5 hours long .
They ca n't bear these carzy activities , therefore they will miss some chances to know more about vivd life , And the other reason is that young people , like me , we usually go for a trip with our friends in the spring break or summer vacation , we see or gain more information by this activity , we know more cultures from other country and people , that is older people prabebily ca n't do .

I believe many parents , includ my parent told to their children , participate in more activities and enjoy life when we are still young , because after graduate from university we have to concentrate on our career , try do be a succesful people in the society .
After age 30 , we focus more on our family ( especially women ) , after 40 we do ore best to earn money yo support family , after 50 we have no energy at all to enjoy our life .
