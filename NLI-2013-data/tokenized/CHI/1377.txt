Views differs greatly when it comes to the discussion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .
On the one hand , some asserts that having a wide range of knowledge is better .
While others thinks that it is better to specialize in one subject .
However , I think it is better to have a broad range of knowledge .

Take engineers for example , They are very knowledgable when it comes to computer related problems .
But they are so isolated in their computer field that when it comes to other subjects they have no clue .
My friend John is the perfect example for such discussion .
He is an excellent student in the engineering field .
He can answer any question you might have regarding computers .
However , when we are talking about other subjects , such as , art history , he can not join our conversation at all .

Another problem with focusing on just one single subject is that you will not know what else is out there .
You might be interested in world history , but because you are specialized in one subject .
You have to spend all your time studying that subject and have no time to study world history .
One of these days , when you look back .
That might be the one thing that you regret the most .

Nevertheless , specialize in one subject have its advantages .
You will have a very clear and deep understanding of that subject .
But when we compare the advantage and disadvantage of specializing in one specific subject or not , the most obvious selection is to have a broad knowledge of various of academic subjects .

With the points noted in the discussion , I agree with the statement .
I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
