Nowadas , advertisemnts become a very hot topics that everyone want to discuss it .
Some people thinks that advertisements are quite good ; however , others think that most advertisements make products seem much beetter than they really are .
From my point of view , I agree with the second opinion .

First of all , the purpose of the advertisements lead the businessman to lie to audience .
There are a lot of same products in the maket .
Every businessman want to sale their own products and make money .
Why people buy their products ?
They can persude consumer to buy their products by making the advertisements .
However , if they do not describe the products much better than they really are , consumers will not buy this products , so thay the businessman will not sale the products and make the money .

Secondly , the famous people like to make money by telling the lie to audiences .
People are always very curiostiy .
They want to know more about the live of sport stars , singing stars , moive stars .
One way to know the famous people better is to buy the products which they introduce by the advertisement .
The producer know that people always believe what the famous people say .
For example , a famous movie star in Hong Kong tell the audiences that use this mask wil let you look like 10 years younger in a mask advertisement .
After watching this advertisement in the TV , a lot of women go to the shop to buy this mask .
Alll wise audience notices what the movie star says will not come true .
There are still many people believe this advertisement .
Three months latere , a news report that this mask is very harmful to woman and it will be banned to sale .

In conclusion , it is true that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
In order to be a wise consumer , you need to know what is real and you can not believe everything the famous people says .
