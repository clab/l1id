As far as I am concerned , I agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Nowadays young people would like to attentd other activities and seldomly think about that they help the communities .
I will account for my reasons as follows .

First of all , young people have so many activities that they would not to consider to help the communities .
On the leisure time , they will make plans to go out with friends or spend time on computer .
Hence , because they have too many activities to choose , they mabe have a little chance to take the communities into account .

Secondly , nowadays we are not so familiar with the people who resident in the same community .
Therefore , if yound people are asked to help community , they may be doubtful that why they should help the community or the people who they do n't acquaint .
Because of lacking the cohision and the concept that we like family in the same community , yound people wo n't spend time on helping their communities .

Finally , in the educational system , parents and teachers may teach young people to attend the activities in the communities .
However , the concept does not achieve through doing it physicially .
The concept is just like a sign which is taught by parents and teachers .
Furthermore , nowadays parents are so busy that they wo n't encourge their children to help the communities .

In conclusion , there are many solid evidences to proof that young people do n't spend enough time to help their communities .
Hence , I agree the statement .
