There are three reasons presented as followed .

To begin with , we need to have a broad knowledge before we enter the job market .
This society now are very competitive , and we do not want to fall behind others .
Studying many academic subjects offers us to have more possibilities .
Thus , the more we learn , the more oppotinutes we have .

In addition , learning a wide range of different knowledge will fulfill our daily lives .
If we only focus on one subject , we might become a professor in the field .
But there are many things that we can not learned from only one subject , we will not have the ability to deal with those things .

What is more , we can find something we would like to do by picking up many subjects .
From learing different subjects , we can find new things in different subjects .
For example , we can find what we are good at and after we graduated from school we can find a relative job .

To sum up , I strongly agree that we should learn many academic subjects for several reasons , among them giving more competitive stutus , filling up our lives , and finding strange
