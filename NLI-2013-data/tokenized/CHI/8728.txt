`` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts . ''
I am strongly agree that ideas and concept is much more important than just learn or remember the facts as it is .
Although we are surrounded by milliones of billiones of facts , but as a student , I believe that somehow tell them how to fish is better than just give them fishes .

Undeniable , we have to learn some basic facts in order to do some further explanation or elaboration .
Ultimately , we go through that much of studies basically is to archieve something .
If ours goals were just to learn something , learning facts will be much more easier and effective .
But we are not only learning , absorbing , and memorizing ; we are also improving , creating and inventing .

For instance , if we just tell a student that Sun provides heat and light .
He will just tell you as it is .
In other hands , if we told the student the ideas and concepts of Sun providing heat and light .
Perhaps here comes different , since the student understand well , he have much more space for him to create or imagine .
Imagination brings creation .
By simply memorizing or learning facts will not prevent the student from further thinking .
Hence understanding is better than learning .

Follwing is understanding will give the student better imprint than just by hard learning .
People say , '' Learn by heart not learn by only head '' or '' Study smart not study hard '' .
These shows that better concept on a subject will create a newline in study .
Students will never allowed to say , `` Sorry , I forgot '' .
This is because they are not memorizing hard or just `` swolled '' as it is .
Things that they learned is learn by examples , ideas , and concept .
The will simply recall the facts by seeing the examples or relate this to that by ultimately knowing the basic ideas .

We are moving to a new world , a whole new era .
Students are those who support the coming future .
They should neither study with only old fashion style nor just forget about tradition .
Instead of that , they should study in a fusion , a combination way of study .
