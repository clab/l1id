Advertisement is a form of media that is common and effective in promoting and advertising a product .
Although advertisement gives information on the product , it often exaggerate the product 's pros and functions and and mislead people into buying the product .
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In order to impress viewers of the advertisements , the product being advertised is usually altered and enchanced by computer softwares si that it looks more attactive thus increasing the probability that the product would be sold .

One example to show that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are is the promotion of the macbook pro computer .
The advertisements stated all sorts of advantages functions of the computer , virtually praising the computer as a state of the art product of the century .
But once you bought the actual product you would find out the statements and descriptions on the advertisements are actually misleading and might be false .
the advertisements stated the battery life and speed of the computer but it was only ture under certain conditions which is never mentions in the advertisement .
Another fact is that the computer looks amazing in the advertisement but it looks different when the product is shipped to your house .

In conclusion , the texts and appearence of a product that appear on the advertisment is designed with purpose and intention to a more attractive and dramatic looking but it is usually better than how the product actually are .
