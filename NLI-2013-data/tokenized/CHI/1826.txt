The way that the young and the old living their lives are totally different nowadays in China .
And what I agree is young people do enjoy life mor than older people do .

Maybe the most important reason is that young people spend more money .
Almost every young students have some technological instrument , such as CD player , digital camera , mobile phone , MP3 player , or even MP4 player .
But that 's not so popular in adults .
They may only have a very old type mobile phone .
The computers in everyhome have almost become toys for the children , the only function is to play game .
Compared to my classmates , I 'm a saving boy , but compared to my parents , I 'm wasting .
Once , when I was having lunch at a out-door restraunt near my schol , many adults passed me by .
What they do is just leave , because they think it was too expensive .

Another unforgettable reason may be the different style of education we get .
Our parents were told to save when they were at school .
Save , save , save .
All they knew was to save , and they really met some problem , which `` save '' really helped them .
But what I learn is `` Enjoy your life ! '' , so I do .
I enjoy my life so much that what I have enjoyed maybe more than my parents .

Also , love is a factor , maybe someone will ignore .
Adults have many people for them to love .
Their husbands or wives , children , parents .
But for we , we only love ourselves .
We have n't got so many people to love , and we are still do n't know how to love , and who to love .
So the olders want the people they love to enjoy their lives , not themselves , which is completely different from us .

Last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca n't enjoy , such as some physical sports , such as football , basketball and some dangerous stuff .

So , in my point of view , the youth enjoy lives more than their elders do .
