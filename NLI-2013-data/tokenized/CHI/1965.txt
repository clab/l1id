Nowadays , it is not a rare for us to read and hear that some young people , even at such an early age , say 15 , are able to gain their reputation as a champion in sports events , or make great success in acadamical field .
Also , there are some adults critisize that adolencents do noting but merely enjoy the modern luxary life .
Personally , I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do , since the era we are living in has greatly advanced .

First , because of the progress of the society , there are more aboundant resorces than in the past .
In other words , young people are able to take good advantage of all the conditions that the society offers to them .
For example , a 16-year-old boy would go to the bar , for almost everyday , to enjoy a cup of beer which cost him 20 dollars .
While other students would regard the experience of driving an expensive car as their every day `` homework '' .
Yet all these are imaginable in their parents ' era .
It is all because that we are living in a affluent society .

Second , the society advances not only in its material , but also people ' s spiritual status , that is , adolencents tend to hold different beliefs with the elder gerneration .
While parents , who mainly live in the 1970s , regard hard work as a viture , their kids would despise at such an idea .
What they want is to buy a new-style ADIDAS sneakers , simply to follow their idles in the advertisement .
We do not reject the possibility there are still a small proportion of adolencents as dillegent as their parents , but the fact that more and more people choose enjoying life as their belief is not denniable .

Third , the financial independence is another factor contributing to young people 's enjoying-life belife .
If it were not for the ability that young people make mony themselves , they could not have gone so further in purchasing expensive products .
Modern society provides more opportunity for young peopel to work , with the money they earn always go with them to the shopping center .
