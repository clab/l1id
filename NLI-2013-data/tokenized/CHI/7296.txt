When we have an intention to go travelling , we will very often look for travel agencies where the staff there can prvide us with the necessary information .
Another advantage is that if the travel agencies will provide us with a tour guide during our journeys .
The tour guides are able to tell us the history of the place and the informtion about the scenic spots .
However , I believe that the best way to travel is not travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but travelling individually .
There are several advantages .

Firstly , we will seek for information about different places ourselves .
Through the researh work , we have a better knowledge about the places and this will enrich our knowledge .
After that , we can make rational decisions based on our own will .
On the other hand , if we consult travel agencies , we will be greatly influenced by their opinions and this will hinder our decision-making .
Since the travel agencies are profit-making organizations and their common objective is profit maximization , they may not really provide good advice for us .

Secondly , we can choose the destination according to our own will .
For instance , if we enjoy watching natural sceneries , we will look for a place where there are abundance of beautiful and fatastic sceneries .
However , if we are led by a tour guide , we cannot go to everywhere we want because we have to follow the planned schedules which are designed for all the customers and are not particularly designed for us .
Travelling individually can enable us to schedule our own time during the trips .

Thirdly , since we have made research before the trips , we can go to the places we want and to explore the places .
We will get great satisfaction if we find something interesting there becaue it is discovered by ourselves .
Thus , this will create eternal memories in our minds .
If we are led by tour guides , we may be bound to stay at an uniteresting place for a long time .
Consequetly , we will lose the real meaning of travelling , that is , relaxation and entertainment .
