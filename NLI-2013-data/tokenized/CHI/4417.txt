I totally agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because the main purpose of advertisements is to sell the products , of course they need to show the advantages of the products to attrack consumers and hide the disadvantages to avoid unnecessary damage to the products ' images .

Advertisement , as we know , is a kind of promotion .
Companies use advertisements to introduce their products to the public and want the public like their products .
However , not all products are perfect ; therefore , they will try to just show the good part of the product in the advertisement .
In fact , consumers will have high expectation of the products they saw in the advertisement .
Sometimes , the higher you expectation is , the bigger disappointment you will get .
That 's why people often think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Furthermore , advertisements will not show the disadvantages of the products to you .
You only can learn how the product actually works or whether you really like the product or not through your own experience .
For examle , I saw the advertisement of Tacobell 's new product on TV last month .
It seemed so delicious and had plenty of ingredients in it .
I could n't help thinking about the picture of that product all the time .
Finally , one day , I bought the product .
I was so disappointed when I first saw the product in real .
It was so tiny and almost had nothing inside .
And of course , it was not so delicious as I imagined before .

To sum up , advertisements are made to sell their products and they always only show the advantages of products and skip the disadvantages .
