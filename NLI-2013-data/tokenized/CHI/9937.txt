I do agree that people who try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well have more opportunities become successful .
First of all , to try new things and take risk means you have more opportunities to success in another area .
You step in in these areas where you are not familiar with and have a higher risk which keeps most of people away from it , there are more chance for you to success .

Second , to try new things and take risk , you should learn more knowledge and be more cautious to do things .
You will learn from experts and from the books .
You will focals all your energy to this things , that means you have great base to access success .

Third , You will open your mind , use different ways to reach your aim .
eventurelly , you wil find the proper way to your destination after you try so many different ways .
For example , you decide to learn to play tennis today .
you also get a chance to success in tennis player in the same day .
In the following days , you will try to get information about how to play this game , from books , internet , even you plan going to an experts near you to ask advices .
There is another chance for you to get success , because you get more and more knowledge and contact more and more people .
You will arrange you time to pactise .
In the practice , you will concentrate yourself becasue you know nothing about what you are doing .
So , you will try your best to do it perfectly .
That means you train yourself in concentration .
