I strongly agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The society rapidly changes , facts will be someday outdated and not important when other facts show up .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is the best method to help student think abstractly and creatively .
For example , in the car show , people would like to preform their ideal concept cars to give new insights to companies and customers the trend of the society flow .
No matter the reliability and feature of the car , people have to think critically how the next step will be .
If people just follow the stopped fact , people would not have new ideas to create and the society will not easily grow .
Fact is just let people know that people need to be aware without making the same mistakes and errors .

In childhood , students have to learn art , math , music , and science subjects to help students increase insights and be abstract .
Understanding ideas and concepts can be used permanently , but facts is not .
In some conditions , facts is more important when students make mistakes .
Teacher gives either reinforcement and punishment to stop students ' behavior and help them create thoughts .
In the fast-paced society , people everyday is struggling the meaning of life .
For instances , money , realionship , culture , and safety are all meanful in human beings .
This is a fixed fact .
However , anything that gives meaning to human beings before fact would be ideas and concepts .
Students will not know what love and money means until the day they learn and experience , and then one day become their own fact .
As a result , in the twentieth century , to go a step further , people have to understand ideas and concepts and ignore the previous fact in oder to create new insights to contribute the modern society
