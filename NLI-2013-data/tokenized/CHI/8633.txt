Since students start learning thing in the schools , they have the responsbeality to learn everything they should know ; therefore , students are suppose to understand ideas and concepts more than just knowing the facy .
There are some reasons why I think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the fact .

First of all , students that understanding ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interesting in that subject .
For example , once studnets understand the ideas of how math work , they can do the math easier and faster than others who do n't understand the idea .
Also , if students knows what the concept is in a history event , they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it .
They can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is .

Secondly , I do n't believe students would learn well if they just learn the facts .
For instance , many subjects like history , geoeraphey and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts .
If students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to good marks on the subjects .
Further more , if students do not learn the subjexts well , they can easily fail the courses and lost their interests to them either in the history , math , science , and even English calsses .

Based on the two reasons that I mentioned above , I suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does lot more important than only know the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects .
