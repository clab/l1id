I completely agree with the statement from my personal experiences and from my observations .
The good thing about traveling in a group is that it 's easier for travelers .
Because the traveling plan is already well arranged by the tour guide , so the travelers do n't have to spend lots of time making the plan .
The only thing that need is to follow the tour guide and have fun .
Also , since they do n't need to worry about the schedule , they can completely relax and enjoy the tour .
Moreover , to travel in a group is safer because the gangs wo n't easily conduct crime to the person who are in a group .
There is one more benifit for traveling in a group , that is , the price is often lower due to the special discount for group people .
Beside , the tour guide is more professional than us , therefore the travelers can get to know many histories and bakcgrounds of the scene .

Fot example , from my observations , the honey moon would be the best if traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
Because the couple can really enjoy the trip without fighting with each other in where to go or which place to go first .
As a results , the new marriage couple can maintain good relationship all along the honey moon .

On the other hand , when traveling alone , travelers are taking the risks .
First , since they might not be familiar with the place they 're going to , the plan they made would probably expose themself into the unknown danger .
Second , they need to worry about their schedule all the time .
That would give them the pressure when traveling and make them become nervous .
Third , as compare to the group , the price of traveling alone is often higher .

In sum , I agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
