Advertisement , as a typical factor of this commercial society , can keep working because of it can make things better than they really are , so people will decide to buy the products .
In my opinion , Changing covers , announcing a new verison , and using famous super stars are three ways for advertisements to make them look much better than they real are .

The covers make them look unique , professional , and beautiful .
But what will happen if people get used to it ?
The fancy cover wo n't attract people anymore .
So at this time , they will chance their covers .
For an example , Coca cola , as a very popular and traditonal soft drink of America , has changed its cover for so many times , but it did n't really change the drink itself .
The new covers will let people think , maybe it might taste better .
The new covers bring people a new mood , which is invisible .

A new version is another way of advertisements .
When people get used to use something , they will lost their interests .
So a new version of the product will coming out at this time .
It does n't mean the product is still the old thing , but no one knows exactly how much the productor changed it .
For example , there are so many kinds of shampoo say they are the second verison , but only professional analytists would know how much they really changed , and how much different will be made .

The third way for the productors to sell more their products is to use make the famous guys , such as singers , movie stars , or even the president .
The effects of the famous people are huge .
First , if someone is a fan of a movie star .
He or she might buy the product without any reasons .
Second , most super stars have good-looking faces .
Even the product is not the reason that made them look good , cosumers might be affected .
So they think at least they might become beautiful .

So in conclusion .
The most advertisements use verision , cover and super stars to confuse people .
So they can use these ways to hide the real value of their products , and sell more of them .
