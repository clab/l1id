Life was a box of chocolate , you 'll never know what you are going to get .
Yes , I start my essay with this famous sentance .
I always consider life is a period of unexpecting experience .
No matter we like the situation you 're in or not , we should accept it ; no matter we were young or old , we could not escape any of those experience .
My point of view is that we could enjoy it , with a grateful heart , seriously and hopefully .

When I was young , I begun to learn dance when I was four .
I should practice everyday after class .
I not only received numorous awards in dancing competition , but also gain much more joyful compared to my peers .
I have a vivid childhood .
When I grow up gradually , I still like my life full of colorful experience .
I never give up attampt different kinds of things , either for entertainment or for serious academic subjects .
My interdicipline research includes economics , journalism and political science , much more broader and deeper than others .
I 'm content with my life pattern , I believe I enjoy my life more than the generation older than me , such as my parents .

My parents was almost fifty years old now .
I was always believing that they were busy working everyday , all of theire concern is earning our family a much better life , competing with others , and so on .
But things change when I begun to oberserve them more carefully , I begun to doubte myself , does young people really enjoy life more than older people do ?

I found although they are becoming older and older everyday , and they still have their own work to do now , they go to park every evening after dinner , contiuning for twenty years .
You could not imagine how beautiful that picture are --- at that very moment when they are walking together , talking and smiling , it is the happiness .

Yes , walking together in the park , for several years .
It 's quite simple , but i believe for them , it 's the joy of life .
As I stated previously , no matter we were young or old , enjoy life with a grateful heart is my own choice .
All of us could enjoy life well .
