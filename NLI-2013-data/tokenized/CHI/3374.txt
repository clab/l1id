Some people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Others may have negative points of view .
In my opinion , I argues that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays .
There are some reasons to support my opinion .
I will mention them as follows .

To begin with , as technology developed , young people do not care about other things except for the computer .
They spend most of their time to surfing the internet , playing computer games , and chatting on line .
For example , they like to make friends on the internet and use msn messenger to `` talk '' with each other , instead of useing the telephone .
They are so intrigued in playing games online that they do not want to spend time getting along with their family .

In addition , young people are protected well by their parents .
Hence , they do not need to work hard to earn lots of money .
They fool around all day long without being asked to make money for living .
Whenever they needs money , all they have to do is to open their mouth and say `` Mom , I want some money . ''
Consequently , they do not care about doing something meanful to their communties .

The third reason that I think young people do not give time to helping is that the environment do not give them the opportunity .
For instance , young people have a comfortable and convenient environment to live .
They are carefree and happy all the time , not worrying about other things .
There are no difficuties for the young people to solve .
Therefore , they do n't have the idea to help others and even their communities .

Taking into account the reasons I listed above , I consent to the statement that young poeple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
