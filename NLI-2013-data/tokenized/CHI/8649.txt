I disagree with this statement for two reasons .
At first , it would be quite difficult for students to understand ideas or concepts , if they do not learn facts of them , or even let the students a misunderstand , to learn facts is not necessary .
When a history teacher in high school teach students about a compared between industry socialty and agriculture socialty .
Both of the defnitions are easy to remmeber , but how to understand the difference ?
Acturlly students have kown the facts of industry by their living , even before the teacher explains the facts .
They know that industry has producted our model lifes , from telephone to internet , from cars to jets .
To try to understand , what does mean agricalture ?
Just let us live without all the facts of industry .

However , to understand ideas and concepts is not the full task for students , and not even the goals to study from the beginning .
As adults , we know it now , the right way to handle the knowledge is to use it .
Teachers should let the students know , good memorry about ideas and concepts is just helpful in some exams , but not in working and living .
In china we have many negative examples , because schools were only concerntreting on teaching about exams in last 20 years .
A famous emploryer complained that he did not dare to hire the people who achieved doctor degree in china .
Because they knew the concepts very well , but failed to use them in practical , and they did not know a good communication is the key in a team to use the concepts in facts .

As I went to Germany and began my college study in Stuttgart .
I knew in first time , most of things I had learned till my high school have only one goal , that is to use them in fact .
I began a lot of courses to learn facts there , from communication to techique .
That is the key .
