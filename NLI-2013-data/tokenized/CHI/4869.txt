Yes , this right .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because most products think they are better than the other .
Like two people play a game , some times , the loser will think the winner does n't better than him , just because he was lack .
Even the winner win the game so easy , the loser think the winner just same leavel to himself .
So they always think themself is better , so they would n't listen to any body .
They think they are always ture , becaues they are better than the other .
