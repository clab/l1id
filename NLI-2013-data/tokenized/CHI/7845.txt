It can not be denied that travel may bring lots of fun and pleasure to the people who travel .
However , concerning which is a better way to travel , by self or in a group led by a tour guide or some ways else , it is still not reached a same point .
Personally , I quite agree that travel in a group is the best way .
In the following , I 'd like to provide my specific reasons to support the attitute .

Obviously , I think travelling in group can reduce the troubles during the turism .
Generally , the place we are going to travle may be a brand new location which we have never been to and know less before the travel , therefore , lots of practical problem such as accomadation , transportation and so on will be encounted , Led by a tuor guide who may help us to reduce the time wasted on those poblems .

Moreover , if the travel is in a group led by a tour guide , more information concerning the place visiting may be provided .
As we can imagine that the responsblity of a tour guide is to provide the background knowledege of the place visiting .
With such a person , a lot of information of the place such as the history and culture which should be recorded and abstracted respectively may missing during the visit .
That does not sound to be a lot of fun .

The third and also the last , large amount of travel fee may also be save .
Generally speaking , a tour guide .
are those who have been to the visiting place more time than us , which enable he or she provide a well-organinzed scheldule .
Therefore , a lot of money which is not necessarily spent may be saved .

To sum up , in my mind , I consider travelling in a group as the best way and best choice for me , which is more joyful and gainful .
