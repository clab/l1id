I have traveled many places throughout my life .
I love to travel with my parents , but of course , there were many times that we traveled in a group led by a tour guide .
I personally prefer to travel without a group and definately to travel without a tour guide .

The first summer vacation that my parents and I went to Japan , I was only six years old .
We were with a group of people , and there was a tour guide .
Every historical place or any amusement park we went , we traveled with a big tour bus .
The tour guide would then explained details for information that tourists should know .
Though it seemed to be useful , I felt most of the time I was `` trapped , '' and `` bored . ''
And I wanted to see this very phenomenal temple on our way to the hotel , but I was told not to do so because we were on the group ; it was not on the schedule .
I felt it was such a disappointment .
In addition , I could not have stay in a place where I wanted to stay longer ; daily schedule was already written for us , and the place we went might not be the one I was interested in .

I have travled to Hong Kong , United States , Korea , and Japan alone or with my parents .
It was such a big difference compare to if I was with a group .
I could do everything I wanted .
I was free to stop by a comestic shop whenever I felt like it .
My time was flexible .
It was the best when I acutally went to Korea and stayed with my friends ' houses .
They brought me to places that I do n't think I would go if I was with a group .
For instance , my friend 's grandparents garden and places where famous band concerts performed .
It was incredibly entertaining and that is why I am passionate about traveling without a group led by a tour guide .

Though there are reasons I partly liked to travel in a group led by a tour guide , I do not think that is the best way to travel .
I am more comfortable either traveling alone or with my parents because it not only benefits the relationship between me and my family , I also see the world larger in this point of view .
