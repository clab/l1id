More and more young people today are often considered as the kind of people who always think about themselves not someone else .
They always think they are busy doing some very important things , so they do n't need to think about spending their free time to helping their communities , even though many experts inspire young people to do so and mention many times about that they can learn many things from the activity .
So according to the writing question , my answer is that I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
I have two reasons to support my idea .

Firstly , young people today are too selfish to consider other people 's feeling and see other people 's needs .
It is just like what I mentioned before .
They always think they are so special people in their mind that they may think other people need to give them some services for sure .
To cuase the result may be that most parents today spoil or treat their children too much well , and forget to remind them the old saying : giving is better than taking .
So it is esay to understand why young people do n't want to spend enough time for their community .

The another reason is that our educational system too much emphasize that if students have a good grade in studying and then they will have more opportunities to have a successful future that is waiting for them .
So now young students have a `` good '' excuse to decline the activity about spending time to help their community .

In fact , it is not a good situation for young people 's growth , so governments and parents need to think about the issue more serious .
