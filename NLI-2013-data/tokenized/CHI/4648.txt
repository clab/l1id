I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This seems to make sensens to comercial , because they try to persueing better profit from doing it , I am going to make some points to analize it .

First , the better advertisements can deliver a good perspection to consumer , make them believe that this is the right product for them , and to have this item will benifit either thire everyday life or promote thire health , for the company knows that people seeking better by nature .

Additionally , by over describe the item , make the custumer can not resist the merits of the product , in turn they can sell thire item high in quantities and can make more profir from it .

Forethemore , in ths way the company may raise thire reputation by telling people that they are the best one who can provide the public the best thing which are the one that the customer need , and once the company suceessfully gain the reputation , it is more easy for them to do the comercial in the future , for examlpe , the Ford automabile company is not recognized by consumer , by doing advertisement , to introduce thire car charastistic which are very functional which meet the need that people expected , such as the entertainment founction , the power of the engine , as thire statment been recognized by public , they reach thire goal : to make profit .

All in all , I would say that the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are are understandable , the question is that how the consumer to distiguish the real quality with what the information they get from the comany , the consumer need make desision that what stuff is they really need .
