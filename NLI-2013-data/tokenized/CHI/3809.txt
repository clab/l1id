I strongly agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .
Being a volunteer myself at the National University Hospital for more than three years , I have sensed that the communities does need a lot of help from the general public .
However , the young people involved in this project are extremely few .
There are numerous reasons for this phenomenon .

The first reason would be a lack of interest .
We face a great difficulty to recruit people every year .
They are simply attracted to other booths that are considered more interesting , such as Outdoor Activities Club , Dance Society and Rock Climbing Club .
These activities involve a lot of physical movement and help them to bond better with their friends .
They have a golden chance to know more about people from their age and build firmer friendship via such activities .
Helping the communities , on the other hand , usually requires the interaction with people outside the school .
Most of the time , they are from another age group .
It is very difficult to get the young people interested or excited to talk with the elderly patients for two hours straight or to play with kids who hardly know any ` hot ' music or movies .
Young people believe that they could hardly gain anything out of helping the communities .
As a result , most of them are not interested .
This also explains why Ministry of Education in Singapore sets compulsory hours of community service for the Junior College students .
If not , young people would not set time aside for such activities .

Secondly , time contraint usually hinders the young people to helping their communities .
Young people nowadays are preoccupied with simply too many activities , such as school work , co-curriculum activities and other entertainment programs .
In Singapore universities , we have to attend lectures , laboratories , tutorials and seminars for almost 30 hours a week .
During our spare time , we have numerous project meetings , assignments , essays and tests to prepare and study for .
In our mere free time , we tend to relax by chatting on MSN , surfing the Internet , playing computer games , watching movies or joining club activities such as bridge club , skating club , outdoor activities club etc .
This simply leaves us little time to help the communities .

Thirdly , young people , especially people from rich families , are not mature enough to face the reality in the communities .
Grown up in a wealthy family who live in condominiums or private houses , young people do not see the other side of the society .
They do not recognize the existence of people who work 14 hours a day and earn a meager income , who live on public pensions of 200 dollars a month ( equivalent for the cost of their newly bought Nike shoes ) , who live in a house without electricity and gas supply , who are sick but have no money to see a doctor and who are too weak to see the sun-rise on the next morning .
Helping their communities provides too cruel a reality for them to accept .
As a result , they opt to escape from facing them completely .

In conclusion , it is my stand that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This may be due to their lack of interest , time constraints or their intention to escape from the cruel reality .
