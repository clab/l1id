The present generation of young people grew up in an increasing affluent world .
Because of this , many people have the impression that young people nowadays are spoiled and selfish .
However , I think this is an unfaired opinion .
Amittedly , there are spoiled breds among young people , but most of them are willing , and even eager , to spending time to help their communities .

Firstly , the vibrancy of local and international community-involvment programs ( CIPs ) proves that young people nowadays are willing to help their communities .
For example , in many schools , the response for short-term or even long-term CIPs is often so overwhelming that selection proess is necessary .
Also , many students are willing to get out of their comfort zone to help out in villages where living conditions are extremely poor .
This shows their willingness to spend their time to help more .

Secondly , many students are commited to various programs over a very long period of time .
For example , some students in Singpore continue to be a member of the Interact Club from secondary school to junior college , over six years .
They typically take part in different programs , for example , giving out tuitions or helping our at an old folks ' home , twice a week .
Again , these students show that young people are willing to sacrifice a large amout of time for their communities .

Thirdly , many young people have the intention to be social workers , or at least volunteers .
Those who have participated in CIPs or other volunteery work find such activities enrich their experiences .
While they help the weak groups in their communities , they gain satsifaction of helping others .
As a result , they want to do more and even condier social worker as a career choice .
A social worker at her twenties I know had the aspiration of being a social worker after she started in a program for ophans .
She felt strongly to commit more time after graduating from university .
Thus , young people do give time to help their communities .

In conclusion , the young are not as selfish as many people think .
As they benefit from society , they want to give back , too .
They have the passion to help their communities and are willing to commit themselves for community-involvement programs .
