I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
First , with the pressure increasing , some students focus on their studies most of the time .
For example , in our country , we have to get up around 6 o'clock and go to school at 7 .
And most of us will go to cram school after school .
The time that we arrive home is around 10p.m.We also have a lot of work to do at home .
So we do n't have enough time for sleeping , needless to say helping our community .

Besides , most of young people now are more care about themselves .
They work part-time jobs very hard to earn money to make themselves prettier or buy more things they like .
They even do n't care about their parents .
What their communities become is not a big deal .
It is common to see that someone calling help on the street but no one gives a hand .

Also , most young people just know how to play computer games or watch TV .
They do n't know how to clean their bedroom , pick up trashes on the street or take care of others .
If they have free time , they will plan to hang out with their friends instead of helping their communities .
However , they do n't know that by helpning communities can make them learn more .
Communities are just like a small scociety .
Helping each others , especially in your neighborhood , can earn a lot of precious experiences that may use in the future .

There is no doubt that teenagers do n't give enough time to help their communities .
This may become a serious problem that need more concerns of our scociety .
