Depending on personal experience , personality type and emotional concern , we find that some people hold the idea on have broad knowledge of many acacdemic subjects meanwhile others perfor to have specialize in one specific subject .
In my point of view , it is more advisable to choose have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than have specialize in one specific subject , My argument of this piont are lited as follows .

The main reason for prepencity for have broad knowledge of many academic subfects is that , i will know more and more knwolege , for instance i am actress , if i lear more show kind , i will have the chance more than others .

Another reason that can been see by everyone is that every thing is same , have a commen thing , know more things , can help people develp .
For example , dance , a tap dance , who must learn ballet , jazz and others kind dance can help they improve the tap dance In my argument of my point is also in a possition of advantage for a because nowadys , the job can find not easy , so we must leran more and know more , can accdept the social nowadys .

I agree that there may be have a caple of advantage of have specialize in one speciffic subject , however it is more disadvantage abviouse of have specialize in one specific subuect such as also tap dancer , if they just learn tap dance , they must not better than the person who can more kind dance .

In a word we must learn more and more in oder to accdept the sicial nowadys .
So , it is vagacinal to support have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in the statment that it is better to choose have broad knowledge of many academic subfects .

That is
