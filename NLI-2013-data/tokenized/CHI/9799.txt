New things will never stop coming to people 's life .
Some people belive that during their lifetime must try all the new things or you will be cut off the line .
Others belived trying to do a new thing is just wasting time .
I however belived that do not kit new things out your door .
Because , using a new thing can help people learn more stuff , can catch the line of world 's change , having fun by working in new things .
When people already knows how to do some thing well , no one will want to use extra time to study another thing .
But nobody will uninteristed by a new thing .
Even doing so well in one job or something still can try new things .
It could be use in the old thing you are doing so well or may find another way to use for the things that already know very well .

World is changing every day .
Many years ago , people use pen and paper to write a letter to their family to tell family they are doing well aborade .
It takes a month to get the letter .
In that time people still using horse for ride .
Nowadays , people use Internet to view the news to chat and the most popular way to send family `` I 'm doing well. '' is e-mail .
People do not need use a day to get to another town .
We have car , train and airplan to travel around the world .
Trying new things is not weasting time , it could saving much more time for people to do the things they want to do .

Starting doing a new things .
It could be very hard and boring .
But still can find a lot fun by doing it .
People may making a lot mistake when they trying a new thing , after know how to use it then think about the mistake you are making you may laugh at your self .
Also people would find out another way to saving time to do more things they would like and want to do .

New things is not a bad thing to try .
If people just close the door for new things the things will lose in your life could be a lot .
Taking new things is not tell people put down what you are doing , is tell people to try things , it would help you a lot .
