Both learning facts and understanding ideas are important .
Neither one of them dominates another .
On the one side , learning facts helps people to get experience so that they can understand and generate ideas better ; on the other side , the ability which people has to understand ideas affects people 's performance to learn facts .

Everyone starts to learn things from learning facts first .
For example , young children start to learn facts when they start to go to school .
They might learn that seventy five percent of the surface of the earth area is covered by water .
This knowledge is not from understand ideas but from facts .
Another example is that young children learn that fire burns and hurt people by touching fire because they have no idea about fire before they get hurt .

However , only learning facts would not help students to get knowledge effiently , they must go to school or somewhere else to learn ideas .
For example , some of the the knowledges learned by students at school are ideas .
When students have enough knowledge and ideas , they would learn facts deeper and broader .

Understanding ideas and learning facts should not be separate .
Both of them are the ways to help students to abtain knowledges .
