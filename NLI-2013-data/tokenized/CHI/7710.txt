I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The advantage is that when going on a trip , you are not familiar with the place , so being led by a tour guide is better than going around the place by yourself and getting lost .
The disadvantage is that you ca n't choose which place to go to , you also have to wake up very early and get prepared for the journey you are having that day .

Last year , I went to Guilin , which is in China .
My family hired a tour guide .
I remember that we had to wake up at 7am and had to be ready by 7:30am .
We went around the city and my legs were very sore by the time we returned to the hotel .
The tour guide was not really friendly and my family was not pleased with her .
We also had to go in a group , which was not such a pleasant experience .
There was another family who was always late for arrivals .
And everybody was displeased with them .

Another experience was that a few years ago in Malaysia , my mother also hired a tour guide .
The tour guide was very greedy and not very polite .
On another trip to Bangkok , we did not hire a tour guide and we went around Bangkok by ourselves .
I think that my family and I had a much more delightful holiday and we had a lot of fun there .

In my opinion , I think that hiring a tour guide is not as good as going around by yourself .
Though you may not know the place very well , you can always ask the local people who live there , I am sure at least one of them is willing to tell you the directions of the place .
Tour guides may not be very professional and their manners may not be that polite .
So I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
