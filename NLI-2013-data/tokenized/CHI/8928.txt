Nowadays , students are leading to learn more theories , but have a lack of knowledge of the real facts .
In my opinion , i do n't think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .
To prove my opinion , i have three reasons .

First of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flowers , trees , birds , etc. they are all the creatures , we can touch , smell , and hear .
Students should be taught how to admire these real things ( facts ) in our daily life , the ideas and concepts can not help students to learn more about the creatures .

Second of all , most of the ideas and concepts are in the book , if students are just studing theses ideas and concepts , than they will lose many chances to be in touch with Nature .
In contrast , Nature may help children find more ideas and concepts than in the books throughout the practice in the outside .

Last but not the leat , the ideas and concepts are the results from the scientists or the phylogists , they may get these ideas and concepts in wrong ways .
According to today 's registrations , many new and correct ideas and concepts are out .
But in students ' books , the ideas and concepts do n't be improved , so students may get the wrong information about the facts .
Then , at this time , experiment is much more important , let students get correct ideas and concepts by themselves .
For example , physics and chemistry can not lust learn the ideas and concepts , students must have a objective configuration of the physical and chemical facts .

To sum up , the Nature , the Practice , and the Experiment are the better means for students to get ideas and concepts of the facts .
In these ways , they can not only learn the truth in the books , but also learn more about facts throuth the process of getting knowlege .
