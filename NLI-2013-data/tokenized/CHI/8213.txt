The issue of wheather understand the ideas and concept is more important than learn facts has been a long time disputed .
And people are entitled to opinions .
From my point of view , I strongly side with the later groups who believes learn facts are more inportant .
There are numbers reasons to support this , but in the following passage I will only present the major ones .

First of all , learnig the facts can let them to be a crativity learner .
In this world , everything have two view sides : right or wrong .
Tt is important for you to choose which way you will do .

If students just understant the ideas and concepts escept the facts , they wil do not know change when they meet the new facts .
so learn facts is more important .
Becuse it can let them thinking what it is , and what we will do .

Second of all , learning facts can gain more knowledge , when you know how to solve this problems you will also thinking whether this pattern can slove this kinds of things .
If it can not so what we will do , we will ask ourselves or any other people .
Lao zi , a chinese psychologist , once said : there have a teacher in any three persons .
It means that everbody have the things that you need to learn , If we want to be a knowledge persons we need to asks and get the helps from other peoples .

Lastly , learning facts can you learn the communication ability , because when you learn the facts , you probably need to know more details about the facts and you can disscuse and improve that you said it is correct , so you need to explain you ideas to let other peoples know , It good for you to communicate and let you to be a welcome one to them .
Understant ideas and concept can only let you be a receiver but learn the facts can help you be a scholar , you need to think to improve what you say and what you think , be a crative lea
