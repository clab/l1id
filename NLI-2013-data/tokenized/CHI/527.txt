this is a conversial issue about it is better that learn different aspects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Depengding on personal experience , personality type and emotional concern .
We may find that some people hold the idea about learn broad knowleg ; on the other hand , some people might choose learning in one specific subject .
The answer , nevertheless , is not easy to make , with all aspects carefully considered , I deem that former one is more reasonable .

The essential reason that why I agree with the above statement is that learning different subjects will make people have more experience when he iis in the trouble .
A good case in point is the affair happened in my hometown last year .
Some students in my hometown decided to have a trip in desert , before they went , they prepared all the thing .
However , they met the problem in the second day , a girl was sick because the bad enviroment , the madicine they took is useless .
When everybody did not know what to do , a boy who study botany used the mothed he studied in the extra class to save the girl .
So , learning extra subjuct is a sensible choice .

Another reason can be seen by every one is that learning broad konwledge will make people know more friends .
Take different class will let you know more classmate , and it is important that the friend will help you when you be in trouble .
The case is not isolate , it is typical of donzens I have heard .
Althought different views about this topic is exist , I still vote for learning broad knowledges .

Although the merits of learning one specific subject is recognized , it is evident that the drawbacks is far outweigh them .
Learning one subject will make people boring sometimes , it is not good for people that always think one aspect .
So , with the evidence offer , I will choose learning different subject as my opinion .

Judging from all evidence offered , we can draw the conclusion that have extra knowledge will be good at both experience and making friends .
So , to be frank , I strongly commit the notion that studing broad of many acsdemic , but not only one subject .
