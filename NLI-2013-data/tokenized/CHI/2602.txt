Does young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
The person who asks this question in the present day may receive more positive answers .
Yet , I think this question will have a various answer due to the time it is asked .

In the present day , new technologies keep being developed each day .
For the most parts , young children and adolesents are usually the targets which the technologies are designed for .
The gaming consoler war ( PS3 , Xbox360 , Netindo Wii ) during last Christmas appeared to be a perfect example .
The gaming market has targeted all the younger groups instead of those older people .
Therefore , then young people have more choices to relex themselves right now and in the future .
Also , most of considered `` young '' people are still in the progress of learning .
It can have more possibilities to develope new interest while learning or trying a new thing .
Once the interest is ensured , young people know how they should have fun with it .

Yet , that applies to the present days .

On the other hand , if this question was being asked in the past like 18th or even 16th centry , then most answers may appear to be towards to older people .
In the past , young people have to deal with educational and economical problems harder than those well-established adults .
The younger groups did not appear having time to enjoy the life before they 're grown .
But the older people might enjoy the life as much as they could .
By looking over the history , old barons and nobles had way more advantage on enjoying life than the young children .

In conclusion , I think that the young people obiously enjoy life more now .
As a young adult , I can easily feel the technology has placed a neat road for us , the young ones .
The young people have more adcantage on enjoy life in today 's world
