Some people think the successful people always try the new things and take risks , whereas other people think the successful people usually do what they already know how to do well .
As my point of view , I think the successful people will try to use the different views and do the distict things that other people never do before .
There are several reasons to support my viewpoint as below .

I suggest that the successful people will always view the things in the different way , That is because the society now changes dramatically than before .
Therefore , if we did n't know the trend of society , we will be phase out one day .
In this situation , successful people must be a person who monitors the change of the society and always reminds himself to be the pioneer of the society .
In this reason , they will always to be the person who have willings to try the new things and to understand all the new concept of lots of fields such as political views and managing perspectives .

Furthermore , since the competition of the world is enormous and lots of the things is changing day by day .
A successful people must to be use the latest way or thoughts to keep up his advantages .
On the other hand , if someone always focus on what he has known and what he is good at , he will never know that the new things have brought the quite big impact on the world and his skill will be never be used in the future .
So , a successful person must be a person who always know the trend of the world and try the lastest the method to deal with the things he faced .

To take Bill Gates to be an example , he is no doubt to be a successful person who try the new things and take risks rather than only doing what he already know how to do well .
He has the uniqe view to realize that the software will be very popular and important in the world .
Although lots of people though that the software was not so vital as the hardware is , Bill Gates still insisted his opinion , and then created the Microsoft and to be one of the greastest influencing person in the world .

In conclusion , I think the successful people must be a individual who have brave to do somethings that no body have courage to do it .
Therefore , he can always keep his advantages and continuously create the new things and bright the benifit for the world .
