I am so agree with the statement .
This is also what i like to do all the time , being a creative people .
I think this is very important to be a successful people .

I think if people want to be sucessful , you have to take risk , try something new that people do n't know very well .
Because if you keep doing the things people already know a lot about it , You ca n't be better than the people who are very professional on it .
There are a lot of famous people in the world .
Why could they be so successful ?

Because they keep trying new things .
For example , Bill Gazs , the rishest man in the world .
But do you know he dropped out of the college in the second year .
Do you think if he did n't take the risk of dropping out of the college to try something new or you can call the computer revolution , he would be so successful like this .
I guess it is no .

However , if you keep doing the microsoft ware now , you would not be successful on it , i am pretty sure it will not .
Because no body can produce the microsoft product better than he do .
That is why you have to produce something new , something quite different and more convenient .

A lot of people are being normal , because they do n't rather to take risk , even if he is very good at it and have very good oppurtunities .
Of course we ca n't ignor those people who want to be normal .
This is why successful people are usually few in the society .
I bevelive successful people 's life should be very exciting , and they are the kind of people who like exciting .
Because they take risk , and nobody would know what is going to come out .
And sucess would be one of the results .
Is n't it exciting ?
