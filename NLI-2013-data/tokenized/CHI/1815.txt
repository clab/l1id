Now I am at the later of 20s .
Combining my own experience and borrowing experiences of my friends in China , I tend to disagree with the statement .
In my point of view , both young and the older people knows the importance of enjoying life , however , young people are different from the older one in how frequency , what and why to enjoy life .

To start with , mostly young people enjoy life in a different pace from the older one .
I think this is one of the factors that mislead others believe that young guys are enjoying life more than the older ones .
During weekends or typical vacation seasons , we can easily find young men or women emerging almost every corners of trendy entertainment places , ranging from hot scenic spots to cute bars in the town .
On the contrary , older people are rarely found .
However , we have to understand more behind that .
These occassions are the best time for the young guys to go out since normally during the weekday , they have to spend time in the office from 800am to late as 800pm .
It should be more fair to conclude if we considered that it was also the young people who spent most of time during the weekday to work overtime .

Secondly , young people enjoy life in a variety of forms which are quite different from the older ones .
Activities such as reading , playing cards or Majiang ( a traditional Chinese game ) , or watching TV programs are favorite ones for older people .
However , nowadays , young people have different funs to enjoy .
They enjoy to have activities in a more lively and trendy form such as fitness exercise , hiking , drinking and sharing with friends in the bars .
Since those trendy activities are more publicized , it is easy to conclude that young people enjoy life more than the older ones .

Lastly , it is the different view toward life that determines the variance between young peope and older ones when they enjoy life .
Contrary to older people who more often view life and work are seamless connected in China , youngsters will treat life and work separately .
They understand that work is disconnected from life .
In some extent , a happy life is the basis for a successful work .
Therefore , it is critical to enjoy life to full when off work while to concentrate on work vice versa .
