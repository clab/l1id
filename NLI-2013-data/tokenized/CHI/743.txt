Do you take over a lots of kinds of knowledge with you ?
The most people who had great work 's experentes think that the student who are still studying in the school or university should to take broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects , because they think that it is better to childrens to get carrer when they grow up .
However , I do not agree with those people , and i think take one specific subject only is better than anthor .
I will list my spcial reasons in the following .

First of all , I just think that take one specific subject and study it very well is much better than study a lots of kinds of subjects .
Because a person who only need take one of subjects could live well in the world , and if this guy can learn it very well , then , this guy will become a famous person in this subject .
If a person who study broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects will not learn very well i think , because one have no enough time to take those subject very , only can half-understand about this subject .

secondly , rght now , in the world most companys which always need some guy who is professional in one 's subject area , because they have no time to get some person who is not good at this subject , and to teach one how to work on it , they would like to get some guy who is good at this subject , because this guy are really take well on this skills , and do not need to spend time for study it again .
On this way , the company who take this preson will have better infulence of work .

Finally , I think a prson who studly a lots of kinds of subject is not good , because those guy will spend a lots of time on those subject and cannot take it well .
The reason is not those guy are stupid , just because it is too difficult .
Everybody should know that the time is money for us , we have not idea to find it back , so we have to treasure the every hour and every minutes , ever every seconds .

In the concultion , I just think the people who are only take one subject is better to study on a lots of kinds of subject , and this way will make more earier on one 's road of life .
