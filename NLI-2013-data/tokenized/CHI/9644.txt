Will we success if we always make a decision through the old way ?
In my opinions , this is a quit clealy answer .
I believed that if we want to creative a really achivement , we have to make change that 's for sure .
If someone wants to be successful , he or she must have the characters bellow : First of all , old things wo n't attract people .
For instance , we wo n't buy another product for their same function or appear .
We will purchase something because of its newest and fleshest nomatter in any aspects .

In addition , ability in make a right decision is a key to success .
The differents between the leader and members is determine alility .
It is obvious to look their position in salary .
Leader were the one got the high payment in a job .

Finally , the most important character in successful people is a precisely foresee .
This is the heart for a person who will earn the respect and acomplishment .
Those people always saw the opportunities we will never see and seize this adventage to make a big profits and large benefit .

To sum up , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because they have the talents or abilities to convince people to join with them , make the right decision without pain as well , and saw the chances advence .
