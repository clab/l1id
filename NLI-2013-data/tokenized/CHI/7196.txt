I have experienced both travel in a group led by a tour guide and travel by myself .
Some poeple think that travel in group with tour guide is better than travel without a tour guide .
While , others have opposite idea .
I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a gruop led by a tour guide .
Because this is the most safe way and enjoyable way for travel .

The first reason that I agree this statement is because we all want to have a safe travel .
It is dengulous that you do not really understant the cultures or lendgrages where you travel .
I read a news that some Chinesses travel to Malysia without leding by a tour guide , they have been sent to jail because they played ganbo in the hotel room .
Some things are not be a problem in our own controy does not means that is no problem in others either .
Therefore , I think that having a tour guide is the most safe way for travel .

Another reason that I think that travel in a group is better idea is because we do not have to worry about : has the hotel booking confirmed ?
or where I can take bus for the place that I want to go ?
All you have to do is just follow the tour guides .
Because of they ecperience , I believe that they know better than I do about the cities that I visit .
Like where have good shippingmalls or restaruants .
I like to follow the tour guides and listen to them explain the history of the city or other interesting stories .
This is also a advertage that you do not have by travel along .

Although there are some advertages of travel by along such as not time limite or no shchedule needs to follow .
However , The advertages of travel in a group are more obvious than travel along .
In conculsion , travel by follow some one who has experience is the best way for travel .
Expecially the place that you have never been .
So than we can ttotally enjoy our vacation .
