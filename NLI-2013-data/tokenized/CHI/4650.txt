Nowadays , one of the most intriguing issues is that whether the majority of the advertisements makes their merchandise look much better than they really are .
As far as I am concered , I agree with this opinion , with three follwing reasons .

Firstly , the advertisers attracts the public attentions by making full use use of the `` clarity effect '' .
Although the cost on the super stars is always unbelievably high , the producers can also gain profit by the advertisement acted by the clarity .
It is true that since the super movie star or singer appeared in the advertisement on the screen , people have memorized the product because of their favorable clarity and are probably buy the product .
But unfortunately , the public know little about what they have bought .

Secondly , the advertiser aggrandizes the function of the products sometimes .
For example , an advertisement mentions that you can keep all day long energitic by drinking an energy drink .
In other words , you are still active even after you stay up for 24 hours .
If so , why does the scientists always mention the importance of the 8 hours sleeping time ?

Lastly , the advertiser sometimes emphasize one its benefit of the product but deliberately ignore the negative effect .
A brand of medicine to keep fit points out in its advertisements how much weight you can lose after a couple of weks .
However , the medicine has a bad effect on the nerves of the takers to prohibit their desire to take food .

All in all , most advertisements make their products seem much better than the originals .
Although it will add the profit for the producers , in the moral light , it is a deceving behavior for the public .
