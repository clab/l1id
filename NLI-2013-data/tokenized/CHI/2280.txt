There is no denying that whether young people enjoy their lives more than the older people do has become controversial , not only to professionals , but also to the public as a whole .
It takes all sorts to make the world .
Some believe that young people enjoy their lives more than the older , and would like to put an end to it , while others who think older people enjoy their lives more maintain the disagreement to it .
As far as I am concerned , i vote for the latter .
There are numerous reasons why i choose to disagree with the given statement , and I would in here explain a few of the most important ones .

In the first place , it is easily observed in modern society , young people have to endure more pressure and competition that older people do .
Both common sense and our knowledge can inform us that most young people have to deal with peer-pressure .
What 's more , in order to survive later in their lives , they are facing enormous competition with other youngsters .
An illustrative example that can be easily found .
High school students have to worry and struggle for their marks in order to acquire an considerablely good education .
In contrast , old people just need to go to community centres and enjoy their lives .

After all things considerred , I think the most important reason for stating older people enjoy their lives more is that they are respected by younger people .
In other words , their lives are more appreaciated and high-classed emotionally and psychologically .
An example that accompnies this point is that a senior with a family can be respected by his/her children or even grandchildren .
According to a recent survey by Statistic Canada , 80 % people whose ages are below 30 believe that older people should be respected and 90 % of those who are older think they are happy and appreaciative about the respect they get from young people .

Nevertheless , young people 's lives can be more enjoyable to some extent , such as a higher energy level they obtain in their daily lives , but this merit is speculative .
After considerring the bigger picture , you will think believing older people have better lives is a wise option .

After understanding all the reasoning above , it is now safe to say that stating older people 's lives are more enjoyable is a more sagacious and wise action .
