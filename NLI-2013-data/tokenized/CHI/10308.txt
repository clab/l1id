There are so many successful people in today 's society .
These people can be students , business man or even workers .
Generally , all areas have successful people .
I agree with the opinion that these kinds of people always try somthing new even though they need to face risks .
However , they wo n't do the thing they already know quite well .
I think this is a kind of spirit called enterprise .

I want to ask a question at first - how can people make success ?
Can people always do the same thing which he is already professional on succeed ?
The answer is obviously - No .
We cannot deny that people should make great efforts to improve you own skills .
Is that enough ?
You just focous on one thing , and you make it then pefect .
You can be proud of it .
But one skill is not enough espacially in today 's society which is quite competitve .
You always need to improve yourself .
Otherwise , you will not be able to catch up with the development of the society or other people 's steps .

Everyone has the desire to be successful , but actuary not everyone has been successful already .
Why ?
The differnce between successful people and common peole is whether they are brave enough .
A successful people must be unfaithful to take all kind of challenges .
These challenges will come out once you face a new thing .
Maybe someone has already tried a new thing but they dare to face the risks .
They go back to the place where they stay before .
Successful must be happy to take these risks then they can make perfect .
Everyone know Bill Gates , he is very successful , he is still working on the new programs .
That is why he can be the No.1

Do not envy the successful people in the society .
They have their own way to succeed .
In other words , they can do the things others dare to or cannot do .
Undertake a new thing out of your scale , without faith , you can succeed as well .
