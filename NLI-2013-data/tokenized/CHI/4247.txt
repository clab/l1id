Communities are made up of people and a community can only improve or be better if people in the community are willing to help and spend time on it .
I agree that young people nowadays are occupied by so many other things that their certain community is ignored .

It is true that as the country develops the fundamental unit of the society - communities become more and more important .
Activities are organised to raise the awarness of certain things which people tend to forget as they become busier .
For example , fundrasing ideas are often raise in my school to either raise the awarness of Mali , the country which we are spouncering or to raise money for their education or particular events happening in school .
The 12th grades has just did a spouncer walk to raise the spirits and awarness of Mali .
The outcome was a great success , more student have a further understanding of what is Mali like at the same time more than 700 pounds is raise throught the activity .

Yet , as the industry develops , people race with time .
Things are forgotten especially when people are busy and therefore participate less in the community .
For instance , as a senior in the school , there are so many things that I need to worry , such as university application , personal statement and the academic work .
There are very little time that I could spend on other things else such for example , being part of the Student Government which improves students ' lifes at school or join sports team as an interest .
These after school activites are time consuming , for students like me , time can said to be the most important factor at this stage and should eb used to study .

In conlusion , young people like students nowadays do n't spend so much time helping their communities , one reason is because students are occuppied by studying , another is reason is becasue if there are more intersting things to do such as going to a movie , why bother to help the community which does n't have direct effect on them .
