i agree the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
there are lots of products that people can see or buy in the market .
but the advertisements want to make money , so they just make the products seem much better to make people wo n't know its good or bad inside .

for example , the little boy in the cady shop , he would like to have a big colorful cady but not the no color one .
because the colorful one seem better then another one .
it doesnt mean that the colorful one test better then the other .
but the little boy chose the colorful one so the coloeful one win anyways .
i believe that 's why advertisements make products looks good then people would buy it and they can make money .
and usually the things which looks good outside it cost more expenciner then the things which looks ugly , but the expencive one may not really useful then the cheaper one .

another example , i think that people always choose the thing that looks good but they dont really care what is really inside of the products so thats why the advertisements keep making thing like only have outside .
so when people chose the things we shoule read the manul carefully before we buy it .

there are the examples of why i think most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are .
i think now days is impossible to chose the thing that not only looks good but also useful .
