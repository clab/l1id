Recently , traveling is a good activity for each one 's vacation .
Each one want to have a great time traveling around the world to broaden his horizon .
There are two choices of going traveling , in a group led by a tour guide or on your own way .
If I were the one who have time to travel , i would choose the second one to enjoy my leisure time .

There are a lot of reasons that I choose to have a trip on my own way .
Although you do not agree with me , I would give you some explanations .
First of all , it is a internet age that you can find any information on the webs all around the world .
Everything is transparent that you can find out the price of hotel , plane , and so on .
Even the better suggestion you can ask for is easy to get on the internet .

Second , I would give you my bad experiences of trip with a group led by a tour guide .
The tour guide or the traveling agent makes a look-liking beautiful plan for your vacation .
That is just a crowd schedule that include almost every worthy traveling place to attract you .
However , this is always a busy trip being unable to relax your good time if you join them .
I can not question that the tour guide have plenty of knowledge about where you want to travel , but I can confirm that you never have a relaxing time following a big group of travelers .

Third and the last , it might take you some time to plan a journey rather than take a second to call the travel agent up .
I will say it is worthy preparing your own journey .
Planning might be a hard thing but it is such an easy thing that you utilize the information on the internet well .
After a hard-working plan , the real trip that you want will come true like a fairy tale .
In addition , you will gain a lot of unforgetable memory and experience in the spontanous trip .
The trip is easier than waht you thought before .
