Nowadays more and more young people do n't care about their livning communities .
They spend a lot of time on their study works in school or cream school .
Even they have free time they may use it on their entainment activities , like go shoping with friends or family .
Although there still some young people have pay some attention to their communities , it is my believe that they do n't give enough time to help their communities .

The first reason that caused the young people ca n't devote more time to their communities is that the high competitive pressure in the education system .
Their parents wish their child can get a good grades in different subjects that caused them need to attend different courses .
Even ater the day time from the school , they need to take some courses in the cram school to do some supplements .
In addition , while they have free time after the hard work in their study .
They usually use it to do some entainments , like see the movie or sing the song in the KTV with their classmates or friends .
Furthermore , due the the busy work of their parents that cause the fathers and mothers did n't have much time to edcuate their kids , not to metion to teach their kids to do something helpful to their communities .

So from point of veiw , if we want to encourage the young people to do more in our communities , we need to take more effort on our education .
Firstly , we need to encourage the parents to take their children to attend some activity in our community .
Let these young people to know more their society .
Then in the school , we need to allocate more time to teach the importance of helping communities , not just ask the student to focus on their study .

Through these improvement , I believe the young people will pay more time in their community than before .
And the problems in the community will reduce and whole socity will become more stronger .
