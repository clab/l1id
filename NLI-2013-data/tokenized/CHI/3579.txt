I agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I myself is reluctant to participate in community activities .
The reasons are varied .
For example , the Mid Autumn Festival is coming , the bar-be-cue seems just not so interesting to attend because you need to do it with a group of elderly people .
Community borad often expects young adults to do all kinds of chores simply because they are younger and more engetic .
It is true but young people lose their interests in attending under this logical consequence .
If a communitiy only expects young people to contribute rather than gain benefits , why would young adults join the activities it offers .

Community activities are usually designed for families in the neighbordhood .
The subjects would be natually grandparents , parents and children .
It costs a lot to design a program that is suitable for everyone 's needs .
If each house as a unit to decide what they want to do within their own budget , it will attract more interests for people to spend their holidays .
Besides , community 's activities are very limited in kind .
They may just have kraok , bar-b-cue and riddles .
I would believe young adults will chose what is suitable for them outside of the community and have fun as much as possible , such as KTV instead of kraok or movie .
It may be even more exciting by going to a bar and drink to their upmost with their close friends .
After all , it is much more fun in the world outside than the daily in and out neighborhood .

One major issue in community is garbage .
Not every community has a good system of running recycle items .
People have the tendency to leave their garbages in a certain spot where nobody is at the scene seeing them do that .
Graduately , it becomes a trash mountain .
It is very common in Taiwan .
With issue like this , community needs volenteers to guard the spot and supervise the dumping process when trash truck comes .
Young adults have energy to do that but they are not so respectable enough to argue with elderly ladies or men .
It increases the reluctances for young people to interact with their neighbours .
It is reasonable that young people keep their noses out of community board .
It is just too much to handle to a young adult .
