As the modern society is developing faster and faster , more and more better facilities , interesting things that did n't happen in the old years appear , our youth is absolutely served more confortable than those older people in such world .
3 aspects of reasons or exemples can be shown to support my vote for the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people .

For instance , my city has just built an gorgeous play park where you can enjoy most excting and thrill play facilities .
I have been there 3 times with my parents .
Every time when I immersed myself into those attractive play events my parents just sat there to look at me `` flying up and down '' because they are a little bit of old for those play events , they may have some worries even a little fear toward them .

As we all know , young people nowadays often prefer to do a lot of things on computer such as shopping , reading and sometimes studying through the internet .
On the other hand , older people more often have trouble dealing with these machines which can bring a lot of convinience to our work , study and life .
As a result , older people can only solve problem all by themselves .
But how can they keep up the fast pace of the modern world with their lower efficient ?
They will have less time to enjoy the beautiful life .

As far as I was concern , young people are more adaptable to the quickly-changing world , They easily convert their thoughts of things ; they are more likely to change their attitudes towards life and the way of living .
Whenever newer and nicer things appear , the young will be the first to take them , follow them and enjoy them while older people always have cold feet to new things and always over thinking `` so-called '' risks of those things .

In conclusion , I raise both of my hands to agree with the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
