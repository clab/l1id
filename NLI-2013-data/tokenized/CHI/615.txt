Many people want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
They think others will show respect to them because of their broad knowledge .
Of course , to know a lot costs time and energy .
It 's a provement of one 's ability .
If one does have broad knowledge but not specialize in any subjects , does it good for him or her ?
I do n't think so .

If one has broad knowledge of many academic , he or she would n't have enough time to specialize in any of the subjects as the human-being 's ability and energy are limited .
But the fact is , most people should or would have works in a certain period of time .
A certain work needs one to own a specific ability to solve certain problems .
That means the one who have lots of knowledge of many subjects ca n't do anything at all .
Their knowledge are too superficial to deal with any problems .
So this kind of people are likely to loose their jobs as their knowledge ca n't help anything .
They are like some old-fashion liberaries .

Another inefficiency is that they do n't gain as much satifactory feeling as the people who are specialize in one specific subject .
Their broad knowledge may come from books , lectures or internet .
But they just recite the things which are provided by others .
They ca n't make up anything or develope any ideas as they spend all their times in searching other 's comments or points of view .
In contrast , the people who are specialize in one specific subject can think of ideas they are interested in more thoroughly and deeply than others .
They may gain something by their own .
We all know that creation can make one pride and content .
Of course , repeating others ' things ca n't be called creation .
So the people who have broad knowledge can never feel this kind of feelings .

What I mean is not to suggest people to study only one subjects .
To know many things can bring benefits to us .
But at the same time , you should specialize in one subject or you 'll find there is nothing you could do in the future .
