I do n't agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
As for me , traveling is kind of like trausure hunting .
Why traveling is always interesting ?
That 's becuase a unknown futrue .
Once u are on the way , you 'll never know what will happen or who will u meet .
Every experience will be like a surprising gift and ever friend will be your valuable fortune in your life .
The best thing to explore the world on your own is to crate memories by yourself .

Some people would think it 's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away .
That way , you do n't have to wasting too much time finding places .
And even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book .
Actually , the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots who can make them money .
The rush schedule and the arrangement from a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel .
Most of people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind .

The point I want to make is the real meaning of travel is not only to relax yourself but also to learn the experience from the real world , not from the book anymore .
It 's not hard to arrange a safe and fun tour by yourself .
Before you go to travel , you can collect much information from the Internet , your friends who have ever been there or even the traveling books .
Through the suggestions they give you , and do a well prepartion in advance , there 's no doubt you 'll have a wonderful tour without a tour guide .
You can freely charge your time of staying or decide what kind of places you prefer to visit .
