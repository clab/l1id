I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are meant to convince potential buyers to purchase certain items .
Therefore , in order to convince the buyers , advertisements almost always make products appear better than they really are .
My reading of an article on the local newspaper and my personal experience of purchasing a skin care product prove this point to be true .

I once read an article on a local newspaper that informed readers about the art of advertisement .
The article said that in order to convince the potential buyers to purchase certain items , the advertising market must make the products to appear as amazing as possible , even if they appear better than they actually are .
So that potential buyers will be convinced of the products ' worth and effectiveness .
If the advertisements make the products seem worse or the way they really are , they will have a more difficult time to convince buyers .
In my opinion , the article had a point .

In addition to the article , my personal experience also proves that most advertisements make products seem better .
I have always wanted clear , smooth skin .
I remember seeing an advertisement of a skin care product on the television .
The product was described in the advertisement to be so effective that I was completely convinced before even trying it .
However , after purchasing the skin care product and using it for two months , I still had countless pimples on my face and the quality of my skin did not improve at all .
This experience showed me that advertisement make products much better than they really are .

Both the article on my local newspaper and my personal experience prove to me that most advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .
In numerous cases , the products that buyers purchase in reality do not live up to their descriptions in their advertisements .
So next time when I purchase an item , I will not judge its worth and effectiveness just by looking at its advertisement .
