Taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people .
Some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide , they think that it is more quiet and peaceful .
As for me , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
But I disagree with considering it as a best way to travel .

First , most of people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel .
In some scenarios , it may very dangerous to traveler .
For example , if you travel alone in a forest where the modern technology can not be used to communicate with outside world .
Imagine if you miss your way in the forest , meet some dangerous animals or get injured by accident , how would you continue you travel .
In this situation , it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel .
But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .
Your friends can help you if there is really some bad things happened .
And since there is a tour guide , the opportunity of occuring some bad things may decreases .
So you can totally enjoy your travel without always worring about all kinds of situations .

second , common sense tells us that human beings are social animals .
So for most of people , they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone .
Imagine , you and your friends in a travel , you can talk some funny things , you can share some feelings , or play card with your friends .
People in group will make you travel more interesting , you have more things to do .
However , if you travel alone without a tour guide , you are been deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends .

However , I disagree with the claims that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Because the modern society provides us many opportunities to choose .
Some people can choose to travel by other way by their own option .
But I recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them .

So , generally , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way .
Since , you may get more pleasures .
And the travel are safer to you .
But I think that travel in other way is still a good way to some people by preparing well .
