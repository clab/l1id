I totally agree with this statement .
Firstly , travelling in group led by a tour guide is convenient .
leading by a tour guide , you may not have to worry about the issues during the travel .
For example , you need not to think about which hotel you shoud choose to live in , where you have a meal , and which cars or trains you should take .
Every thing is arranged well by tour guide .
Only thing you need to do is to follow the group , see beautiful sight and enjoy them fully .

Also , you can get many knowledge and insight from the presentation of tour guide .
Tour guides is given good training or education on how to introduce the information about sight to tourist .
In this sense , they are professional persons who are most familiar with the information of sight .
Having a introduction from the tour guide , I believe all of you will get comprehensive knowledge without any efforts .
However , when you take a lonely travel , no one provides this kind of services and you may miss the best chance to learn about the world sight .

Moreover , there are often many people in a travel group .
I am a sociable person and I like to do many things with other people .
I hate loneliness .
Of course , this include travel .
Also , making new friends is one of my hobbies .
Traveling in a group meets all of my needs above .

At last , traveling in a group always means low cost .
It is well known that single travel spends much more than group travel .
Now i am not very rich and if I want to travel , I definitly choose group travel .

Because of all those benefits of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , I believe it is the best way for me to travel .
