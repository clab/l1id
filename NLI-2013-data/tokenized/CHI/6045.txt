The problem that reducing the cars in use have been argue for a long time in the newspaper or the TV programs .
Different people have differet view .

Having a car is dream deeply rooted in come people 's dream .
However , most people seem to fail to account the fact that using the car lead to many problem which can lead to some terrible results , in years ago and even now .

For my part , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
Because of people 's care about the health problem .
Although , there many reasons can prove many view , I just want to explore some of them below .

In the first place , few cars in use can make our evironment much more chean .
During the car 's running they producing a lot of useless gas which can pollute our air .

In the second place , reduce the car in use can give people some changes to do much sports such as running or walking .
People are uesd to drive no matter how near the ending is .
Doing more sports can make people'body have a tendcey to the health situation , as everybody ' willing .

In the third place , car 's running is depend on buring the oil whose price is in a growing number .
If we do n't use cars at all time , we can save a large number of oil and save lots of money .

From the reasons I mentioned above , we can safty draw a conclusion tha there will be fewer cars in use in many years .
Even cars make make our life more easy , its disadventages is out weigh than its adventages .
So there will be fewer cars in use than there
