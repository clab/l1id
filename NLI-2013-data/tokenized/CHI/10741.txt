In my opinion , successful people do like to try new things and take risks , in other words , I think being a successful people have to try something new .
I think the most obvious example is of Einstain .
Einstain is the richest man on this planet , but what makes him so rich that makes him maintain being first place of thegloble invetigate of the income .

I think it 's his personality of trying something new , his talents and also his bravity to take risk .
I 'd heard about something interesting about Einstain in his childhood .
When he was in junior high school , he did n't like other kids who just played in the playgroud or chased after one another , he prefer to sit in front of the only computer in his school and disolved it and assembled it back after .
This weird behavior annoied many teachers in school because Einstain usually not going back to the classroom even the bell ringed .
He had been flunk for many times due to these funny reasons .
However , no one can predict that such a weird boy will be the most successful man after several decades .

When Einstain finally graduated from high school , he made a disicion that he wants to make everyone knows how fascinated was the computer and lets everyone has one on their own desk .

He tried hard to make his dream come true but it did have many
