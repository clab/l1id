In the current society , the combined ability is always be required .
Especially the basic capacity of English and computer .
In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

As I mentioned above , more and more jobs need people to have more than one abilities .
Such as my major is finance and banking , but if I just be familiar with how the banks operations , it is firely not enough .
Because with the developing of the banking system , a lot of new and comprehensive things occered to banks and they have to accept them because of the harsh competition .
For example , the bonds relatived to the performance of many companys .
We have to have the good knowledge of accouting and mathmatics to do it .
It showes that have broad knowledge could meet the requirement .

Have many skills also help us have a broader carrer range .
If one only specialize in one specific subject , he or she could only doing one job for his/her whole life .
If he/she find the job is boring or not the real things they like to do , there is no chance to change for him/her , which is really regretful .
We can easy to turn to other jobs with a broad knowledge and we can solve the problems we meet by more than one method .

I can not imagine that doing one thing all my life .
I love to change .
I love the excitement that changes give me .
The changes can make my life colourful and happy .
So I choose to have a broad abilities .

The broad knowledge make us do our jobs better as well .
Such as with the wonderful logical thinking of maths and good foundation of Chinese , I can make the banking essays more perfect !
