I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , most advertisements tell us the adventages of the products and do not mention the disadvantades .
Advertisements are generall short .
In order to inpress people advertisements have to say the most inportant advantage and do not have time to tell people the shortcomes .
So people will consider the products better than they really are .

Second , some products have different effects to different people .
It is good to you , maybe it is no effects on me .
The advertisements only give us the good example , such as the drug for lossing weight .
My friend use many kinds of products to loss weight .
Every time she told me that she have seen the result of using this products from advertisements , but she disppointed every time .

Third , some advertisements use inaccrute word .
For example , a advertisement said that the drug for lossing weight is very , very effective .
But what means `` very , very effective '' ?
Every person has his/her own oppoinons .
Some people think it means that this will decrease 10 % of weight , but other people think it means to decrease 20 % of weight .
To the factory of this goods , `` very , very effective '' maybe means decrease 5 % .

So I think I can not beleive all of what the advertisements said .
