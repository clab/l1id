Although many people think that there is nothing to worry while there is a guide .
He would be responsible for all the needs they want .
I personally disagree with the assertion that to go with a tour guide is the best way to travel .

First of all , traveling with a group could waste much time waiting for other person .
And it is very unconvenient to go trevel with a lot of people , especially they are all strangers to me .
There will be several rules that you should follow .
It is not romance and happy at all .

Second , the tour guide often wants to have a aboundant impression that all the people in the group .
The plcaes are arranged too much ; in the end , there always no enough time to spend on each place the group been .
I could not remember or experence the environments where I only spend five minutes to stay with .
I need more time and enjoy the difference between where I live .

Last but not least , I have heard more than one time that people have the same impression about the same country they have been .
It is because the guide always take people to the same place .
For example , It is the same that the pictures of my friends and my parents which they took at Frence , only the faces are different .
However , I want something more than all the people 's experiences .

To see the real things happening in the foreign coutries is more attracted than the photos on the post cards .
In conclusion , it is not interesting at all if I can not decide where I want to go .
The most interesting part of traveling is to study the country and decide where to go , and it would be better if there are some things unexpected happened .
Going with a group is definately mot one of my choice .
