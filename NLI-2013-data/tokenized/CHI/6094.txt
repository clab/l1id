A scene in which private cars disappeared , instead many mini and high-tech buses run and roar on streets seems like a complete science fiction ; but I believe this will come ture in twenty years , because too mush space is possesed by humans , huge clouds of dust and polluted air hanging on the sky , and new way of transportation is needed .

Currently , a huge number of buildings are under construction in our tiny city .
We already felt that grass and plants for us were scared .
However , facing big profit of constructing a new building , people wo n't stop building until we are run out of space .
And that day will come sometime in twenty years .
Since there is only scared space , less cars will be on streets because there is no room for them !
People will rather walk within short distance than drive cars .
It is also to avoid traffic jam .

Since public area is too limited , public transportation such as bus and subway will replace private owned cars .
With the growth of technology , buses in twenty years will be high-tech and of good quality .
People will enjoy riding on bus more than we do today .
Choosing public transportation is also a way to save our endangering natural energies .

Most importantly , government will play a profound role in regulating the number of cars .
As I stated , there is less and less space and energy in our globe ; thus , government of countries all over the world will take actions to reduce the number of cars .
For example , increasing import tax can lead to a decline in car demand .
Also , government would awards family for not driving car but taking buses to encourage others not to drive .
Those actions may not benefit motor market , but will certainly help making a better environment .

The global village is where everyone lives and has responsibility to protect .
To make a better home for everyone , cars will be sacrificed .
Thus , there will be less cars .
