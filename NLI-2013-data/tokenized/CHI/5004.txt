Do advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ?
Some people think that they indeed have the positive influence to make them much better ; others have diverse opinions .
To me , I agree that most advertisements make products better than they really are .
There are three points presented as follows :

The major function of advertisements is to attract consumers ' attention .
For example , some shampoo companies mention that their product is the best among others by showing the positive results from their cosumers ' surveys .
By doing so , the cosumers might purchace this product by this persuasive evidence .

In addition , some advertisements create certain interesting slogans which diffuse to peoples ' daily life .
The public might be influence by the slogans and start to mention it on a daily basis .
By diong so , the reputation of the product will be increased , and people might not be awared of it .
Although people get to know this product and maybe to purchase it to see if it really works , this trend seems to make the product better than they really are .

The last but not the least , most of advertisements are made to intrigue cosumers to buy the products .
How to make people notice this product is the main intention of the advertisements .
In order to let the public gets to know the product , some companies even invite a celebrity to show off in their advertisement .
Some fans of that celebrity might be interested in buying the product due to this factor .

In summary , it is very useful strategy of using advertisement to attract peoples ' attention to certain product .
Advertisements indeed make products seem much better than they really are due to the previous reasons .
