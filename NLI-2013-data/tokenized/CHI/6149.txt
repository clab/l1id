Some people believe that the number of the cars will decrease , while others do not think so .
In my opinion , the total amounts of the cars will diminish largely because the people gradually realize that too many cars will cause serious problems .

The first reason for my viewpoint lies in the fact that nowadays more and more importance and attentions have been attached to the problems cause by cars .
For example , the cars caused the serious environmental problems like the air and water pollution .
Moreover , the cars cause too much noise which largely affect our sleeping and study .
In addition , the increasing cars have used a relativley high rate of the precious oil on which our quotidian life and industry development depend .
These detrimental problems brought about by the cars , if not handled in time properly , will lead to a series of severe consequences .

Luckly , we have seen a lot of endeavors and efforts to solve the problems of cars by both the government and public .
For instance , the government has offered enough financial support for a lot of scientists to invent new vechiles .
What 's more , the media like the newspapers are trying their best to call for the public and the students to ride the buses to go to work .
These efforts may be effective to decrease importance of the cars and reduce the total amounts of the cars in the future .

Of course , we should not ignore or underestimate the difficulties involved in the reducing the numbers of cars .
The cars is one of the most effective and convinent way of trip .
Many people want to purchase a car because they want to work or go anywhere anytime .
They will not be restricted by many outside factors .
They may think the car as the status of the themselves in the society and do not take into account the cars in a pratical way .

All in all , the issue about the cars is the a complex one that needs the analysis on the case-by-case basis , accordingly all three reasons mentioned above intertwine to form a whole organic becoming more persuasive that any of them .
In the final analysis , though the danger of cars call more attentions increasingly , it is also important for us to change the feeling of the cars in the public ' mind to reduce the nuymbers of the cars .
