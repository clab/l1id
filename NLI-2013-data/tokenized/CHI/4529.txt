Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This selling techinque is used to attract customers .
The advertisements mostly over-emphasis the multi-functions , the graurantee refund policy , and the prices of the products .

Most of the products are stated that they have more than one funtion .
For example , there are multi-functions of the most Chinese herbal tea .
If you drink such kind of tea , more than one type of diseases , such as headaches , stomach hurt , heart burn , and even fat burning , you can be healed .
However , most of the products from the advertisements do not state clearly how long the proclaimed effects will be work ed out when you buy the product .

Besides , most advertisemets emphasize that there is a hundred percentage of confidence for the refund policy .
If you are not satisfied with the product after you purchase it , you will get back all your money when you send back the product to the company .
However , such kind of policy has limited return time an specific condition .
For example , if you want to return a bottle of moisturising cream , you will have hundred percentage refunds only within a week of purchasing , and not more than one-third of the cream is used ; otherwise , you are not eligibled to make such kind of claim .

Moreover , the price of the product you seem in the advertisements is much cheaper than what you want to buy .
For example , the price of a dress in the advertisement is about 9.99 dollar per item .
However , this price is only for limited items or limited to specific stores , color or size .
As a result , you will pay more than what you espected .
In addition , most of the price listed in the advertisement is not inculded the tax or the shipping fees .
So you will paid higher prize for the product , rather than it is listed in the advertisements .

So we have to check all the details about the products we want to buy .
Do not believe what you see from the advertisements totally .
We have to become a smart customer .
