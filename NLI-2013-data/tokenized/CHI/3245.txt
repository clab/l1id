Some people considered that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I disagree with the sataements .
Although it seems to be a sound satement , but I think it is a sweeping generalization by the following reasons .

First of all , we should focus the problems only on young people .
By the accelerating of the modern city life , speed makes us hard to know about people living in the samecommunity with us .
Young people may have responsibilities to help their communities , but we should not only asked them to do it .
All the people in the same communities should try to help it .

Secondly , how many time should we ask them to pay for these communities ?
More time spending means more improvment of thse communities ?
Today we can do some contributions to our communites services though internet .
Maybe we should try to set a system that can work on the area of communities services in tweenty four hours .

Finally , the difinition of commmunities are much unclear .
There are a lot of virtual communities in the world of internet .
Do they help people ?
Yes , they did held peolple .
We should not ristrict the ranges of helping the scieoty .
May be it is better to let different groups help each other .

In conclution , I fully disagree the satement that young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their communities , and thses are the reasons why .
