It is a controversal problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not .
Differnet people may make different disscions acroding to their backgroud .
Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music .
But acroding to my own personality and backgroud , I can not agree with them .
I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Reasons and evidences are listed as following .

The world now , unlike 100 years before , needs man who only know one subject .
It needs people can have a broad knowledge .
For example , the engineers now ont only need to know about engineering , but also need to have the ablity to use computer .
Because most of their works are completed on the computers .
So if he is only a specialist about engineering , he will not finish his work prefectly .

Forthemore , Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choose for the future .
It is hard to say that a student majors engineering will become an engineer after his graduation .
It is common to see students in college change their majors .
But a man only good at one subjuect will not have the free to do so .

As the most morden buildings are the mixture of music and painting .
A specialist is the man who soecializes in more than one subject .
The famous English detecter in the noverl are good at detective and music .
Such examples can be seen during every day life .

A man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so .
Though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing .
But I think a capable man can benifit from his wide interest , for his interest will finally help his to do achieve in his major
