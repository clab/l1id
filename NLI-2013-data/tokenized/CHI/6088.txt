Some people prefer to deem that fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years , and others believe that it would be not true .
Newadays some may hold the opinion that we should limited the quantity of the cars , but others have a negative attitude .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with that thinking of limited the cars quantity is a good choice .
My arguments for this point are listed as follow .

Firstly , In the modern soceity , we can easily to consider the traffic jam is become the most significant problem that embrassed us .
For example , every day I go back home by taking bus , I must to spent one hour , however actually the distance so closed .
Why ?
The reason is clear , because of the traffic jam .
This is a example not rare , more examples have showed about how horrible the traffic jam was .
now if we decide to go to some place , we must to account how much time we should prepare to stay in the road , and make sure we will not delay our schedule .
I saw numerous situations about how people delay an important meeting or lost the oppotunity of job .

Secondly , Our city was a very beautiful city in the past , but after the advanced of people 's life , the more people have the cars , the more air pollution was happend , now I could not see the blue sky and smell the fresh air .
According a recent survey , the research shows that the pollution of air quality has been added more than twenty percent more than last year .
May be after in ten years , we will be not able to know the sky color is blue .

However , the goverment already set some methods to limited the pollution by car and make our traffic become more flexible , Though decrease the numeber of the cars and prevent some large cars with pollution gas driving in the city , furthermore , to convinced us do not buy the private car instead to take the bus or subway .

From what has been discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars id use than there are today .
