At the begining of 19th centry , the fisrt advertisement appeared in the public life .
In fact , certain goods are meant to described as much better than they really are .
However , in my personal opinion , I believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the AD makers are over promoting their goods .

First of all , human beings are the animal that full of desires .
We want ourselves to be respected and popular among others , so we usually willing to pay to help us make that target .
For example , most of us using shampoo to wash our hair everyday , and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner .
Yet , is that true ?
Is there any science datas ever prove that shampoo can clean up our hair ?
Look at the TV shows , magazines and internet again , there are still full of sixy women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos .
As soon as we believe tthose advertisements , and presuated by them , we will go stright to spend money on buying their goods .
And at most of time without even a reason .

Also , if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge AD of a sport star wearing a pair of NIke sport shoes and looks so happy and cool , wo n't you strat to have a idea of `` Wow , that shoes look so good '' ?
Even so , is the truth truning out as a pair of NIke shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier ?
Easy enought , the answer is no .

Actully , it is not the game of advertisements make most of prodeucts seem better , but persaute you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them .
Such as the shampoo and the pretty , sixty girls with their good looking hair , and the sport shoes plus the cool looking sports starts .

Therefore next time , if you see another great-looking product advertisement that make you own the desire of buying , think twice about are those goods really that good , or just yourself is simply thinking that way .
