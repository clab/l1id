As we have known , every coin has two sides , and different people have disparate answear to the same qwuestion .
Sometimes it is a dilemma to say whether successful people try new things and take risks rrther than only doing what they already know how to do well .
As far as I am concerned , I agree that successful people usually try new things and take risks .
I will point out sepecificate reasons as follow :

The main reason I advocate is that the new things and risks promote people work hard .
There is no deny that the new things and risks contains a lot of challenge , we do not know what will happen , what we will face , what result is , as if when we climd a mountain , we do not whether there are huge animals waiting fo us .
This condition inspire us be more carefull , more hard , whithout any careless .

What is worth noticing fact that when we try new things and take risks , we will get more experience .
Because the stuff is new and fresh to us , we have no experience to solve it .
As a result , we have to search new way to settle it according to the knowalage we have learned before , then gather the information to solve it one step by one step .
After this process , we get the new experience .
If we just do the things we already know howw to do well , we only have the way to solve this problem .
Successful carry ot a new way to settle question , this is the reason why they are successful

The future reason I state is that successful people are particular group in the society .
How to be successful people .
Not only do everything well , but also can give suggestion to other people .
Maybe other people can also doo the things well which we have know how to do it , but may can not try new thing or be afraid od taking risks .
Only brave man can be called successful .

To be fair , I must own up to the advantage of doing things what people have known how to do it , such as saving a lot of time , more steady .
But based on the reasons I have mentioned above , I agree that the successful people are who always try new thing and take risks .
