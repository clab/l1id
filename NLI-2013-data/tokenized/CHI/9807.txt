First , to be sucess , one should be at least in the five percent top in the domain he works .

More competitors in the domaine , more difficult to be success .
Want to be success , create

Second , always repeating the same work , satifying with the recent life , not being willing to take the challenger , all these are not the characteristics of the successful people .
If you want to be success , you have to surmount the achivement you have got , you must get higher and higher .
When you chose a new thing which nobody else had tried , this is the challenger and this will cause the risk .
