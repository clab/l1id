It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I agree the following statement .
I think it is important for people to know the broad knowledge .
Because there are too many thteresting things for us to find out , we can not live without them .
And we should the each kind of the academic subjects which is fun and interesting .
It can let us unearth the myserious situations and conditions , and what the reason is .
Moreover , it also is a kind of bridge of communication which opens the minds of others .

First of all , the broad knowledge is interesting to me .
I am interested in English , Chinese , Math , Physics , and Chemistry .
In my opion , all of them are very appealing to me .
And I also would spend the great time learning and studying them .
All the academic subjects are vital to me because it would become my power and ability .
When I encounter the problems , I can use them to risk the problems .

Secondly , there a lot of the unknown situations and the natural environments which humans never find out .
Therefore , I hope I can find out the reason for the undiscoverary situaions occurred .
Moreover , I hope I can become a great scientist that is full of wisdom .

Finally , it sometimes is a bridge communciation between the unfamilar people .
If you have the same kind of knowlede , you can start to talk with them and be more familar .
We can also have no gaps with other people because we have the same ideas and thoughts .

To sum up , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
We can be a really man who know a lot and can communicate with other easily .
