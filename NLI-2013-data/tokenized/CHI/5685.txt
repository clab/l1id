In fact , I do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
What is the reason to support my point ?
In the point of the company , the purpose of advertisements is to promote their products .
Of course they will advertise their products perfect to attract more customers to purchase them .
Only in that way , they could gain more benifit to their company .
So here comes the trickness .
Instead of telling the weakness of thier products to the customers , the company just repeats the goodness of them .
After all , the expence of the advertisements and marketing is extremely high .
For instance , the cost of advertisement in TV is charged per second .
In order to reach the best profit , absolutely they must make the products the best .
Therefore , it would not hard to understand that why products seem so wonderful in the advertisement .

In other way , customers chose what they are going to buy by the introduction of advertisement .
As what we mentions about the company 's concern , it is a huge difference between what customer needs and what company wants !

So what is the best way for both customers and companies ?
It would be better if customers could check the detailed more deeply before buying the products and the company should tell us more during theadvitisement
