I disagree with that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Many country is developping rapidly now .
Just like China and India .
These two country were not so superior in ecnormics before , but they are developping now .
there is a big population in both of the two country .
As the country developped , they would be manufact a large number of cars for transport or for the citizen 's use .
As we all know , China is the biggest bike using country in the world .
But now , more and more Chinese became to buy cars instead of bikes .
Of course so do the people in India .
People need cars when they want to go to the place not so near to them .

And I do n't think the people in well-developped country , just like USA and Japan , will stopping using cars .
People feel inconvenient when they lost something they are used to use .
Espectially in usa , the USA is so wide that people live in there ca n't leave from cars .

The car companies are trying to make light cars which consume less gasoline to antipolution .
But none of them stops producing cars .
They know cars are greatly needed by people over the world .

Maybe you will say that people can take the metros or buses .
They are also very convneient .
That is ture .
And people also can take them in rush hours .
But what about weekends ?
When we want to go out for a picnic with our family , do you think it is better to take metro than drive the car yoursevles ?
Of course not !
Everybody need the space of himself .
So a car is necessary to every family .
We can take a metro to go to the workplace , but we ca n't bear do the same thing when we get along with our families or lovers .

So everybody of us needs car .
there wo n't be fewer cars in use than there are today i think .
