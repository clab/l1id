I agree .
Young people sould spend more time to help their communities .
In this essay , I would like to present my ideas about young people nowadays should spend more time to help their commnities .

Before arguing about this issue , the definition of `` enough '' should be stated .
How much work is enough ?
I believe the answer should not be some actual number but a right attitude or a correct worthvalue of helping others .
Young people should undertand the meaning of society , the neccessity of society for human psychology and acutal needs , and how societies are constructed .
Once this attitude is aquired , then it would be `` enough . ''

In past fifty years , individualizm is emphasized in most cultures .
Consequently , young people nowadays only care about themselves .
Their parents do not teach them to help others actively .
The schools they go do not ask them to pay attention to the people in need .
Even the government spends little money on the charity agency .
Could one imagine what kind of soiciety wil we live in when young people nowadays become the leaders of our planet ?
Thus , a heart to care about others is very important .
Individualizm should not be understood as isolation from people .
Instead , it should be every one can have the ability to work individually , but also to work with others to create a better environment or society .

In these two decades , some leaders of a business start to promote `` the spirit of team work . ''
This shows that more and more people realize the importance of working as a team , in other words , as a community .
Each one of us is a tiny little part of a bigger unit , like a family .
Many families construct a comminity .
Many communities builds up a country .
A country is simply a bigger community .
To learn how to be responsible to one 's country , one should learn how to be responsible to their commnity .

In conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their commnities .
They should spend more time to help others .
It starts with developing right worthvalue and right attitude .
