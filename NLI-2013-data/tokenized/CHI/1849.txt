With the development of society , there are increasing choices to enjoy life as people can play computer games , chat on line , or go to see a live performance etc .
Although these all seem to be what only young people can do as they accept new inventions and opinions more quickly and have more energy to enjoy , it is a little bit haste to assert that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Does young people really have more time and energy to enjoy life ?
As the pace of modern society fastens , young people who have already had a job face the pressure from their bosses , family members and other people , worrying about not getting promoted without recommendation , being troubled by a tiny mistake during the work and therefore making great efforts to work in the hope of completing their tasks perfectly .
As a result , they always keep in a hurry to get things done and seldom have energy to enjoy their life .
What 's more , for the young people who are still college students , the fierce competion when hunting a job also drives them to study hard and develop many kinds of skills .
For example , in the college I am studying in , most of students are striving to get certificates in business English and computer skills and taking a lot of courses such as communication skills , which may be helpful in future career .
In contrast , as older people do n't have to face all the challenges , risks and difficult choices , they tend to have a more peaceful mind and enjoy life more than young people .

Some people also argue that the modern technology such as computer skills used in many methods to relax makes it hard for older people to enjoy .
In fact , many old people have been accustomed to taking adavantage of these innovations .
For example , my grandfather who is 60 years old have been good at chatting on line and downloading movies and music from Internet just like a young person .
And also , old people can enjoy life in different ways without technology .
They can take a walk and take exercises in a park , or listen to music sitting in a chair , and for some of them , looking at grandchildren being around is a kind of relaxation .
