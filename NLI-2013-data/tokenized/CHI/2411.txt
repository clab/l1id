Life is like a virgin forest , with primitive mountains , rivers , grassland and flowers in it .
You cannot pick a peak out of it without exploring or probing the true face of it .
So does age .
Different age-experiences enable us to interprete the codes of life , the different primes in life , the dynamic enjoyments by walking through life .
Hence , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe different age groups can experience the identical happiness or joy by appreciating the different beauty inside of their life .

First of all , it is believed that all ages have its prime .
20s means smartness and quickness , 30s encountering diligence and perseverence , while 60s sounds sophistication and wisdom .
They just focus on different strength .
It does not deny or differ their enjoyment in life .
Many Nobel Prize winners who achieved their biggest professional peak , enjoy the happiness of it when they are wellknown and prestigious in their later years .
They had a particularly hard time in proving their hyposis or theory in their youth , like Albert Einstein , Nikola Tesla .

Secondly , happiness is a lifetime pursuit .
People through all age bracket seek for the real joy of life .
Many sayings tell us the happiness does not discriminate ages .
A wise , intelligent novel or person can win high praise despite of the age of the author .

Furthermore , many people think the life is too short to waste .
So , during their youth , most of their endeavors contribute their career , family and friendship .
While , retired people can enjoy their interest , develop their skills since they got more free time .
Can we say that only young people enjoy a better life than older one .

In conclusion , I support the idea that all ages deserve the right to be happy as long as they explore the beautiful colors of each age and pursue the real value of each age bracket .
That is the color of life .
