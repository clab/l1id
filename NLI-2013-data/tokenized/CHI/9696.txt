Some people may think that successful people always try new things and take risks .
Others may think that those people will only focus on what they already know how to do well .
I believe that successful people will only do what they are already skilled .
It is because they know the reason why they are successful is because no one can replace their specialities .
Moreover , doing what they are skilled can prevent them from being lose .

That a person has a job that no one can replace his or her position is a very important factor for a successful person .
My father always told me that I have to find my interesting , and become very skilled in that field .
I totally believe those words because a successful person knows his interesting and keep studying it until he knows a lot about his interesting .
Take my professor for example , she is very good at translation .
Thus , when some of the faculty members want to translate their books into English , they all ask my professor for help .
They wo n't think about others .
My professor can earn a lot money by doing translation .
Therefore , successful people will only do what they already know how to do because they know no one can replace them .

Moreover , a successful person is successful because he do anything to prevent him from being fail .
Can a successful person still success when he is failed ?
I do n't think so .
For example , there was a once well-known company in my country .
They were famous because they could produce nicely-look comuters .
Every body liked to use their computer .
However , their boss decided to take a risk to make some LCD monitor five years ago .
The money they spent on making new LCD monitor is the money they not used on improving their computer quality .
As a result , they were failed on both computers and LCD monitors .
Did the company success ?

Thus , successful people will do what they are already skilled .
They know no one can replace them and they wo n't take risks to prevent them from being loss .
