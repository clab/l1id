The author says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , i prefer travel alone than travel with a group of people .
The reasons are talked below .

firstly , the target of my travelling is relax .
I would not like to plan it typically and would like to go somewhere i really like .
If i can choice i will stay in one place for enough time .
After hard work , people want to relax themselves and do not like to obey the schedules .
For example , when you asked one whether he or she would like to plan their leisure time .
Many of them will say no and give the answer to stop telephone going somewhere one like , no guide , no many people , quiet , really relax .
People do not like to bring schedule in leisure time .
Because the hard day Secondly , travel alone is a popular method in the world and people can explore new places than the old ones .
We really like go to new places than the old places .
But travel with group do not meet the need .
People like adventures .
For example , in china there are many famous places just like the Great wall and the Summer palance .
If somebody choose the group to travel the famous places , he or she will disapointed because there are so many people in the Great wall that one can not have a good look at it .
On the other hand , when one walk alone and choose the best days , he or she will please themselves with the great picture of the nature .

Thirdly , the tour guide is somewhat troublesome .
He or she alway lead the group of people to the shopping mall buying many things that the tour people do not really want .
The exactly time of the visiting is short and one can not have pleasure with the visiting .
It is a questions that someone travel with group can meet .
And many people do not like .

Last but not the least , there are many benefits about travelling with group by a tour guide .
Such as safety , saving time , well planned .
It is a common choice for many people and also a traditions for much family .

In sum , in my point of view , i like go somewhere myself and enjoy the place i have never gone .
I would like some place that there are not so much people and really relax from the study and work .
Enjoying the happy life .
