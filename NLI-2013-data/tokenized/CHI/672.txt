From my point of view , I agree with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject only .
I will explain it from three aspects , personal interest , personal development and vanishing subject .

Firstly , not much students can realize their interest that which subject they like most .
Many of them , including me would get frustrated when we should make a choice among thousands of subjects to study in university .
However , if we no need to choose a specific one to concentrate on , we can expose to different kinds of subjects and hence develop our interest .
It is really regrettable if we make a wrong decision is choosing it .

Secondly , broad education can nurture students to be an all-rounder .
All companies demand all-rounders instead of students with specific knowledge .
Of course , everyone should have his/her strengths and weaknesses .
However , broad education allows students to develop more comprehensively .
For example , the art students may be weak in communication skills or the science students may be too rational .
But if all students are put together and study more subjects , a student 's personality may have influence on the others besides gaining other subjects ' knowledge .

Last but not least , it prevents some subjects to be vanished or even disappeared .
Sometimes , students choose subjects that have good future career such as business .
Few people would choose subjects just based on interest .
Therefore , this leaves some subjects like Chinese history to become vanished .
But Chinese history actually is worth studying and important for young people to familar .
At this point , if we set broad knowledge is a must , the problem wo n't happen .

In conclusion , studying in many subjects is better than specialize in one as it allows students to develop more interest , to become all-rounded that can benefit their future career and also prevent some subjects from vanishing .
