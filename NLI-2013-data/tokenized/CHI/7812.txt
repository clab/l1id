I think travel in a group led bay a tour guide is the best way The tour guide is a good assitance of tourists .
Because , during the trip the places are strange to those visitor they do not have any ideal about the place they are in .
Everytime when people go on a trip in the new area , always get the tour guide .
The tour guide konws the detail of the area where they in .
It mainly include : the induction of the area you are travelling , the map of the area , the landmark of famous scence of view , even the hospital , police station , hotel , and so on .
Follow the tour guide , the tourists can do a quiete perfect travel plane , find out the most beautiful or most desirable place easily , chose the fastest traffic to get there , these or saves time and money .
And the places chosen by the tour guide are all valuable , which are the places the visitor must go .
If the tourists without the guide they may miss the good view or funny case .

And when the tourists traveled in group it easier to organize some funny activities .
Like a party near the beach .
The more people the more happy atmosphere .
During the trip the tourists can make friend with each other , even a starting of love .
It is kind of good communication between people especially for those people in the city , buzy with their work all day .

But something sad is that recently , the tour guide becomes a commercial pormotion gradually .
Like , the guide cheat the visitor with the local shop onwer , this kind of issue always happened .
Sometimes the tour guide 's oppinion may not suitable .
Because everyone has their own taste , the place chosen by the tour guide the tourist may not like .
And with in a group it has limitied freedom everyone must act follow the schdule , when the tourist travelling on one , he do not need care others , just go to everywhere he want .

Though it has some short , it still a good chose for tourists
