Young people stand for the future of one society .
It is worthy of discussing what they do when they are free .
Recently there are many reports of younth consumption of luxury purse and cosmetics in Taiwan .
Young people are depicted as egocentric and indifferent to social conditions in such reports .
Is it true that the youth nowadays are no longer embodiment of passion to change the world ?

Examining carefully , there are many examples of enthusiastic young men to help their community .
For instance , a group of sophomore and junior students in Yang Ming Medical College annually visit Yu Li Asylum to support therapists there .
The prepartion begun at least one year earlier .
These future doctors learn not only from textbooks but also from interacting with patients .
They are not satistfied with a knowleage of disease and therapies ; human beings are their ultimate concerns .

Since some young people contribute their leisure to those who are in need , then where does the myth of aloof youth come from in Taiwan ?
I think there might be some reasons behind the prejudice to young people .
Nowadays young people are more daring to express their discontent to social realities than their parents did .
But our society regards these opinions as pure complaint , a symbol of arrogance .
This is the first mistake ,

Although some young people are busy indulging in various kinds of luxures , others are dedicated to improvement of where they live .
It is not fair to deny the effort made by young people tip a tag of laziness .
So I ca n't agree that young people nowadays do n't give enough time for their community .
