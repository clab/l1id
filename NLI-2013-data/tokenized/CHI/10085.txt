Sure it is !
The way how people sucessis they try things in new way !

Peolp create new thing by trying in the way that other people did n't thought about , like the famous man `` Tomas Edsion '' , before him the way people wanted to see things during the night time is to make up the fire on the candle , and the candle sometime coast problem like it maybe can only use in thiry or twenty minites and after that you need to mke anther one , or when you use it and you forget to brought it off , it sometime can be damger for people , so Tomas Edsion see the problem and his find a new way of making light is to use an object that is more safe the candle , but not only more safe than it that Tomas have to figer out a way to make it also more usefull , it is hard to find the right way to create a new thing , but he did it .
