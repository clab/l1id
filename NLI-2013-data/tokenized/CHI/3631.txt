Given a choice between agreeing or disagreeing the young people do not given enough time to helping their communities .
Many people maybe agree this topic .
However , I was totally disagree on this topic , and I have three points on it .
Young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do , Communities was the person who live there and not only young people should care .

Firstly , young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like .
For a example , young people play with their friends and they also know about where to play and which was the best time or place .
They care about their communities , if there is no play give them play .
They not only make friends , but also can help communities .

Secondly , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do .
For a instance , everyday we go to school , we might see our communities what happens ?
or what interests ?
If in communities who need to our help that we can call neighborhood to help them .
It 's not cost a lot of time for us to help our communities .

Finially , communities was the person who live there , not only young people should care .
For a example , old people , young people and childrens are all living in this communities .
If Some one need a help , not only young can help this person , old people also can help them with this time .
It ' s kind of experience question on it .

In a word , I was disagree on this the young people do not given enough time to helping their communities , Because of young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do and communities was the person who live there , not only young people should care .
