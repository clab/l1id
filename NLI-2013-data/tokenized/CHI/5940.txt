Car was among the most significant inventions in the 20th century .
it has greatly improved transportation and brought tremendous convenience to our lives .
However , today , some people start to believe that car usage is going to decline in the near future .
Nonsensical ?
Not really .
I do agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
I will now explain my points .

First , twenty years later , it is very likely that other means of transpotation , such as aeroplanes and trains , will take over cars .
Today , travelling by air is already getting cheaper and faster .
With all the budget airlines emerging and the major air companies expanding their routs , air transportation system is going to get more established and more convenient .
The same is happening to train transporation sector .
Therefore , when this phenomenon continues to take place , cars will soon lose their popularity , especially when coupled with the next problem .

Most people may also stop driving as the cost of driving continue to increase .
By cost of driving , I am chiefly refering to the cost of petrol .
Petrol price is constantly on its rise today .
Twenty years later , petrol price may become so high that many people may not be able to afford using a car .
Hence , with many substitutes available , such as air-traveling and train-traveling , it is logical to expect a decline in car usage twenty years down the road .

Last but not least , people are getting more and more environmentally conscious today .
This consciousness is expected to discourage car usage in the future , so as to reduce air and noise pollution that most big cities are experiencing now .
People may switch to public transports for travelling within the city .
Some people may even choose to cycle instead of driving .
In other words , as people get more educated and concern about the environment more , one can expect the see less cars in the future .

In essence , cars may once be the favorite of Man in terms of traveling , but reality shows that this may not be the case soon .
