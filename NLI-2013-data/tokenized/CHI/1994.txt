SOME YOUNG PEOPLE DO ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO .
BUT THAT IS NOT 100 PERCENT CORRECT .
SOME OF OLDER PEOPLE THEY WORKED SO HARD DURING THE YOUNG LIFE , THEY SPEND ALMOST MORE THAN 12 HOURS FOR WORK JUST WANT SAVE MORE MONEY FOR THE FUTURE OLD LIFE .
THEY MIGHT PLAY AFTER RETIRED CAN AROUND THE WORLD USE THIS MONEY .

MY FATHER WAS CRAZY OF WORK WHEN HE WAS YOUNG .
HE WORKS ALMOST OVER 12 HOURS .
HE GOT BACK HOME USUALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT FOR EVERYDAY .
I EVEN DID NOT HAVE CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM .
NOW HE IS RETIRED HE TOOK MY MOM TRAVEL A LOT OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES .
MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE JELOUS OF THEM .
IN CHINA , OLD PEOPLE SAID `` IF YOU NOT WORK SO HARD WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG , YOU WILL GET REGRATED . ''

MY PARENTS ALWAYS TOLD ME `` YOU HAVE TO MORK HARDER WHEN YOU HAVE ENERGE BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE . ''
BUT THIS WORDS NOW IS CHANGE TO UES IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE .

NOWADAYS SOME YOUNG PEOPLE JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN IN THIS WORLD .
THEY WEST TIME AND MONEY IN PLAYING AND DOING NOTHING .
WHEN THEY HAVE NO MONEY THEY ASK THEIR PARENTS TO GET .
IF YOU ASK THEM WHY DO NOT YOU WORK ?
THEY WILL TELL YOU `` LIFE IS SHORT , YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN FOR TOMORROW SO JUST ENJOY YOUR LIFE DO NOT BE SO SERIOUS AND DO NOT NEED TO WORK SO HARD . ''
MY FATHER 'S CO-WORKER HAS A SON .
HE DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL HE JUST STAY AT HOME AND PLAYING COMPUTRT GAME UNTIL NOW HE IS 27 YEARS OLD .
HE NEVER WORK .
THE RESION IS HE THINK HIS FAMILY DO NOT NEED TO WORK TO MAKE MONEY SO HE RATHER STAY AT HOME ENJOY HIS COMPUTER GAME LIFE .
IT IS NOT CALLED ENJOY LIFE .
I THINK SOME OF THEM CALLED ENJOY LIFE JUST GET LAZY , THEY DO NOT WANT THEMSELVES SO TIRED .

I CAN NOT SAY YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE THAT IS DEPENDS ON THE PERSON , JUST DO NOT WEST THE TIME TO DOING NOTHING .
TIME IS MONEY .
