Will there be fewer cars on road twenty years later than there are today ?
This is complex and controversial question .
But in my opinion , I do agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
My opinion will be proved by following discussion .

First of all , the traffic jam .
Traffic jam already became a serious problem in any large cities in the world .
For example , Shanghai , It will take you 2 hours to go 3 miles during the peak time .
Government tried to build more roads but still can not meet the requirement .
The solution is the rail way transportation system .
This is also the solution for many other cities in the world .
Take subway , you can control the time accurately and will not waste your time on road .
If more and more people take the public transportation system such as subway , there will less cars on road .

Secondly , the environment protection .
More and more people and governments in this world already awared that protect our environment is protecting our selves .
Also , more and more people select other transportation systems such as bicycle , electrical powered trains and solar powered systems instead of a car .
People is choosing not to use cars as possible as they could .
This trend means that there will be less cars on road in future than there are today .

Third , resource shortage and government policy .
As we know that the price of the oil always keep going up recently .
This is because the oil has already became the shortage resource .
If the price continue going up , less people could affort the consumption of oil and will stop use the car .
Also , to solve the traffic jam problem and resource shortage problem , the governments will issue different kind of policies to limited the use of car .
For example , raise the tax of car and oil , or raise the car license fee which already selected by Shanghai government few years ago .
People have to pay extra money to support a car in future .
This will force a lot of people not to use the car .

In the end , base on above mentioned reasons , we could draw the conclusion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
