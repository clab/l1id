Some people aclaim that they prefer to travel alone , while others oppsite it .
Despite assorted opinions to the contrast , as for me , I would not hesitate to agree that travelling alone is the best the way to travel .
There are some reasons as follows .

To begin with , travelling alone is free .
We can go anywhere we want and have no need to listen the guides ' requirement .
However , If we are in a group led by a tour guide , we have to comply with the guides ' .
It entirely possible that there are some places we do not like to stay long but the guide still take us to go .
Then we will feel unhappy .
There is no doubt that our purpose for travelling is releave stress and entertain our life .
However , it makes us feel more annoy .
Then why should we go with a guide ?

Besides , in nowadays some guides like to take the visitors to the place which are not really interesting place but shops to let us buy a myriad things which are so-called `` memorary gift '' .
It not only wastes lots of money but also make us feel boring about the tour .
To illustrate it , there is a persuasive example .
last year , Jane went to Lushan in Xian Province with a lot of people , which is her first time to go there .
She thought it would be an indelible experience .
However , after she got there , the guide did not take them to climbe the mountaon instead of asking them to buy some photoes first .
And them he also take them to a shop nearby and make them consume many things for the reason that they can symbol that they had been to Lushan .

Admittedly , travelling alone is dangerous to some degree .
However , it is obvious that it instrmental rather than detrimental to us .
Therefore , with thoroughly considerating , I can draw that I would incline to travel by my own .
