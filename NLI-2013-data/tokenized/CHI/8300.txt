Nowadays , there are numorous debats on whether or not understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .
From my point of view , I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The following reasons will support my opinion from three perspectives .

First of all , ideas and concepts are the foundation of the facts .
In addition , in the most textbooks , every chapter begins with the terms and definitions of the ideas and concepts .
At the begining of every chapter the professor will ask students to understand every terms and ideas which is included in this chapter .
Because every subjects have some speical terms the students did not hear before .
If they do not understand these ideas and concepts , they will have a lot of difficulties to learn the facts about these ideas .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts more effiectively and efficiently .
When the students understand and memorize all the ideas and concepts which they are going to learn about , they are get ready to accept the new facts related to these ideas .
Forthermore , they will familiar to these facts by the means of they understand ideas and concepts .
All of these will help students to learn the facts quickly and correctly .

Thirdly , students learning facts indicate to memorize the concepts correctly and accurately .
In the school , the first objection of students are learning the academic knowlege which refers to the ideas and concepts .
Later , they will use these knowlege in the working place and connect the ideas with the facts .
Therefore , in the school students should concentrate on the ideas and concepts , meanwhile , they can use the facts to help them memorize the ideas and concepts accurately .

To conclude , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
Firstly , the facts is based on the ideas and concepts .
Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts is a good way for students to learn the facts .
Lastly , learing ideas and concepts will more beneficial for students achieving their academica goal .
Therefore , students should make a great effort to understand the ideas and concepts , then to learn facts .
