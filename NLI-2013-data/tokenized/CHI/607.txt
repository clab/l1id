When it comes to whether one should have broad knowledge or just specialize in one specific subject , different people have different opinions .
While broad knowledge usually equipts a person to become a generalist , focused and deep knowledge can turn a person into a specialist .
Both ways have advantages and disadvantages , but as far as I am concerned , I think it 's better to specialize in a certain area .

As we have entered the information era , large flows of information has come into our life , and many new subjects have appeared .
Unlike ancient people , who could only deal with simple subjects like astronomy , math and philosophy , modern people have too much knowledge to deal with .
It 's quite unrealistic for people nowadays to learn everything that is accessible .
Every subject has its own knowledge system , and every system has its specific development and application .
Time wo n't allow us to dig into every subject .
If anyone wants to study every subject , he will end with learning nothing .

Moreover , it would be more beneficial for us to specialize in certain areas .
For one thing , we can devote our full energy and effort into that area which could ensure a better gain out of it .
For another thing , to be an expert in one area can be truly useful for the society .
For example , many scientists are focusing their attention to the research in their specific area , and due to their focus and devotion , we can enjoy so many achievements in the science .
Another example is many professions give high respect and credit to those experts , such as doctors and teachers .
Because of their experience and devotions , the society can benefit from their accumulating contributions .

However , to specialize in one area does n't mean knowing nothing about knowledge in other areas .
While schools require students to choose a specific major , they also should provide chances for students to get in touch with other areas .
For example , an engineering student can focus on his or her major study , at the same time , he or she can also have arts or history as optional courses .
It 's vital for students to have a broad view about the world .

In conclusion , all the points I have discussed above have proved that to specialize in one area is better for students .
