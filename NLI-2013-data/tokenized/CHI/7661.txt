Due to the convenience of the transportation tools nowaday , people have more chances to travel to a different place or country which teny do n't live in .
There are several ways of travelling .
You may plan a trip by yourself or led by a tour guide .
It is hard to determine which way is better since it depends on the place you want to travel and the budget you have .

The most obvious adventage of travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the less transportation and living charge .
You can book the flight ticket and hotel room with speciall discount because of more quantity of people .
This is a very attractive reason to those people who do n't have enough budget but still want to relax after a log hard work period .
Furthermore , you do n't need to worry about which place should be worth to be visited with a touring guide in an infamiliar country beacuse the guide will summarize all visting sites for you in your trip .
You definitely wo n't get lost in a city once if you have a tour guide .

However , you may not have the oppertunity to know a city or country in advance if you join a travelling group with a tour guide .
The tour guide can lead the group when travelling but that means , in the same time you probably ca n't go to some other places which are not in the schedule you personally want to visit .
You have to compromise with other parterners in the group and miss several sights you want so that everybody can travel to the same direction together .
For the person who really want to explore a city , the travelling group is not able to satisfy his requirement .

From the above arguments of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , there are still several disadvantages of this travelling type .
Therefore , I do not agrre with the statement : `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
