What are students going to school for ?
Do they learn the thing that are nescessary for them ?
Students are asked to understand ideas and concepts from the subjects they are learning .
They are also asked to learn facts from past experiences .
However , which one is the thing they need more , understanding ideas or learning facts ?
In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students .

To begin with , students go to school because they need to gain knowledge that are needed for their future .
Student should be able to understand that the ideas and concepts of the subjects they are studying , so that they will understand the subjects easier .
For example , the use of a mathematical formula , the rule of a chemical equation .
Without the understanding the ideas and concept , they do not know how to use it and when should they apply it on .

As being a student , I think that when student have the ideas and concepts of something , they will eventually understand the facts of something too .
Since a fact of an event or object is actually the result of the development of a centain kind of ideas and concepts .
In the other word , ideas and concept are the basic requirement for student to learn a facts .

Moveover , some people think that learning facts is more improtant for students than understand ideas and concepts .
It is because they believe that facts is more easier for students to understand something nesscessary for thier life .
But their never understand that facts can only tell use the surface of somethings , not the meaning that are behind them .

In conclusion , it is improtant for students to know both the ideas and concepts and facts of what they are learning .
However , ideas and concepts are the basic elements for them the study a subject .
Facts may not be able to show the main point they need to know .
As a result , student should focus on the ideas and concepts before they take the next step to learn the facts .
