Young people and old people have different life styles .
As far as I am concerned , young people has more methods of enjoying life than old people .
In the following paragraphs , I will reasoning and provide examples to support my opinion .

Young people are full of energy , which means that besides their study and work , they have much more energy to have fun .
Young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and fun .
At night , the dancing bars are full of young people .
They dance , talk to each other and drink together .
During the holidays , young people drive to the mountain or the sea shore for hunting , canoeing or hiking .
Because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work , they cannot spend as much time as the young people on the holiday travels .
They normally stay at home and watch the TV or chat with their old friends .

Young people have more new methods to enjoy the life because their brains run faster than old people .
Because there are a lot of pressure from the job , young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged .
Young people develop new methods everyday and then spread them all over the world .
They practise new methods of entertainment and discuss them on the network .
On the contrary , old people normally stick to few kinds of entertainment for a long time and do not want to try new methods .

Old people know how to enjoy life and they have their methods of enjoying life .
But comparing with the young people , they spend less time and energy in enjoying the life .

From the above discussions , it is safe to conclude that young people enjoy the life more than older people .
