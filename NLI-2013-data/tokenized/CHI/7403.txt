I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , traveling alone or in an autonomous small group offers more depth and freedom to a trip .
However , traveling with a group and guide also has certain aspects that may appeal to people with different tastes .

Traveling alone or in a small group often means a less rigid and more flexible travel plan .
You are only limited by when the plane/boat/bus arrives or leaves .
Everything else , from where to stay , where to dine , or what sites to visit , can be arranged on the fly or changed on a whim .
For example , a trip to Europe originally meant to see the great castles of the middle ages can easily be changed to an exciting adventure focusing on the modern night clubs of Paris .
In most tour groups , the whole trip is planned out in advance , the hotels booked , the tours arranged .
In my opinion , this lack of freedom means that you are n't able to pursue what interests you most about the place you are traveling in , and instead must conform to what the tour guide chooses as `` worth seeing '' or `` interesting '' .

Another benefit of independent traveling is the possibility of more depth to the whole experience .
As mentioned before , most tour groups have to follow a rigid schedule .
Take the Europe trip for example again ; if you were to come across a beautiful , intricate little chapel in the castle you are visiting , you could stay there for the rest of the day if you wished to , taking in the beauty of the place at leisure .
On the other hand , if you were in a tour group , the only way to appreciate that beautiful chapel would probably be to sacrifice a restroom break in the hopes of snapping a few extra pictures .
Another example would be visiting a museum , if you are going with a guide and group , the experience will be limited to what the guide can show you , often no more than a rushed glance of the most famous works , and then it 's off to the next piece .
However , visiting a museum alone means that you are able to appreciate all the artwork that interests you , without the pressure to leave in time for dinner .

However , it must also be acknowledged that traveling in a group with a guide can have several advantages as well .
Most importantly is that the tour guide is often someone familiar with the local language and customs , which can make arrangements of dining and lodging easier .
Most tour group agencies also have deals with the local hotels and retaurants , which in turn means cheaper deals or better quality accomodations .
For someone who travels to relax , eat good food , and stay at five star hotels , it would be better to go with a group .

In conclusion , I think the best way to travel is not in a group led by a guide , but rather alone or with a small group .
This is because that I treasure freedom and the potential for a deeper experience more than the conveniences of traveling with a group .
