I think it is more important for students to lern facts .
Because if people just understand the idears and they can not use that in our world , that means they do not learn anything .
Everyone if you learn all things the aim is to use that .
so I thing it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

The students go to the school to learn something such as english , math , bology and so on .
They get the perty high gread but when they go out of the school they do not know how to solve the problems thay meaning they never get the knolowdge so they can not use it .
For example I have a friend name 's ning he very like study he thinks study is the first thing in his life , so every night he go to bed after he know everything very cleanly .
He is the favourt student for my teacher , but once we went to the outside to play suddenly one friend have some problem to ask ning , but he can not talk us about the facts , that problem is although a problem .

We are living in the world in the facts we need to know how can we live .
so there is going to be some problem so we go to school to study how to solve the problem .
If you just know the knolowdge and can not solve the true problems in our life the all knolowdge and not be used .
So you just get the skin not the whole thing .

So i think it is more improtant for students to lern facts .
Because we need live in this world !
