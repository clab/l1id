I disagree with the statement that there are fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
The main reason is that most purposes people drive cars are not be replaced .
Generally , people use cars because of their convinence , comfort , and privacy .
The public transportation system such as trains and subways do provide convinent function to people .
It prevents people from parking in the city center , feeling tired after long drive .
However , driving cars provide people a private and comfort room during the period to arrive the place they want to be .
For many people , that is the significant element in their life and the public transportation system does not to seem to get the criteria .
Besides , driving cars make people go anywhere they would like to , highland , moutain , and the ocean .
People can have their own holiday plan , without the restriction of the train station position and worrying about the transfer from station to the places they would like to go .
Even in the developed countries , the governments are not able to budget so much money to locate public transportation to every places people would be .
Compared to that , people can go shopping in many different locations at the same time , also can go to the library just after the class without thinking about the bus schedule .
And in the end , cars will bring more funcions in the future .
People emphysize the lisiure time more and more .
Through the research of the car firms , The cars will not only the traffic instrument , they will provide more functions .
For example , people can cook
