I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
Although vihecles is the most common traffic tools that we use today , but its should be earsed based on following three shortcomings and situations : fossil , pollution and traffic pressure .

As we all know , oil and coal are unrevivable resources .
The coal resources can only be used by two hundred years and the oil resources can even be used by fifty years .
Cars like many other traffic tools are the main consumer of these fossils .
Since we have not enough resources for the vihecle to keep them work forever , there must be a revolution of the traffic tools in near future .
That will give out a new role so as to get rid of the cars from the historic stage .
These should happen in twenty years .

In additon , the pollution problem is another important issue for today .
And the cars are the most monster which caused a lot of air pollution and noise pollution .
The cars works by burning the fossil so that they always pour out so much carbin dioxide and much other poison gas .
Some of them can get together with the water to make acid rain which is the main destroyer of the building and monuments .
Some of the harmful gas causes warm-room effect in the city so that many plants will be dying in this kind of enviorament .
In order to protect our earth , we should project the car !

Resently , traffic jam is also a question to make headache .
This is almost caused by such a great amount of cars we are using .
Much time is wasted in the jam which would not make any value for the society .
If people does n't always drive their own car and take more public traffics , all of them will have more leisure to relax and more chance to make money .
As so many cars are not necessary , why they should exist any more , Even if everybody recognize this point , cars will not keep a long life on the market .

So , as a result , cars will plays more and more little role in our life because of the reasons above .
And they are getting disappeared from now on .
Let 's watch the extinction of the car !
