About the statement , some people may agree that , but others may have negitive attitudes .
As far as I am concerned , I agree that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communutues .
Afterward , I will develop my opinions in sufficient depth and details .

First of all , the transpotations are so convenient and developing today .
People , inculding youngs , go to everywhere so easily , Their appearences are not limited in the communities .
When young people step out the door of houses , they can take buses , taxi , or subways , even drive cars by themselves and go to the place they want to .
They even never pay attention to the communities they live in .
How to talk about helping their communities .

Moreover , the social security today becomes worse and worse .
No one can warrant that it 's always safe in the communities .
It 's possible that the bad bad guys are our neighborhoods .
Besides young people , all people may have no confidence about the communities they live in .
No one is willing to behavior friendly to the communities with no confidence .

Last , there are too many attractive things today for young people , like Internet , pubs , movies , vedio games , etc .
So many funny staffs can be done by young people .
They are too busy having fun on those things to care about the communities they live in .

In a word , I would state my opinion that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities after thoes reasons analyzing above .
