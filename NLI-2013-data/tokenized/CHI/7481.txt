If you want to travel , which way would you perfer to ?
Joining the group in a travel agency by a tour guide or only by yourself ?
When we face the decision of this selecion , some people would deem theat visting the wounderful landscape by themselves since it will be full of myth and exciting .
But for me , to be fank , I agree with attending the group .
Among countless reason which influence the choice , there are 3 conspicuous factors as follows :

The first reason I agree with the statement is that traveling in a group by a helper will afford you more information about the view .
For example , If you are in Hangzhou which city be famous about the West Lake , the tour guide will tell you more about recource you can not get from book or internet .

The second factor can be seen by every person is that the group travelling will bring you more safety .
The guide will tell you which things you can do in the new place according the local 's custom , how to communicate with the local people .
Those make you have a peaceful and joyable time .
If you are not familar with this , something unhappy will happen .

Furthermore , travelling with guide can save your time and enery in your jouney .
As we know , we only have limited time to spend our holiday .
We should have good use of our time in our jouney .
So , company with the tour guide , you will get the most valueble information about where is the best place you have to see , and how to get the convenience way to get there .
It gives you the chance to attain the wonderful time .

Sure , for some brave people who want seek instinct , or specific experience , traveling alone is not bad way , but you may meet unpredict things that maybe hurt you .
For most of common people , life is worthy to perish .

In a word , it is quite better way to travel in a group with a tour guide for its safty , fullful experience and saving way .
Taking accounot of these aspects , we can reach the conclusion .
