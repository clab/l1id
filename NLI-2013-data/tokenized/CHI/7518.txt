Nowaday , an increasing number of people like travelling .
Someone said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because the guide know the place deeply than the travellers , and a group of people will make more funs .
But others think that travel with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfertable .
And i 'm one of them .

First of all , if you have a tour guide and a group of companiers , you will feel not very free .
Travelling with a tour guide , the plan will be formerly ordered , somethings you want to see a other thing or want to go to another place will not be alloweded .
You ca n't change the plan .
But for me , the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like , but i ca n't change , because of the whole groud .
That makes me feel very upset .
And a large mount of people will have a large mount of oppinions .
It 's difficult to recognize the idea .
And some people will not follow the rules .
Once i joined a travelling group , but we have to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some sceneries .
I felt that 's a waste of my time .

Then , travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy , you ca n't visit one thing in a comfertable way , there 's only limited time that you can stay in one place .
The whole journey is in a quick pace that you ca n't enjoy it .
And most of the tour guides will let you to some place whice they will get benifits from it .
But this kind of place really wastes our life .

As a result , as for as i am concerned , i think travelling only will one or two best friend or relatives without a tour guide is more free and comfertable .
