While many people preferred to travel in a group led by a tour guider , there are many people agree with me to choose to travel alone .
There are reasons behind of each choice .
There are 3 main reasons supporting mine .

First , it is not necessary for me to go with a group because I can make a research on internet about the destination , such as where should I go ?
what should I see , and book airline tickets based on ca careful comparation of a few tickets service .
I will have freedom to stay longer if I need , which travelling with group wont tolerated .

Second , it is a challenging and surprising expereince while travelling alone , without tour guider telling me what is ahead , I would find out what I need by asking a local residents , or plan by reading the map .
One of the major reasons that we desire to travel is jump out from our daily routine which caused us missing our creativity and sense of freshness .
So trveling alone can fullfill this need , make our soul refreshened in a brand new way .

Last but not least , by travel alone I dont have to share a room with someone neither my parent , nor my husband .
It is important to have a privacy and freedom to sleep over , because travel is a way to relax and refresh , not only a creative way to catching bus , setting clock to get up earlier and being around crowds , like we used to in our work days .

It is real luxury to travel alone in those beautiful , unique towns .
I always choose traveling alone , even in my 2 years grand tour and study abroad in Switzerland , -- it is a breath taking journey , full of beautiful surprises as life itself is .
More challenging we are willing to take , more views we can see .
I preferred and always will traveling alone , for its challenge , uniquness and luxury of sleep over .
