Although many people say that we will not use cars anymore in the future , yet cars are necessasy tools even in the future .
Namely .
cars will still prevail .
For this purpose , I do n't agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
Here comes discussion .

In the first place , Cars are great inventions .
There are a variety of them and they help us a lot ; for example , transportation - both humans and cargoes .
Besides , they save time .
We benefit from cars very much .

Undeniably , convenient as cars contribute , we can not ignore the negaitve impact they make ; say , the exhaust and energy crsis .
However , scientists are now trying to figure out some alternative solutions such as biodiesel .
Using biological sources , cars will not cause environmental problems .
Since new tecnology has been develpoping in a breathtaking speed , I am optimistic about the futhure .

In my opinion , cars will exsit , maybe changing into another form , but they will always exsit .
After all , we ca n't live in a world with cars .
They are too important to be thrown away .
There will be more and more cars in the following decades .

Advantages can turn out to be malign while misfortune to be a blessing .
In brief , however , we should not abandon cars , not only because they symboize the milestone of human history but also because they are practical , even in the future .
