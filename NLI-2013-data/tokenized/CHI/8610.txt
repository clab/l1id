I think it depends on the age of the student .
For young students , like secondary and high school it will be more important to to know about ideas and concepts .
Students at this age still at beginning stage or we can say learning state .

They have learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future .
Even they may learn from what happening in the history .
By learning theories , students will think about what will happened in the application of the theory .

While the older students , at university for example , have to learn more the facts .
They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get .
Without ideas or concepts , students will not know whether it is right or not .

Older students should apply the theories they get in real life .
Then , by knowing the results , the new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results .
This will be worthfull experience for stude For example , they are two kinds of cost in production , fix and variable cost .
Fix cost should not be change at any sum of productions .
But when we increase or quantity any certain level , the fix cost will change .

Thus , ideas or concepts and facts support each other .
Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts .
Because some of the facts may be come from ideas or concepts .
The plane can fly is the fact .
How the plane can fly came from the concept of researchers in their good calculation when making the plane .
