Though discussed for long , the question that wether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is better does n't have a peaceful end .

For my opinion , I prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific .
There are three advantages of a broad knowledge make me feel like it : Firstly , broad knowledge means tends to support more comunication between peoples which means more understand .
You 'll get more characters in common with others when you share some knowledge with others , so you 'll probably get to know what the likes and dislikes for other people , for example , my father can understand me quite well for he know all that what i have known ; Secondly , this will make you more successful in social activities .
As you understand others more and give them what they want , get rid of what they do n't want , you 'll build a good relationship with any others and gain their help when you need .
As for example , many political leaders and business champions are this kind , such as Bush and Bill Gates .

Last but maybe the most important point , you 'll find the knowledge of each specfic domain are connected to each other .
In fact , under some situation , the connection is even more important in each of the individual ones .
Take Computer Lingustics for example , before 1980 , Lingustics is not considered to be a popular research area , but after the induction of computer , more and more organizations and people devote themselves in it , even govment cast an interest on it , and it is a hot research domain now , both for domain of Lingustics and domain of Computer Science .

Since all of above , I prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific .
