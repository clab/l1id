From my perspective , I do agree with the concept of young people nowaways do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The reason why I have a strong feeling towards it is because that for the past four years I have been helping at the orphanage constantly , but I seldom find any other young adult like me who is willing to take part of their time off in a week or a month to help out those who are in needs .

Maybe I am being too harsh on my peers for asking them to give something back for their community , but somehow I start seeing my country , Taiwan , has becoming a place with cold-hearded younger generations .

Since I am a person who walks between the two worlds , the United States and Taiwan , I share my equal halves on both of my homes .
I often sign up community survives with my peers in the States to just more or less make our community better , and to provide some care and love for the people who really need it .
Most importantly , I feel happiness around , and some senses of having a meaningful life .
I even see more young adults in the States are willing to help out their community by doing any kind of service .
Maybe that is why the States is still growing as a steadlily country , and this is something that my Chinese folks will never understand .

There might be some factors for causing this kind of tragedy .
Students here are still being punished with corperal punishments , and their teachers always brainwash them by telling them that school and grades come first , and nothing else is far more important than academics .
Maybe therefore kids stop concerning about what they should actually be caring about .
The outside world is no longer a huge impact on their life besides schooling .
I think this is one of the major problems which drag young people to become less prone to serving back their communities .

What we need in the society now is someone who has broader horizon , and audacious enough to show some passions to encourage our young people to once be able to provide some time to help out their communities .
Sometimes I do feel it is a posterous thing to realize that there are less people who are willing to assist their communities , but I certainly do understand that it is because of the surrounding people are living in , with pressure and income difficulties , that they cannot even have a time to rest and think about the things that will bring love and happiness to other people and their further generations .
