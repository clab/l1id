I am agree the most advertisement make products seem much better that tehy really are for following two reasons , the most of advertisements make their products looks better then they are , the advertisements hired good looking and body to deceive the specially people , First of all , most of advetisements make their products looks so fine .
For example , MC Donald always show the people eat energiclly food in the moring and it will provide the nutrition in a day .
But they did n't say how fat per chicken , if you eat two meals in the morning , how much weight you will gain .
Moreover , the nike company they hired the sport star to do exercise and show it on TV , but it is not to demostrate if we wear the specially products , we will become expert in this area .

Second , most of advertisement , they always foucus the distinguished gruop of people and show the grest idea in it .
For instances , in my country , they have an organization for fat people , they made a special plan for each person and promise it will sucessfully to lose your weight in a month .
They hired the model who have good looking and body and claimed if you take this plan , you will have good sheap like them .
However , it always not exactly to follow the plan they made , so they sued each other .

In summary , most of advertisments make products seem much better than they really are is the ture .
The orgainzation , nike company and MC Donald are just the few example that I meation it .
