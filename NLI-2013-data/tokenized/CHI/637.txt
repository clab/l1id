This is controversial issue to decide whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to just specialize in one specific subject .
Depending on personal experience and emotinal concern , we may find that some people will agree the statement , on the other hand , some people will choose the opposite decision .
The choice , nevertheless , is hard to make .
However , from my point of view , it is wise to agree the statement .
My auguments are listed as following .

The essectial reason can by seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the requirement of our morden scoial and the work you have .
When I entered into the social and starting my first task , I know that knowledge of one specific subject is not enough .
For example , when you examining project finance in bank , you should know many things relating to accounting , project analyzing , risk management .
During the process of examing those projects , it will be difficult for persons majoring in financing to analyzing the prospect of project such as steal , mobile and telecommunication .
So , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help you solve those problems .

Another reason of my view is that the trendency of the development of science .
For example , accounting belongs to the economic science and information theory belongs to the communication science .
However , the blend of the theory of accounting and informaiton in the last centry produced a new catelog named the theory of accounting information .
So , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may spur the development of science .

Though I agree that there may be a piece of advantage of specializing in one specific subject , the disadvantages are abvious such as lagging the development of morden social and science .

To sum up , given these reasons that are discussed above , I strongly commit to the notion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
