To understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts always is a important question when teacher or parents educated children .
It is a chicken-egg question , I think .
But I prefer to let students to learn facts at first .

Facts are the real reflection of the ideas and concepts .
It is the real item , visual image , or true things happens in everyday live .
We can catch it around us , we can feel it beside us , we can heard it from surrounding evironment .
It does not like the imagination of ideas and concepts ; it is the real version of ideas and concepts .

How do the ideas and concepts come from and where do they come from ?
This is the relationship between ideas and facts .
Most ideas come from the thinking and studying of facts .
From this point , we can state : facts are the mother of ideas and concepts .
If everyone just thinking everyday , and nobody come to the real world and make these ideas come true , what will our world become ?

Also , facts will help us to understand ideas and concepts deeper and stronger .
For instance , many people have taken chemistry , biology , or other science courses during high school .
Teachers always let students to do differetn laboratry when studying a new subject .
The different lab and the observations of these activities are the fact .
Most teacher want students to understand the ideas or concepts that they tell students more impressive .
The visual items or truth can help people memorize and understand more effectively .

As I studying different subjects , I usually prefer to know the facts of them .
After that , I can see the real reflection of it and figure out how to reinforce the deep thinking that hide back of the topic .
Although ideas and concepts are the basic of almost facts , to see the items related to our real life is more useful for me .
