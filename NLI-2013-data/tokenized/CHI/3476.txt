Well that is a good question , Because I never thaught of it before !
In my country young do n't get a chance to see eachother after class !
For most of us always goes to cram school till 9 or 10 p.m. After we will have to go home immidiutly or else the police will think that : Hay !
what is a middle school fooling around at that late , is he going to rubb someone .
And then he will take you back to the police station .
After that your parents will have to pick ypu up !

But , we always log on MSN or SKY-PE to communicate with each other !
and we might spent 1 or 2 hours doing that a day .
By doing that we will spent about 6 hours to communicate .

Other than that we often og out together on weekends to go biking or fishing and even golfing !
Sometimes we go to others house to discuss homeworks together .
Even if we are not talking about homeworks we will talk about something like ecosystem ecological and science .
That way we can spent some time together .
But if any big test is comming we will stop doing that , that is for our goods .

After the activity we have done all week we proubably spent more time with friends than our own parents .
So i think we have given enough time tohelp our communities .
And Even too much !

Now I think I can say that we have already spent enough time on that .
And also I am not agreed with that .
I think I have already expland why I made up my mind to disagrss with that , so I do n't have to do it again right .

No matter who said that [ Young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities } He should take the word back !
