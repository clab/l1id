When people talk about traveling , most people will want to join a group which will be led by a tour guide .
I always ponder on the reason why they make such an ignorant decision .
With a tour guide , one can hardly have enough time to appreciate the traveling , with a tour guid , one can no longer be free , and with a tour guid , one has to pay .

In my life , my first travel was to New York and i thought of it as a horrible trip , because i was basically like a robot which was controlled by the tour guide .
Even buying a icecream across the street needed his permission .
I knew that he did n't want any of his client be lost , but i was totally restrained under his rule .
I no longer felt that i was on a trip which i was supposed to enjoy .

The first monument that i visited was the Liberal Bell which was protected by some special glasses .
With that godlike tour guide , i can hardly read any information on this bell .
Before having read about its derivation , i was `` told '' to leave , because the bus was leaving .
If i did n't have that tour i would have learned so much about this wonderful bell whille enjoying the trip .

When we arrived at the Hotel which we were going to sleepover tonight , i was `` told '' not to leave the hotel .
I felt that i was restained in this `` jail '' .
It was so absurd to me that i was not free on my own trip .
It was not that i could not speak english and would have language barrier between the people .
With this limit freedom , i could barely do anything .

When i reached the end of this `` wonderful '' trip , i needed to pay this guide who spoiled my trip money .
The whole concept of having a tour guide is ridiculous .

People may feel unsecured without having a guide but that 's part of our life .
Nobody goes to a strange place and immediately , he knows everything .
Trip without a tour guide is a true vacation .
One can freely walk on the street to view the wonderful city , New York .
One can interact with the people on the street without any worry of time limit , and one can truely enjoy one 's vacation .
