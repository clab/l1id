It is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , the human has long memerise and short memerise .
When we try to remember something whether difficult or simple , finally we hope that it will be the long memerise .
The opposite is that just know the facts .

I am going to have three my own example and opinion for showing that to understand ideas is more better than learn in facts First of it , I use Trigtion Algebra or even a sentence in english class .
when we are going to understand about how to use or calculate .
We should understand the ideas of it or the question dont have limit in any situation .
If you just learn facts , then you are going to figure out nothing in the math , because it too many thing you learn in facts , or its too many things you dont try to understand ideas .

Second is about a sentence or a new vocabulary that you have never seen before .
If you try to understand whats going on in this sentence or try to know whats the definision about this vocabulary , then as soon as you dont need to remember or even '' learn facts '' , you can understand or to know how to use it , because you understand ideas , and the sentence or vocabulary will become part of your body and in your mind for the long time .

Third opinion about understand the ideas is when understand whats the meaning of the stuff then its more easy than just remember it , because the question or a sentence will always be changing whatever or anytime , if we learn facts in Algebra you will remember for your all life , if its english , then you will remember at first second or first two day , but after the days then you will forget , then your study life will be always in remember and forget .

My conclusion is we should study to '' understand ideas '' not to learn facts .
And above those three opinions I
