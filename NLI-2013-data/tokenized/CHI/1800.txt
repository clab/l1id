Nowadays , there are many new things appearing day by day , including some new techoniques , such as computer , internet and so on .
Sometimes we may think these new things are just preparied for young people , because it is very hard for older people to be adapt to such things .
So , some people draw a conclusion that ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' .
As far as I am conserned , I totally disaree with this statement .
There are several reasons .

Firstly , some young people just are addicted to the ` new things ' , such as computer games .
They do n't know how to deal with such things .
And they do n't know how to benefit from these things .
On the other hand , the older people do know .
Once they get to know that something is useful for them , they can get involved in it and enjoy it .
When I was a undergrad , some of my classmates were addicted by a computer game , namely Counter Strike , when they play this game , they could forget to have food , forget to sleep .
It did halm to their health , then how can we say that they were enjoying their life when playing such games ?
However , hardly can we hear older people do the same things .

Secondly , older people know more about life .
Maybe they do n't know many new things , but they can understand every new things .
They can judge correctly whether those new things are useful for them .
They are able to enjoy every new thing for them .
While usually , the young people can not do this .

Lastly , nowadays , many young men tend to be more selfish , more temptuous , more ill-tempered .
Thus , it is more difficult for them to share things with others , to have good friends , to understand this society , this world .
And these things are the most important things for our lives .
Older people do it better .
So , actually , older people enjoy life more than young peole .

In summary , in modern days , although young men may know more news things than older people , they do n't enjoy life more than older people .
