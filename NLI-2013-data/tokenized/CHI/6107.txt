I do agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today despite the rapid increase of car consumption .
My reasons to believe so are stated below .

First of all , more and more people are willing to take mass transportation to go to work nowadays than a few years ago .
Because the traffic jam is more and more serious , people living in the cities prefer to take buses and subways to go to work to avoid such heavy traffic jams .
With the scarce of resource this problem might not be solved in years .
What 's more , to ride in mass transportation saves people valuable time to do other productive things .
Beside riding on mass transportation give city people more time to relax and think for their lives on their way home and to work .

Secondly , governments all over the world are becoming more aware of the pollution cars bring .
Some governments even set up rules to ban certain cars to run in the cities during paticular times .
Such rules forbiding the use of certain cars will continue to effect in the long run .
This will help to reduce the use of cars gradually .

Thirdly , people today are more concerned with their own health than ever .
Some may even walk to work or ride a bike to work instead of driving a car .
On weekend , more people go biking instead of go driving to rural resorts to relax .
Taking the popular biking clubs for example , they are developing quite rapidly to support the idea a lot of people are holding today that it 's better to travel along with physical exercises .
These kind of change helps me to belief that there will be fewer cars in the future .

In spite of all the above , the rapidly developed mass tranportation system and the widely accepted concept that health is most important in one 's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To sum up , with the widely spreading concept of maintaining good health , the utility of advanced mass transportation and the help of the govenment , there will be fewer cars in 20 years use than there are today .
