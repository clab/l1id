Cars are among the greatest inventions of the time .
Acting as a product of modern technolody , cars have greatly enhanced our mobility .
Whenever we want to visit friends , watch a play , or take our children to school , they 're always there .
Aware of all these benefits , I still believe that the number of cars will greatly decline in two decades .

So serious is the environmental problem on earth that we 're forced into looking for their origins .
Cars are mainly responsible for the air pollution .
Hardly can anyone find pure blue sky in a car-intense city .
Being regarded as of great use , we fail to recognize how many tons of poisonuous gas they produce everytime we drive on the road .
We have no choice but to limit the use of cars , or else our descendants will only have access to blue sky in the photos and their parents ' memories .

Meanwhile , take a look at the traffic jams in big cities .
Most people live in noise , work in noise and die in noise .
How many people are in the hospital , concerning ear problems because of the noise ?
Numerous .
How many lives are deprived of by traffic accidents ?
Countless .
Who is the killer ?
The cars .
Cars are so dangerous that we 're doomed to reduce their number in the future .

With the advance of civilization , there will be fewer cars in the future .
While some people still live under the illusion that cars are somehow helpful , pollution , noise and accidents are already too high a price we paid for the use of this transportation .
If cars are not limited , the blue sky , the clean atmosphere , the sense of security of people , will all become a golden memory .
