Given the choice about Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities I agree or disagree .
I agree this topic .
There are three reasons was followed .

First , Our eduction never encouraged them : `` You need to help their communities . ''
Instead of communities helping always become a way to make them be good .
So , they did n't want to join the communities helping .
They feel this is not a good thing .

Second , young people have too many choice to get a right one .
Today in Taiwan , homework always full of young people time .
It is impossible that claim they to help communities .
Young people always feel too tired to do others thing .
They only care about their grades .

Third , young people merely think what is good for them .
And their points always on dress , money , entertiment .
They did n't want to pay some time or money to help communities .
They feel this question of government .

To sum up , I think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think we should educate our young people to helping thier communities .
Because they can get many benifits when they start to pay their time .
Helping communities is a good thing we should do it .
