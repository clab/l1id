Nowadays , more and more cars are produced and sold .
Indeed , population is still increasing all over the world , developing countries are richer and richer asking for all we have in developed countries such as computers , buildings or cars .
In twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , even if everybody can thinks the contrary .

Today , we have many ways to go from one point to another .
It means more buses , planes and cars of course .
Even if new kinds of transport could be built , cars will remain the best way to go to school , work and to go out because there are no a more convenient way of transport yet .
That will be true for at least 20 years .

Moreover , more and more government and associations would like to decrease the number of cars due to the pollution .
However , in the same time , more and more cars firms make research in developing new kinds of cars which could work with new ecological energies such as colza oil , electricity or else water .
For the moment , they only experiment these kinds of energy , but some cars are know working with both petrol oil and electricity .
Other experiences are also being made but it is difficult to know if they are available and cheap .
Indeed , the problem is also that these new cars have to be bought by everybody , so much so that they have to be cheap or rather not too expensive .

The last point I want to deal with is that developing countries are growing so fast that their needs are huge in new technologies and consequently in cars , because they also have to go to work .
Their needs will be much more important than in developed countries .
Indeed , in developed countries , we have sufficiently cars , although in China or in India , people who have enough money , and they are numerous now , want and need to have one .

To put in a nutshell , Cars will be more and more numerous in the World for at least twenty years .
Cars needs will decrease when new kinds of transport will be find or discover such as teletransportation or personal plane .
