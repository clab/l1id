Young people nowadays really do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
I agree with that .
Though some student club form for helping those old people who live alone and spend time on helping their communites , most of young people do not care about that .
Because in now days , everthing changes so fast , new things are invented everyday , they attract young people eyes .
Young people have more things need to learn than old time and there are not so many communtiy activities hold like old time .
That is why young people nowday will became like that .

More and more new things are invented to occupy young people 's time .
For example , internet , the greatest invention in 20s century , according to researching of scientist , teennager spend more than three hours a day on chatting or browsering website on the net .
Of course they wont have time to give their communitis .

New things means new knowlege , young people nowdays have much more things to learn than people old time .
Parent may sent their children to piano class in past , but parent have lots chosis , computer , painting , language and so on .
My friend 's kid comes home at nine o'clock because she need to attend two classes after school .

In old days , people always celebrate holiday by holding lots activies in community .
That makes peoples who lives in the same community to know each other , but nowday most of people do not even know the name of the people who live next door .
Of course , young people do not give their time to community , they do not event
