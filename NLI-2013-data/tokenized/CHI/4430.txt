I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
It is originated from the nature of the advertisement , the celebrities influence and weasal words in ads .

The purpose of advertisement is to get you to buy the products .
Of course , advertiser will try their best to make the advertisements as appealing as possible .
How to acchive that goal ?
They will have to exaggerate the products , sometimes unintentionally .
For example , certain vacuum machine claims that it will never lose grib of dirt on TV .
We all know that it cannot be true simply because all machines can not always perform the best with aging .

Additonally , Commercials use celebritoes to add glamour to their products .
Everyday , we see Paris Hilton , Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears appearing on TV with perfect make-up and well-fit jeans .
We might imagine if we use that makeup that we will look just like them .
Obviously , it is not true .
Not everyone has such a good face and such a sexy body , but the commercials mislead us to dream of that , those advertisements make the products seem so much better than they really are .

Finally , there are full of weasal words to fansinate customers , such as `` better '' , `` younger '' , '' faster '' , `` more '' , When a toothpaste advertisement says '' we kill more oral germs than competitive brand does '' .
We have to ask `` how much more ? ''
One more ?
Two more ?
Or in fact no more at all ?
It can not be proved .
It alwalys easier to talk the talking .
Similarily , When a car says it can run faster , we have to know what the car is faster than .
A bike ?
A scooter ?

In conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to the nature of advertisement , the celebrities influence and weasal words .
We have to use our own judgements to choose carefully something that is really good for us .
Do n't follow ads blindly .
