Nowadays , people love to travel since it is not a hard thing to do anymore after the invention of aeroplanes .
Traveling is definitely a good idea to explore more about other countries , learn about other culture and also relax yourself from the intense work .
Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However , I do not agree with this statment and I think traveling on your own , or with your family or close friends , is a better choice .

Traveling is assumed to be a relaxing activity during holidays .
If you travel with a group of people led by a tour guide , you may not get the relaxing result due to two reasons .
First , you do not have the right to choose whom to go with .
If you are in a group that has some people with bad personalities or hard to get along with , your trip will be ruined .
Second , usually the tour guide plans a tight schdule for the group since he or she wants to show the group as much as possible .
You may have to stay up until eleven or even twelve at night but be asked to wake up at around six or seven in the morning .
After traveling , you may actually feel more tired than before , which is not relaxing at all .

If you go traveling on your own , then you will have to plan the trip all by yourself , which is indeed a fun thing to do .
While you are planning thr trip , you have to do research about the place that you will visit .
Although this may be time-consuming , you know more about the place by reading the culture and probably a little bit history of the place .
Not only can this widen your horizon , but also increase your interest about the place you will be traveling .
You will then have more fun during the real trip .

Also , finding the tour that has the combination of places that you want to visit is hard .
Even you get the right combination , you may not get the time that you want to stay , the hotel that you like or the length of the trip that you want .
If you really find your perfect tour , you may find its price is unreasonably high .

In a word , the ideal way to travel is on your own .
You can decide everything by yourself and also spend the amount of money that you want to spend .
This is the way to have a really relaxing and fun trip you want .
