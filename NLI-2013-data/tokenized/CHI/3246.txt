We are now in a youth communities , all the benifits are given to the young people first then the sinior citizen .
I agree that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Nowadays , the young generation do n't really involved in all this politics , social issues that occured in their country or state .
Firstly , i would like to say that our young people are not encouraged by their friends , family , or societies .
Besides that , the education are not really emphazing it as a very important issues to help the communities .
Young people are all ver In this new era , young people will be occupied by all the new entertainment .
our country are getting high tech , everything is so convenience .
For example , online shopping , we are able to purchase anything we want just with a click .
With this , the interaction between people and people is getting less and less .

This is a very competitive world , everyone wants to get the bests for themselves .
They want the best job , best car , best house , and etc .
So , everyone is trying their best to get what they want , they wo n't think of others , but only think of how to bettle with others to prove that they are the best .

My conclusion is that young people nowadys are very self centred , they only care for themselves but not for other people around them .
