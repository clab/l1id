I agree that most advertisements make products seem there are really are .
I had many experiences in this situation because the product seems very good in the advertisements .
There are three reasons to support my opinion .

Firstly , people make an advertisement in order to catch coustomers ' eyes , so it will talk about that it 's good for you when you choose to use it .
After people saw the advertisement , they would like to buy it in order to know ot is good or not .
sometime people will feel bad with it .

Secondly , the companies make products and they always hope that they can earn somme money by selling it .
They will let coustomers think that it 's a worth to buy , so they will talking it 's benifits in the advertisements .
For example , when they introduce a cookies , they might tell you it use honey not suger and they add the natural produce in the cookies .
It is good for your health and mind .
It also taste delicious .
People will be attacted and would like to try it .

Furthermore , the companies will invite a professional people to be the actor to introduce the products in the advertisements .
It seems that it is a good direction to buy the products .
Some people will believe it because it is introduced by a famous people .

To sum up , I believe that most advertisement make products seem there are .
It is a business to catch people ' eyes .
Nowaday , even we know the reason , we still would kike to buy the products and try to use it .
Some of them are really , some do n't .
People should get more informatin befort you buy a product and then you can find a useful things for yourself .
