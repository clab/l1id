In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject .
My reasons are as follaw : First , as a student , a young person just specialize in one specfic major is not enough for she or he to face the competitive world .
Nowadays the glloballizition is coming ture the differences about work abality between employees from different countries are less and less but the devoloping counties workers ask for less paiment .
so when we want to get a good job we ought to manage varity knowledge of many fields to improve our interrior value .
Second , knowledge from all kinds of sudjects may give you new view piont when you look at something , especialy something you are fammilly with .
for example history can tell you how things happend many years ago and even can give you some usefull advises when you aregoing to make a important chiose , while math will tell you someone is just a formular person are hardly able to change it we just use it .
That make you clever So I think broad knowledge are better .
