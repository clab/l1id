I disagree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Facts have more verious phononems and interested for students to understand .

It is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts .
People are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book .
For example , in a chemistry class , if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do ?
They prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students to image .
It is the easiler way to show the process of the reaction , like the colors , sounds , smell .
Also , it has the variaty of the facts which can attract the students attention .
If a teacher do not use the facts in class , the students maight feel tedious and boring to listen .
At that time , they will move their attetion to another things .
Thay will cause bad effects to undetstand the knowledge .
In conclusion , it is interesting to use facts more than memorize .

It is also a good way to help the student to remember the mathod by prove it through the facts .
Sometimes people maight not understand what the teacher are talking about in class .
They need a better inprovement to improve them understand .
For example , the students may not understand what is the wave like .
Because of wave is not seen by people , it do not have the color , smelt and sound .
At this time , if the teacher use a fact which is like put the method into a experiment .
The teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like .
That is why the facts have the better way to make the students understand .

In conslusion , using more facts are not only interested but more easier to help the students to understand than just read ideas and concepts .
