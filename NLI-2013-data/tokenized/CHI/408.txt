To be a broad-knowledge person or to be a specialized person depends on a case-by-case analysis .
When one wants to be a leader , it is better to manage as much and as broad as knowledge , while if one tends to be a technician , specialized knowledge is a better choice .

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects means a person holding variety of capabilities .
Thus leaders always need such ability .
Take the president , who is the leader of a country for example , such person always holds knowledge in many realms , from politics of course , to economics , laws , management , perhaps history , psychology and so forth .
Since with such broad knowledge , one can understand how the society is formed and know a lot about the world .
The most famous person of such kind is Aristole .
The broad reading and studying enable him to manage most of the subjects and to be a wise man .

On the other hand , since most of people who have broad knowledge often cannot specialize on any subject , our sociey also needs the person who has specialized knowledge .
In many industries , specialized person is more welcomed .
For example , in stock market , the person who specializes on stock or finance is preferable ; in companies like Dell or Microsoft , students who major in computer or computer science will be chosen ; also in some scientific research areas , having specialized knowledge will benefit the person a lot .
In one word , if one wants to work in specific area , it is bettere to manage specialized knowledge .

From the analysis above , it can be easily concluded that whether to have broad knowledge or one specific subject knowledge depends on the interet of a person .
From my point of view , I prefer to manage deeply on one specific subject and broad learning knowledge on other areas .
From doing that , I can be a person with broad knowledge which may do good when I make friends since they may come from different subjects of knowledge .
Also , with the knowledge of a specific area especially what I am most interested in , I can have a specific skill which will do favor when I apply for a job .

In conclusion , the choices between these two rely on a person 's own plan for the life .
To me , the combination of them is the best solution .
