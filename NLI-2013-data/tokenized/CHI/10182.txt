I agree with the statement .
First of all , every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people .
Because they 've found a way to get richness and success while orthers are still stay poor in either their money or their futures .

Successful people usually think differently .
For instance , an average person who makes about 50 thousand dollars a year would probaby save 10 to 20 thousand dollars in their banks .
What a successful person would do is using the money to invest onther than put that much money into bank .
That 's how a small amount of money gets larger and larger .

Successful people think things in advance .
They look at the market and they would know what hot deals are going on .
They would find out which you can and which you cannot do .
They would figure out which worthes the risk to invest .
In another words , they have the intellegence to distinguish good stuff and bad stuff .
Any way , successful people are usually business man .
My friend John is a stock bloker who works on wall steet .
He makes money only out fo look at how the stock goes .
He usually works at home , seldom go out .
But he knows every thing .
He gets information from the internet .

He 's just more than intellegent .
Once he knows what the stock would go , he knows for sure .
He 's just like genius .
Successful people are bave .
They would try things new , not afraid of the unkown future because they have the courage and the confidence to do their job good .
The know the will finally win the game and make their life better .
For example , my uncle Lee is a very successful person .
He makes a fortunes every year .
He 's always glad to try some new stuff even some of them are for teens .
But he 's already 50 .
He 's brave , not afaid of anything .
