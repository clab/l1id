Would you like to study broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?
I believe different people have different answers .
However , I prefer to study broad knowledge for several reasons below .

First , in fact , many students do not konw what they are really interested in .
As we know , nowadays , many students have a same problem that they do not like their majors .
Why dose this problem happen ?
I believe that it is resulted from that they are not interested in their majors .
If they can study broad knowledge of many academic subjects , they would find out that what they are really interested in .
This is very important .
Actually , I have this problems , too .
My major is material science .
And I can not study other subjects in my university .
However , i do not like my major , because I can not find out any interesting things from this major .
Every day I have to do experiments in my lab , which is boring .
In fact , I want to learn some subjects that I could communicate with other people .
I believe if I have another choice , I would not choose this major again .
As a result , I choose another major when I study for my mater degree now .

Second , in modern society , most of jobs require students have many skills , instead of a certain skill .
As we know , when people work in a company , he has to know how to use computer , because today most of works are finished on computers , and the communication with other thoughout Emails or MSN also need to be done on computers .
If this person only know about his major , such mathmetic , arts , or something else , I do not believe that he would have a capability for this work .
That is to say , he would be fired in future .
I believe this is a pity for our education in universites .
Consequently , we should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects to fillful the various requirement of many jobs .
If we have kinds of knowledge , we could do many jobs in a company , and we have more chances to get promotoed .
for example , if we learn knowledge about engeering and management in university , we could apply for two types of jobs in a company , which would be very useful for our career in the future .

However , to learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects does mean that it is unnecessary to specialize in one specific subject .
What I mean is that we should also be professional experts , because when we face with some difficulties in our work , we must have academic knowledge to address them .
This is of great essence to us .
In sum , we should learn broad knowledge in the first place , and then we also have to specialize in one specific subject .
