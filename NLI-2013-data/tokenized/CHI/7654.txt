I agree that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide even though some people might prefer travelling on their own .
First , people can make new friends in the tourist group .
When one person travels alone or with his or her family members only , it is quite possible that he or she willl get bored .
If people travel in a group , they can meet different people and make new friends with the group members during the trip .
Generally , tourists will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provides adequate time for people to get to know each other and make new friends .

Second , to travel in a group would bring more fun .
When people travel alone , they might feel it is a pity that nobody shares this experince with them .
While in a group , people can share this wonderful experience with the group members .
The lasting memory of travelling would be enriched by the happiness added by the group members .

Third , it would be efficient and organized when the tourist group is led by a guide .
The guide would arrange the travel in the best way , which means travellers need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travelling .
Travellers do not need to find information themselves and they do not need to worry about where to sleep at night , how to find the direction or how to take the transportation .
In addition , the tourist guide can provide adquate information for the history and uniqueness of the scenic spots .
The tourists only need to listen to the guide and enjoy themselves .

Because people can make new friends , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , I support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
