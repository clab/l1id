Travel indeed plays an important part in peoples live .
By traveling , one can enjoy the peaceful nature or to experience the life of people in different country .
Some people would like to travel along or with friends while other perfer to have a tour .
As far my concern , I think to have the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for it has many advantage compared with no guide .

First , if you are going to a place which has some protential dangerous during the visit , you will definitatly need some help .
For instance , mountain claimbing , it can be very dangerous when you walk on a unknown high mountain and without a people who fimilar with this area .
A guide can certain garantee a safe and happy trip .

Also , a guide can provide you more details about the place you visit which map ca n't tell you .
I was once visting a small town in Sichuan , China .
After walking pass all location on map , the guide told us there is an beautiful lake at the end of the road .
When we finnally arrived there , every people including me were shocked by the unbelievable beautiful view there .
I 'm sure that I 'll regret if we did n't ask for a guide at the trip .

Finnally , if you are going to visit a new country and want to experience the local culture by yourself , a tour guide in that place is inevitiblly needed .
By his or her introduction , you can easily talk and even live with local people .

Addmitidly , travel with no guide can give you more free choice .
But from that has been discusses above we can safely come to the conclution that to have a tour guide when you travel can provides a better tirp .
Because it is safe and can give you more happiness .
