I agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
Certainly , there are many reasons to discourage people from using and owning cars .
The first reason is pollution .
Cars burn fossil fuels which give out lots of greenhouse gases and other pollutants .
As people become more aware of the environment , more and more people are against the idea of using cars now and in the future .

The second reason discouaging the usage of cars is the depletion of resources .
The number of years we will be running out of petroleum is calculated and it is shortened again and again due to rising demand .
The price of oil skyrockets in recent years , and so does the price of gasoline .
SUVs are no longer favoured by the consumers and more and more people gave up driving their cars totally or reduce their usage of cars due to higher oil price .

As the number of cars on road increases steadily , road conjestion and parking space have become serious problems in many countries , especially in fast developing countries like China and India .
It is quite normal for a driver in Shanghai to take two hours to complete a twenty minutes drive in conjestion .
Finding a vacant parking place can take up to half an hour in the central part of Shanghai .
Unsurprisingly that many drivers get frustrated and give up private driving .

However , solutions to the problems of the current cars have been implemented and some of them are working .
Hybrid cars invented by Toyota are selling fast , because the hybrid car saves energy and use less gasoline .
But the problem of depletion of oil is not directly addressed here as the electricity needed to charge the hybrid cars is generated mainly using oil .
Oil price will still increase and discourage people to drive cars .
