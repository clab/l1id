It 's such a commen phenomenon , esparcially to the people who live in the prospers urban area , that large numbers of cars in the roads sometimes cause the heavy traffiic disabled .
However , I can say with confidence , even someone may argues , that the trouble will disappers eventually .
My reasones goes as follows .

Firstly , as we all know , the technology develops in such a rapid speed , that it 's a rule that the things which are not suitable for future will be replaced by others .
The cars is a good example to this point , no doubt , the cars will be , or in near futrue , replaced due to their drawbacks , such as the toxin air that they release , the big noises the cars produce , as well as its consumption of the gasolines , all of these fatal factors demonstrate that the cars are not suitable for our futrue , both of enviroment and our people 's health .

In addition , it 's a fact that the price of gasoline increases in a much grater pace than anytime in history .
However , the gasoline , which is the essencial `` food '' of cars , is none-reproduced resource , which means that the future of cars has been determined , due to the limitation of its oil resourse , the number of car has to be dropped .

And what 's more , just image what would be like if more and more people buy cars when accompanied by the quality of people 's live has become more and more better .
It will be a desaster for us if everyone can afford to buy a car , and put it into effect .

Based on these reasons , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use , all of the factors contribute the useless of cars in future , the problem of replacment of car , it is only the problem of time , not the problem whether it will occur or not .
