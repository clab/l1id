I agreed with the statement .
People who succeed try new things rather than doing what they have already know how to do well .
We will learn new things and gain some experience by trying new things .
These experience are precious .
We can only gain them when we tried !
And if it dose n't work or we are not satisfied with the result , we can keep on trying and trying until we are satisfied .

I have heard of a phrase `` People who are successful find solutions to solve their problem and people who are in failure try to find reasons for their problems '' and I think this phrase really makes sense .
We should always find the solution to solve our problems rather than finding reasons for the problems .

For example , a man named Tony .
He opened a bakery selling only toast and water .
Plain toast and water .
No one wants to come to his shop because there are only toast and water .
Suddenly he decided to try new things .
He decided to learn how to make begels , milkshakes and a variety of cakes such as Tiramisu and chocolate cakes .
He started to sell them after he have learned how to make them .
After a month he earned lots of money after selling all these snacks .
He became a successful businessman .

The reason why the man had became a successful businessman is that he tried new things .
And while he was trying , he also learned .
I do n't think the man will become a successful businessman if he did not try and do things that he have already know how to do such as buying jam to put onto the toast or frying eggs .
These are just a piece of cake even a children from kindergarden can do all these things !

There is also another example .
If we lose a job , why do n't we try another or open a business ?
We can always try and there will be a day we succeed .

In conclusion , agreed with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
