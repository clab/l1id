Many people believe that succeeding in a specific subject will result to the success in one 's career .
This is not the case , however .
I believe it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to succeed in life .
Knowledge is crucial , so knowing more is always better .
Examples of my opinion can be found in everyday situations .

First of all , in school , all-round students get better grades overall than students who do well in one subject and not so well in the rest .
In fact , schools promote that students should be aware of all subjects .
The students will then use the concepts they learn in school for real-life purposes .
Gaining more knowledge from different academic subjects results in a better understanding of different perspectives .

For example , if a student plans to go into business , he or she must learn the mandatory courses such as marketing and economics .
However , mastering in those courses does not guarantee that the student will become a successful businessman or businesswoman .
If the student has a broad knowledge of other academic subjects such as psychology or mathematics , he or she will know more about why a business succeeds or not and how to prevent a business from failing .
Though these courses are very different , knowing the general concepts will aid the student as it gives him or her different approaches and perspectives .

Another example is if a student wants to become a doctor .
Finishing medical school is just one step in becoming successful .
If the student does n't know the basic concepts of how to set up a clinic , then how will he or she perform his or her practices ?
Again , business and medicine are very different subjects , but knowing both results to better success .

In conclusion , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
Students are lucky to study many subjects in school because not only will they be aware of more perspectives , they can utilize all concepts in real life situations .
More knowledge leads to more success .
