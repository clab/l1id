I agree with quote because that they ca n't just only stay in what they already know they have to try new stuff just like what already , they should get more experience .

Another reason that I agree with the passage because try new stuff never make you hurt your self but it makes you learn lots of things from these new things , and maybe .
If you success you can try to conected on your work , it probably will get you better .

Things is for you to find out but is not for them to fid you this is a very simple thing to understand .
But some of them think that if they try new stuff maybe they will probably lose lots of stuff from what they usually have .
This is why they dont try new stuff , because they are afraid and they think they will lose every thing .

Why lots of rich people are success , because they take a chance to try what they got and what is new for them , and they are not afraid of it .
It really depends on if you want to give a chance or not , However if you does not try you still can be successful , Taking a chance is really a good optunity for you to get new stuff .

This makes me think alot on how people use what kind of point of view to make what kind of diction .
every one has a different point of view and they all think it in a different , some of them think it in a nagtive way but some of them dont .
this is really important point about how they think about trying new things .

When ever the chance come , you should take a shot to try , because it never hurts you it only be a better person .
Chance is not always stay beside you , so does trying new styff .
So I think every one sould at least try once .
