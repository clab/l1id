I have once read a book talking about different stressful situations people would encounter in their lives and some solutions to these tough problems .
One of the unfavorable issues highlighted in the book is how to deal with a heavy traffic jam .
Undoubtedly , those traffic problems , no matter in which part of the world , has been remaining as a big headache for an extremely long period of time .
It seems the governments have tried every possible way to figure it out .
Thus , here is our concerns : are these policies and strategies being put into effect ?
In other words , are we going to see fewer cars on the road in , say , twenty years ?
From my point of view , I assume the dream would become true one day in future , though , I 'm not good at forecasting things ahead .

Firstly , it is now strongly advocated by policy makers to take public transportation system rather than driving private cars when traveling outside .
As a matter of fact , this plan is working well steadily .
People gradually have noticed that it is more convenient to take buses or subway to go to work and school than to drive private cars .
Take the subway as a striking example , if you take it to go to work during the rush hour in the morning , you wo n't be faced with traffic problems at all .
You do n't have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of moving your cars , in this sense , you can totally guarantee your arriving time at office and have nothing to worry about in terms of being late .
I believe there is nobody who would like to be blamed by his boss every day merely for not being on time .
Consequently , I found no reason for people to ignore the positive alternatives and still stick to his traditional and impractical ways .
In this case , there will be fewer and fewer people who purchase cars , or at least drive their cars during rush hours on weekdays .

Furthermore , the price of gasoline is increasing rapidly in recent time , which causes more and more people to complain that they barely could afford the cost .
Thus , in light of being more economical , the majority of people would not incline to buy more cars .
