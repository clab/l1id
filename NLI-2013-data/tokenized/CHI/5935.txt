Cars are the major transportation in the modern society .
In my opinion , there wo n't be fewer cars than there are today .
People are getting more and more today so that they need more cars .
Also , people 's lives condition are getting better .
Many family need more than one car .
The techology is developping , people discover many type of energy sources for cars .
Many kinds of energy are cleaner than the regular gas .

The cars ' number is growing with the population .
People are the heart of the society .
The society moves for the people and the people move with the cars .
In America , people would n't live without the cars .
People are getting more and the cars have to be more too .
It 's easier to go around with car than the publish transportation .

People have more money they will buy more cars .
In America , alot of family have more than one cars , and futhermore some of them have three or four .
People just do n't satisfy with just one car .
It seems like how many cars or what kind of cars you have can show how rich you are .
If they have extra money , they want to buy cars .

The energy for the cars is much cleaner than before .
In the modern society , the techology is always going so fast .
In the past they think cars make the air very bad and in fact , they did .
So people try so hard to find many type of different energy for the car .
And they did it .

No matter when , the cars will get more and more .
They need them so bad and they wo n't get rid of them right away , maybe for 100 year
