I believe that every one have an experience of watching or listening to a advertisements .
Do you ever think those advertisement really plays and important role for their products ?
Or are those products seem much better than they really are ?

In my point of view , advertisements really works well for those who make the business , it motivates cunsumer to purchase on their items , but if we take a close look at some commercials on the TV , their always presenting you the positive side of their products , instead of the things that have left behind , for example , we often see some shampoo commercials on TV , using those ladys with long hair showing you that if you use this brand of shampoo you will have the same shining hair as the lady have on the commercials .
This obviously is not true , on the TV they are putting on some chemicals that make their hair look smoothly and shining , but not the really affect that cused by the real product that they persuade the consumer to buy .
That 's why I highly do n't agree with the commercials .

Another example , if we go on shopping at some supremarkets , you will see all kinds of delicious images on the paces , like forzen pizzas , this image shows you that it got variety of ingredients on it and the size of the pizza .
We might think this is what the pizza going to be look like after I take back home and cook it , but infortuantly it 's not what you thought , those images are only look good on the pack for cosumers to buy it , in order to get the profit form the consumers .
So would you still believe in those advertisements ?

These advertisements might have a good looking on the outside , but what really in the inside we 'll never able to know .
So think carefully before you purchase , do n't let those unreal images affects you and take away you money .
