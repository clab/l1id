As a college student study in Taiwan , based on what I do in the past years and my observation on my friends , I agree with that young people nowadays actually do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I know I am kind of reluctant to admit the truth , yet I think the following reasons could explain why we are not able to do so .

In the first place , we are actually too busy in our school lifes .
As you know , people at this age are expected by elders or even by themselves to be as competitive as we could be .
This means we have to spend most of our time on taking lectures in different fields , learning precious experiences from dealing with club affairs , and some of us even already having internships in company .
In the rest of our time , there are a lot of reading materials and projects waiting to be treated .
And as a human being , we need time to play as well as to take a rest .
It is too hard for the young people to put their attention on the need of their communities if they are already bearing so many requirements .

The other reasons is that the concept of helping each other in a community has not yet formed in my culture .
I mean , it is not part of our life .
We are told since young to take care of yourself first then consider to give the rest to others .
So if a new idea is introducing to my country -- like encouraging youngsters to do something for the place they dwell in -- it must first serves as a requirement in school .
My college implemented a new policy last year that every students should earn at least 36 service hours before they can graduate .
Yet the service on school campus is also counted in the required hours .
The result is that , most of the students still do not learn the spirit of devoting to their community .

I know the fact is quite daunting to those who wish the new generation to do more to where it live in ; however , the reasons above which stop us from that also discourages me .
I hope things would get better
