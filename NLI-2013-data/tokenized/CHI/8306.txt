In my opinion , I agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , sometimes the what we see or hear is not the fact .
like long time ago people think the earth is a rectangle , because the roads are flat .
But after several years of searching and experience , now the fact become that the earth is like a ball .
So it is important to underatnad the ideas and concepts , then we wo n't be cheated by what we see by our limited vision .

Second , it is important to understand ideas and concepts because it 's the way for us to get the truth and concepts .
For example , after a stuent learned and understand the ideas and concepts , then they can use it to discover or create new stuff .
I think that 's why we envent lost of new things like car and plain to make our life easier .
So i believe that understand ideas and concepts are more important for student .

Third , it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts because in this way , student start to think , and become creative .
They can use their imagination to creat new ideas and conceptes , and their imagination is not limited by the facts .
It 's a good way to encourage student to search , think and find the answer they want .
So it is not that important to let the student learn the facts .

In conclusion , I believe that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because in this way student can imagine and think freely , and creat new things that 's unique .
And it 's good for us to find the truth and real facts .
