Basicly , I do strongly agree woth the idea tha successful people would like to try some new things compare with doing somethings that thay already know how to run it .
I support this with the following reasons .

As we know , new we faced a new time that millions of people suvive in this world .
The compete increases every day .
If we just following other 's step , we could not success .
An example could give some light to this point .
Bill Gate , who is growing from a poor boy to the richest person in the world , gave up his undergraduate study when he is a junior and then donate himself to his own caree .
Just think about that what if he didnot have this decition ?
We may have a good professor or a good researcher , but not today 's Bill .

Secondly , this is a idom that ' no pay , on gain ' .
This is just tell you a truth that you cannot success without any payment .
It is real that someone can gain a good lives by chance , but in most condition , try new thing and take risks mean you have more chances than other person .

Last , but not least , under some circumstances , some people do have some good result by doing some mormal things before .
However , in this special environment currently , most people spend their lives in the same mode : go to school , graduate , get a not bad job and finally get married .
How can you distinct from others ?
Just use your special thought .
For instance , You think about thing in a totally new way , you may get more advantages to success .

So , based on the above disscusion , we summurize a conclusion that the success always like to come to those people who like chanllage theirselves and dare to take risks for their caree .
