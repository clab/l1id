The quality of successful people is usually discussed .
Some say that they are more prone to be adventurers , trying new things and taking risks , rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
From my view , I totally agree with this for the following reasons .

Without trying new things , nothing can be created .
When we look back what the great people in the past like Albert Einstein does , they made a lot of imaginative assumptions , and finally he revealed the famous physics equation and the great theory of relativity .
All these discoveries have brought about many benefits to us since their establishments .

Beside theories and discoveries , all inventions we usually every day would not exist should the great scientists did not try new things and take risks .
Think about the richest person in the world , Bill Gate .
he designed a software that our lives greatly rely upon it - Windows .
Without the ventures and new ideas , our world is just the same compared to our ancestors ' .

Not only scientists but many successful political leaders have this quality .
For instance , the first American president , George Washington , taking the risk to be arrested or even killed , led people to overthrow the colonial rule .
Others include the drafters of new ideologies like democracy and fair world trade .
They dared to introduce and more importantly , to implement them .
All these bring about significant impacts today , even they might live thousand years ago .

Another reason supporting the statement is their faith to success .
Their desire to find new things is a strong motivation for their work .
If people do not try new things , they recognize all what he can do .
There will not be new impacts on their lives .
Consequently , they have less motivation to strive for success and are easily conceited with their past achievements .

On the other hand , imagine a very diligent but conservative person who does merely whatever he knows .
Eventually , he is just a master of the present knowledge .
He cannot move further and stays at whatever he is .
Without new things and ideas , it would turn out to a very boring world .
Every thing repeats as it used to be and there is no surprise at all .

Considering the above , we see that trying new things and taking risks are important attributes to successful people .
