I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .
Because I believe that in the business world , the sales men always want to make money in the market , they have to make the products look more attractive than they really are .
There are my reasons as bellow .

First , in the competitive real world , the business man are always tring to make as much money as they could .
In this manner , they have to convinced customres to buy their products .
How can they achieve their goal ?
They will try to over describe the function of the product as it really does .
The product looks more attractive in the advertisment to persuade the customers to buy the product even they really not need it .
For example , I always buy some stuff that I really do not need .
Why I still buy them ?
Because of the attractive advertisments made me believe that the products are more efficient than I can imagine .

Second , the business man have to make their spending and income get balanced .
They spend a lot of money on advertisment , such like on the TV shows , newspapers , magazines , and even on the radio stations .
If they do not over describe how the product is greater than the others , the customers would not purchase it .
In addition , the sales man have to spend money to hire the designers who create the advertisments .
For these two reasons , the sales man have to make more and more money to compensate the money they spent on the advertisments .

To sum up , I believe that the products seem much better in the most advertisments than they really are .
We usually found out what the real product is after we bought it and used it .
It wastes customers ' money to try it if the sales man could truely describe the poduct on advertisment .
