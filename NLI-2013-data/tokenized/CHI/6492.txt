There are many cars used today .
I believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
The first reason that there will be fewer cars in twenty years is that the pollution issue is highly concerned by people .
Organizations are now devote to raise people 's caoncern of the pollusion problem .
Particles produced by cars are one of the main source of aair pollution .
As the air pollutant will harm human beings and people are concern their health , they take the pollution problem serious .
In order to tackle the problem , people will no longer use private cars to travel , but use public transport instead .
Travel by public transports are more environmental friendly , therefore , fewer private cars will be used .
As people become more concern about the environment , the number of cars will decrease in the twenty years .

Additionally , the technology progess very fast nowadays .
Public transports can have high speeds and can will not take too much time for people to travel from one place to another .
The time needed to travel by public transports will not differs to time needed to travel by private cars in twenty years .
And the transport network will be more well developed as time past .
As public transports are speedy and convenient , private cars will not have many advantages , but disadvantages as the cost of petrol , reting car park and repairment are very high .
With the disadvantages of using a private car , people will tend to travel by public transports instead of private cars .
Thus the number of cars will decrease dramatically in twnty years .

In conclusion , people 's concern of the pollution problem and the convenience of travelling by public transports will decrease number opf cars in twenty years .
