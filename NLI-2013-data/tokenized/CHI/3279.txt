I argee with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their communities .

With the development of technologies , more and more funny products are coming into exsitence and entering peoples ' daily life .
So it is not surprising to find that young people would spend hours on PC games alone , instead of taking care of or talking to some old people in hospital .

Take computer as an example .
A survey shows that global computer selling is contuniously growing , and so with the demand .
And some teenagers do claim that computer is their best friend .
With computers , they are able to chat with oversea friends , watching latest hot movies , or surfing on the internet .
Since the time in a day is 24 hours , which is eaqul to every one , they of course do not have more time left to help their communities .

By contrast , teenagers in the old days did not have such kind of entertainment .
Therefore , it was common for them to visit and help others ' families in their community .

Moreover , freedom resolution started in California of United States in the 1960s showed a wrong example to young people .
Instead of having a steady belief in God in mind , more and more people choose to believe nothing , which has already proved by a report on European citizens .
It is indeed correct that the nature of human beings is to help each other , but having some belief will enhance your feeling to giving a hand .
So lacking belief has surely a negative impact of those young people nowadays .

To sum up , I argue that too many kinds of entertainments and lack of belief lead to the fact the young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .
But I not saying that they are more selfish than before , rendering that there are just more aspects of life to pay attention to .
In order to make some changes to this situation , I would advise parents to spend more time on their children and show them some positive examples .
