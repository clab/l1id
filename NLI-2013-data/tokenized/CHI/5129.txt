A series of advertisements appear along the street , in the TV show and in the newspaper .
Colorful and well-designed advertisement definitely aborb the costumers to buy them .
Although there are some advertisement make products seem as same as they really are , most advertisement reveal the truth that they are not really as good as what do they showed on the advertisement for their taste , quaity and usefulness .

Taste become a comparatively important norms to be chased by people , Because people are curious to try some new style food other than some normal ones .
For example , the most famouse and prestige product-coca-cola .
Many kinds of advertiments appear about the new taste of coca-cola in the drug and supermarket .
I , at least , really want to try the new taste because of the advertisement But after I drank these new taste of cherry and coffee , the result is that it is not as good as the advertisements told me .

Quality is another problem that happens in the advertisement .
For instance , there are lots of resturants emerged because of the income of the people raise every year , especially the sea food resturants .
They advertise and promise their fishes or oysters are fresh aroud the year .
However , when we get there to taste the real fresh , the truth is revealed that not all the fishes are fresh .

House wifes really want to buy someuseful instrument that make their house work easier .
Many electronic instruments emerge , for example electric vacuum , knifes and laundaries .
My mother are often curious to buy many new stuffs after watching the TV and newspaper advertisements of them .
Finally , they become the garbages that occupy a lots of room .

In short , advertisements overshowed their taste , quality and usefulness that are different from their real one .
