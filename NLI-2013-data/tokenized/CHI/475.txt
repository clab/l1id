I am agree with that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific .
Someone around me I like them very much .
It is because them have many knowledge to share with me , and from different subjects .
I am a person who always keep a heart of curious , I want to know every thing around me , why the birds fly , why machines work , I ask and ask , my friends give the answers , I think they are Mr.Know-all .

It is not the most important reason for this topic .
However , I may use a exampel to say .
There is a Chinses book wrote by many centries ago .
People agrued about whether it is wrote by one person or two , and who is the second writer .
Many people searched in libery , history .
But they had not succeed .
About 50 years ago , a people who is specialized in stastics , gave us the answer with stastics mothed .
He compered the signs , marks and languege signals , and then , he find out the book was really wrote by two different writers .

Also , as you know , in science , physics and chemistry can not be without each other .
With out chemistry , physics can not describe something happened .
Be very proudly , there was a great Chinese teacher thounsands years ago had talk about this topic .
He said , if you had study one subject to the end , then you had already study others to the end .

It is hard to say that to specialize in one specific subject is not so good .
However , in my opinion , it is too narrow .
A wide knowledge will give us a good reason to carry on our study .
That 's all .
