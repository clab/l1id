With the development of tourism industry all over the world , more and more people will choose to travel in their leisure time .
However , the first problem the tourists will be confronted with is whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel alone .
While some people may appreciate the advantage of travelling in a group for its convenience and experieced guide , I tend to choose to travel alone .
The benefits of travelling alone are listed as follows : when you travel alone , you can meet new friends during the journey ; also , you can find that travelling is much more flexible than leading by a tour guide ; last , the price is lower when you travel on your own .

First in first , when you travel alone , chanced are that you will make new friends during your journey and thus share your experieces and knowledge about the destination , about the world and about the real life .
For example , once I travel alone in Beijing , the charming city in China , it so happened that when I was trying to climb up the Great Wall , a stranger lent me his hand and he helped me to finish climbing the wall .
After we reached the top , we were already good friends and communicated a lot on our tourist experience .
Up till today , he is still my best friend in my life and we keep in touch with each other by mail and share our journey .

The next point of travelling alone is its flexibility .
Just think , if I was led by a guide , I will be forced to leave or go to a place I do n't like very much and have to go when I really want to stay for more time .
While I travel alone , I can figure out my favorite places and to select the nearest routine to the destinations .
Whenever I want to stay for a while , I can just enjoy my time .
There is no restrictions for me to travel .

Last but not the least , I found that travelling alone can be much cheaper than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
As we all know , every travel agency must make profit to support their business .
Thus , they may be overcharged on the payment .
However , if I travel alone , I can save money for the sake of my own .
For example , I can choose the cheapest hotel rather than the expensive one .
Also I can choose to travel by train rather by air , which means a lot more expenditure .

As the reasons mentiond above , I prefer to travel on my own , not in a group .
The opportunities of making new friends , the flexibility of my travelling time and the economic fee I have to pay for my trip are all the factors that contribute to the reason .
