I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing familiar things .
In my opinion , successful people , especially in a business world , usually can imagine things that will happen in the future .
They can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new things that may lead them to success .

On the other hand , people who only do what they are familiar with do not have this kind of sight and ability to create things .
To be a successful people , you have to be a pioneer to try new things .
In the business world , `` Time is Money '' .
People do not only compete with others , they also fight for time .
Time is the factor that determines success or failure .
Therefore , trying new things is the key to success .
People who do not take this kind of risks can never be success .
They are just followers following the trend that the successful people created , which makes them always a few steps behind the successful people .

Risk taking is also an important part to achieve success .
Taking risk does not mean not caring about the probability to success .
As i mentioned , successful people have the sight to see future things .
The risk taking is based on what they see in the future .
Some people just do not have this kind of talent , if they do not think things over before taking a step , they will never be succeed .
Therefore , risk taking is blended with the ability to notice how the world is changing , not just taking risks randomly .

Based on my knowledge , I totally gree that the difference between successful people and the people that will never succeed are the gut and knowledge to try new things and take risks .
Those are the keys to success .
