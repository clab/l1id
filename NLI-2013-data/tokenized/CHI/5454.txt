Some people hold the opinion that most advertisements tell customers the products much better than they are .
Others , however , have nagetive attitude .
As far as I am concerned , I would like to vote for the agreement for this statement .
The arguments for this point are listed as followed :

First and foremost , the enlargement of the quality of some products in the ads is one of lots of reasons for inlustrate the phenominon of the adervertisement did not show the truth .
For example , once a couple hang around in a mall , a saler of TV told them the high resolution of that TV is the best quality to enjoy .
They bought it by costing more , but finnally they found the good quality only comes from the DVD presented in the mall .
So , it is reason why most consumers do not believe what the saler said .

There is another factor that deserves some words here .
The Ads always show fake feasure of the products .
For instance , the picture of the products showed online .
Once you buy a good looking stuff online , do not feel so happy at once that you got a great deal to have your favorate thing .
You maybe need to wait for the last moment that you recieve the shipped item you bought several days ago .

In addition , the gurantee of some produces doe not only want to show the coustomer their items have good lasting quality , but also want adding a attractive thing for asking you buy them .
If you finnally make a decision to buy them because of the gurantee policy , you may fall in a trap .

From I have discussed above , the enlargement of the quality of products , the more preety but not real picture of the products , and the fake gurantee for the stuff are all the ads showed the products much better than they really are
