There are many opinios on the subject that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think that many young people in my home country do not give their time to helping people .
There are few reasons for this .

Firstly , people in my home country are too busy to help people .
They always have a lot of work to do and they only have the tiny time to complete their work .
Take my friend , Chris , for example .
He worked in the hight technique company and he always worked overtime .
When he came home , it 's almost midnight .
On day , he saw a woman laid on the land and he knew he must find someone to help her .
He saw his watch and he found he was late to the meeting if he staied there to wait the emergancy car , so he just called the 911 for help and went away .
He knew that it 's wrong but he did n't have enough time to save her .
Thus , I think that people in may home country are too busy to helping other people who are in trouble .

Secondly , there are many lier in my home country .
People fair to be lied and they do n't want to lose some things .
For instance , my friend , Kitty , one day she walked on the street and she met a man to ask her that if she could lent him the cellphone to slove some problems .
The man promised that he would return the phone back to my friend right now when he finished his commversation .
Kitty agreed to lent the cellphone to him and waited nearby him .
At the next second , the man ran away and let Kitty staied there alone .
She shocked and she did n't know what happened .
She just saw the guy ran away with her cellphone and that monmet she knew she lose her phone .
Therefor , I think that there are many lier in my home country , so people will think twise when they want to help someone .
I think that 's why people in my home country do n't want to help a foreigner .

There are many people will disagree with me , saying that there are also many volunteer to help people in the sociaty .
However , I think that many people in my home country are too busy to help people who need help and I think that there are too many lier in my sociaty .
So , I think that many young people nowadays do not give enough time to help people .
