Nowadays , young people would not like to give their time to helping their communities .
There are several reasons to cause this problem .
In my opinion , most of the young people are egoist .
In their mind , they are not responsible to do something to helping their communities .
Their only responsibility is to helping their own house .
Besides that , they also think about that they can spend money to hire some guards or cleaners to keep the community safe and clean .
For example , my friend , Jean every month her family pay the maintanance fee to the maintanance department .
She had never attend any meeting in her community .
As I asked her why she did not attend the meeting , she answered me that she had paid the money and she was very busy to maintance her own house .

Secondly , the young people nowadays spend most of their time in studying .
It is because our parents always told us that if we got good result , then we would have a great future also .
Most of our parents would like us to concentrate in our studying and disagree us to join extra activities to waste time .
For example , I am a person who like to join the community activity .
Once day , my mother told me that she is not willing to see me spend my time in those activities .
It is because she think if I spend the time to join activities to studying , my result would be better .
However she does not like me to join the activities , but I still attend those activities because I can learn more .

Finally , some young people think that helping their communities are boring job .
They would prefer to playing online games and watching television programme at home or chatting with friends are more atrractive .
Some young girls always say that it was very tired to do the job in their communities , but I think they would not say that shopping in the shopping complex is also very tired .
For example , my brother is a very lazy person .
As we ask him to do anything , he will refuse us and sleep on the sofa .
Sometime as his friends ask him to go to cyber cafe playing online game , he will wake up immediately .
It is because the communities job cannot attract him .

As my conclusion , young people do n't like to spend their time to helping their communities because they are egoism , they are busy in their studying and the communities jobs are not attractive .
