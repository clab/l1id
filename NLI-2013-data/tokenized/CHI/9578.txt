We do n't know why some people can success easily than others ?
Many people may think because they are lucky or they have always had some people to help them .
However , in my opinion , I do agree that successful people try new thing and take risks raher than only doing waht they already know how to do well .
Because they are more creative and they know how to integrat their knowledge than others .

First of all , creative people have more chances to be successed .
If a person has a new useful idea to change old stuff , the person could have more chances to be successful .
For ecxample , one of my friends , he has always had new ideas to open his new business and he can find out the new business that other people ca n't see .
Even thought , there are many rsiks but he is willing to face this challenge and to get over it .
What I mean is that if a person has a creative personality and understand where the rsiks are .
This way a person will have more chances to be successful .
Therefore , i would say creative and aware of risks will provide people more chances to be successful .

Secondly , the ability to integrat our knowledge can help us success .
In the case of my friend , he has studied in bussiness school .
During the school time , he studied many different subjects such as accounting , fincial management or case study .
Base on these skills , he knew how to combine his knowledge in order to find out the risks and creat new business .
Hence , I would say the ability to integrat our knowledge is a basic skill to be successed .

To sum up , many people wonder how can they be successful ?
The problem is that we do n't integrat and use our knowledge , be more creative and be aware of the rsiks .
However , in my believe , I would say these are important characteristics to be successful .
