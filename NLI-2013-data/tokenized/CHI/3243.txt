Do you agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
For my personality and fondness , I agree that yonug people spend too less time on concerning their communicaties .
In addition , I will argue over the belife in the following reasons .

First of all , I think that young people spend too much time on their studing and playing .
For example , most of students go to library for researching informations after calss .
In addition , many students go to play baseball and suffer the internet in their free time .
Moreover , some young people prefer do other execise to help their communications .
Furthermore , young people think that it is waste time for helping communicaties .
In a word , few young people willing to helping their communicatiies .

Secondly , young people think that it is not necessary to help their communicatuies .
For example , many young people spend many on buying their toys instead of helping others .
In addition , most of young people think that communicaties is not their best friends or relates , so they do not willing help them .
Moreover , the soical structure has a great change nowdays , few young people has also change thier concept about how to help others .
Furthermore , young people has misleading concept that they do have responbilities to help others .
In short , many young people do not give enough time on thier communications .

In summary , I think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communicaties because they do not realize that helping other is an essential vituer and value for human .
In the end , I will conclude my argument by emphasizing that young people do not understand that the enjoyness and happiness from helping our communities .
