It seems difficult to choose one oppinion , becuse they are also have colorful life between the young people and the older people , but it does not mean , they are similar to me .
I would like to agree with the young people enjoy life more than older people do , if a personal quality is can considerated as criterion to choose things .

First of all , in nowadays , era of information , many of young people enjoy their life via the internet , even everything possiblly in the digital industy .
For example , if a grandson of the older people live abroad , and the communication between the grandson and the grandfather is only via the telephone instead the internet online chatting what is cheaper than the international telephone call , but the older people can not use the internet even can not use computer .

On the other condition , the young people can adapt anything quickly , so that they can migrate to another city for the different experience .
most of older persons can not accept the different enviroment and what they will eat in the different areas , if the older person migrate to other citys or countries , they will be illness easiler .

The important things determine the young people enjoy life better is that they are educated in the signifcant era of information , so they are developed with the world development .

For all mentioned above is why I agree with the staement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Now , I do strongly agree with the statement .
