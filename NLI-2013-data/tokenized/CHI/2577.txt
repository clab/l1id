I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Rather , I would suggest whether people can enjoy life is dependable to their belief and it is not related to their age .

Let me define what meaning of enjoy life is .
To me , enjoying life means that we should learn from each other , humble otherselves , be interested in relationship .
Moreover , we should learn to understand ourselves - our character , reaction , etc and utilize , share and enjoy what we have to one another .

Firstly , if we are humbling ourselves , it would make us easily learn from each other because we would not look down upon the others .
It could prevent from self-fishness .
For example , there are many wars nowadays and most likely , the cause is that we are doing things out of pride ( i.e. , not humbling ourselves ) and we are not thinking from the others ' perspective .
With war and conflicts , how can we enjoy life in an easier way ?
However , if we learn to humble ourselves , we would know how to express love to each other and we would feel joy to be loved and love another .
There would not be so many wars and conflicts such that we would easily enjoy the life .
Most importantly , being in a position of being loved is amazing .
If you have felt in such a state , you would know that having such a joy in your heart would be called enjoying life .

Secondly , if we would learn to understand ourselves and others from time to time , we would feel amazed how we are created in such a wonderful , creative and unique way .
For example , you cannot imagine how our eyes can view such a complicated object .
i.e. , with reflecting the lights , we would know how dark the object is .
We can find not only the appearance but also the character .
For example , there are some children who are extremely interested to talk with people while there are some children who are extremely interested in thinking .
With learning ourselves and the others , we would easily feel amazed how it could be very complicated and very unique .
With searching this kind of knowledge and love , we would also feel joy in our heart that through the joy , we would enjoy our life .

Finally , feeling beloved is easily understandable to have joy .
How could it be possible if all of us are just willing to be loved ?
Hence , it is easily to be confused that loving and share with others would not contribute to joy .
Selffishness would be .
However , it is not the case .
While learning to understand others and humble ourselves , it is so natural to share with others with what we have .
For example , if we are keen on hiking , it is so joyful to help others to hike with us through the difficulities .
Though it seems that it is difficult , the final achievement through toughship could bring us to have joy with one another .
It is just like that a couple could feel very warm when they can share their life with one another .
Hence , loving another could let us enjoy one and another and it would finish the cycle of love and being loved .

In conclusion , if we can follow a good belief , we could learn to enjoy life easily no matter we are young people or old people .
