From my point of view , it is not advisable to think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
my arguments for this point are listed as following .

The main reason for propensity for facts is more important is that ideas and concepts are just a part of one thing , but the facts are the whole parts of one thing .
for example , i am major in Japanese Language , the language itself is just a kind of ideas and concepts , so i need to learn its facts and inside , Japanese culture .
from i learn a lot of knowlege about the culture , then i can learn lauguage more quickly and unstandable , and i am interested in it a lot .

There is another reason that deserves some words here .
ideas and concepts are not related to the reality , but the facts is related to the reality of one thing , it help us get more experices from everyday .
to illustrate it , let us consider that when people graduate for school , they need to learn a lot of thing not only from the ideas and concepts , but also the students need to know the facts of job and sociaty .
they also use their ideas to do someting good , someting helpful , something important for this sociaty , so they must know the facts .
otherwise , they will do nothing useful .

Third , if you want to the fact of one thing , you must experience a lot of things , that means you need to do experiment to get it for you .
so the facts are very important for everyone .
if you do not the facts of one thing , that means you can not get one experience or a aspect of knowledge .
for example , i want to get my drive license , that means i need to know the knowlege about drive .
on the other hand , i need to learn how to drive on the road , and keep everyone in the car safety .
so ideas and concepts is not enough for me , i need to know the facts .

Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that to learn facts is more important than to learn the ideas and concepts .
