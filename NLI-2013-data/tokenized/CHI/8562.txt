Many things in the world are so complex , if we want to get all facts that it might be take a long time to understand all .
In my opinion , the efficient way to learn things is to get the main ideas and concepts , instead of understanding all the facts .

The better way to know a fact is to attemp getting it by ourselves .
If someone always tells you anything what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledge .
You just follow others steps , without thinking deeply .
You will not find other news dicovery , because you always think others ' opinions are correct .
It will stop prodessing , and it makes our brains get rusty .

For instanse , when I was studying in University , the professer always theach us the way to study , not following the books and reading that .
The meaning of teachers is to help students find their ways to research , they can tell us about different fields talking about .
If we are interested in some specific area , we should research more information about that by ourselves .
Afterward , analyze the information and discuss with professers .
It 's the way to learn knowledge , by means of the mothod and we can find more necessary information than we expect .

In my opinion , the better way to study is to understand main ideas and concepts .
If we just follow ours ' opinions , we can just stay in the same place , without process .
We should think something by ourselves , and it is possible for us to learn more things which we should know .
