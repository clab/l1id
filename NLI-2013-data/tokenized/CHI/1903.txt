From my point of view , I totally agreed this statement : Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Nowadays , a great many phenomena demonstrated that many youngsters are enjoying their golden life time than elder people .
I can lists them more reasonablely as following .

First of all , we should accepte this turth about the limits on human 's energy during their whole life-span .
As a matter of factor , young people have more physical energy than elders .
An increasing number young people can have extra energy to enjoy their beautiful life with many methods .
For instance , they can make a wonderful trip or visiting to various places as also go overseas .
Let take my own experience for example , in this summer , I had a wonderful trip to five different countries of Europe , including Germany , Switzerland , France , Netherlands , as well as Beligum .
At same time , I took total sixteen days to visit the Berlin Wall , Lourve Museum and also many famous historical sites and fantastic landscape .
Both of them can demonrtrate a young people has enough energy to enjoy life .

The second reason is from financial aspect of a person 's daily life .
Young have the economic ability can offer their expense on entainment , trip and any kinds of abilities for their life enjoying .
From the statistical data of personal expense all over our country in the first three months of this year , alomst 85 % young people can offer themself on enjoying life while only 15 % in old people .

As far as I am concerned , everyone can enjoy their lifetime both young peole and aslo the old people .
We both have wonderful lifetime and various kinds of abilities can related to enjoying our life .
But I do believe our young people can make full use of this opportunity to enjoy the fantastic world than old peoples .
