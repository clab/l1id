I would agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
There is a saying that `` Experience is the best teacher '' .
A person who is very successful must experience more in different ways and learn how to survive in different environment and not afraid of risks .
I will explain my opoins from the following aspects .

First of all , one of the most important character that a successful person should have is curiousity and a desire about learning new things .
Normally a new opportunity , new atmosphere and new people around can bring new sense and new pentientail for a person .
For example , a very famous Chinese writer Lu Xun .
He used to be a doctor , but he realized that doctor can only treat people 's sick instend of thinking .
So tried to start writing article and book , then his books influenced a generation of Chinese in 1920s .

Secondly , as a successful person , he must be very brave and taking risks in all different circumstances .
For example , Chairman Mao is a tipical successful leader who was always taking risks in this world .
He led Chinese people to stand up and build a new country in the east Asia .

Thirdly , I do n't think that a person who always keeps a position and never try new things in his life will be successful .
Keeping doing one thing for long time , people will become lazy and increative .
They just want to do the daily things and never think about do some different from others .

On the other hand , I also think that persistance is an very important character that a successful person should have .
For example , a scientist is doing lots of study and research focusing on specific fields and progects .
The job itself requires that he must know how to deal with his study and also must know how to do well .
It is essencial for a scientist that he must be pacient and concentrate on something instead of trying new things and taking risks .

In a nutshell , the successful people should have an couragement and disire for trying new things .
It is an important part for a successful person to take risks in order to get new opponities and petential so that he can make a difference in this worls .
