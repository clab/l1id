I disagree with this statement .
I strongly believe that in 20 years there will be more cars in use .

First .
Why do people buy cars ?
Because they want to get an easy access to everywhere .
They can go to wherever they want .
Though the mordern transportation has provided a fairly convenient ways for people to travel less time .
can a plain directly take you to a beautiful rural village ?
NO !
however if you own a car with GPRS .
You can go to every corner on the world .

Second .
What kind of people buy private cars in our country ?
The answer is wealthy people .
Now the number of the rich mushrooms , and these riches eagerly want to buy a car when they were in a poor status .
Becuase they thinks a car especially a high-ranked car can show their status .

In the common estate where i am living .
When i was very young , i could see few cars paking in the estate .
As i grow up , I can see more and more cars begin to park below my building .
Now the parking area has been fulled with cars .
What does that means ?
That means the living standards in my estate can show the whole cities living stantard is growing .
With rapid economic growth in our country , I hold that in our country there will be more and more cars , and so does it in the world .

Third .
Though a lot of people are complaining about the fact that car 's emission will cause the green house effect and traffic jams during the rush hours during the day , I believe these problem will be solved in the near future , because the car manufacterers are inventing new-concept cars which cover less areas and without any carbon dioxide emission .
These cars will definetely attacts more people to buy .

Fourth .
pocessing a private car can have more privacies which a lot of people concern about .
In the public transportation , your behavior is limited .

To all of these factors , cars have a lot pf advantages , people in the future will more likely to choose their own car rather than taking the public transportation .
So i believe that there will be more cars in use than there are today .
Of course , I will buy a car for my self in the near future .
