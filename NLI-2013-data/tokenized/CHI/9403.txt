I agree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Just like math , ideas and concepts are processes and answer is facts .
I think most of the teacher would like students to understand solve problem 's process not understand what the answer is .
If you have right process for the problem but get wrong answer that teacher suppose give you point , if you get right answer but your process not correct that will let your teacher doubt you `` how did you get this answer ? ''
Understand process that would easier to know how to solve the problem but know the answer ca n't sure you know how to solve problem .

It is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
Facts are dead , ideas and concepts are living .
Fact always have one but you may have the other thinking in the mind for your ideas or concepts and if you study deeply , it may overthrow original facts .
That why understand ideas and concepts is more important for learn facts .

Sometimes learning ideas and concepts can make you easier to understand , we can find something trick among them .
What is your thinking , your concepts or your ideas , like math have many of way to solve problem not just one .
