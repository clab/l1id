I support the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I hold this believe because cars have already caused too many damage to the environment and use a lot of natural resources , hence they will be eventually superseded by other highly environmental friendly transportation tools .

Let 's look at first what cars have brought with us over the decades : pollutions , trafic accidents , waste of irons and used up of oils etc .
Those negative effects have already impact our life a lot .
Such as people will loose their best friends or relatives during a trafic accidents .
More importantly , the negative espect also impact our enrionments .
We all know that the worlds becoming warmer and warmer , while one primary factor contribute to the global warming is the excessive immission of gasses used by millions of cars everyday etc .
This harmed our world 's air and damaged the environment .
Consider all these negative impacts , there are voices that already recommend to ban the production of cars .

Further more , twenty years later , as producing more cars will turn out to be not realistic because of the tightier resource constraints , people will stop producing cars and turn to produce other transportation tools .
Given the rapid technology improvement , I stronly believe that cars will be finally superseded with another more advanced transportation tools .
This can be true after sentific researches and many experiments .
Imgine a life that we can go anywhere via jet planes that similar like the situation just as dipicted in the fiction film .
Then , our life will be totally different as what we are today .

In conclusion , twenty years from now on , I belive that there will be fewer and fewer cars in use than there are as of today as a combined efforts of sentists and the publics .
Lets cross our figure to wish the environment of the world , the dearest place that we live together , can be better and better after our mutual efforts for example to find other transportation tools that are more environmental friendly than cars !
