Given the argument between agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years , chich one do I choose ?
It is believed that the answer is negative .
However , I totally agree with that cars will be fewer in twenty years later .
There are three reasons presented as followed .

To begin with , it is in terms of the environmental protection that the pollution of transporation , especially cars , are worse than before .
For example , because of the price of cars are getting cheaper than before , they casued more air pollution .
Therefore , the environmental problems of the earth , such as acid rain , global warming , depletion of ozone layer , will get more serious , so that draw more attention to countries in the wolrd to safeguard the natural environment .

What is more , it is rapidly developed technology that the public transportation are more convinient and cheaper .
Moreover , the technology of transportation are growing so fast that we have more alternative ways to choose .
For instance , if we want to visit some beautiful scenery , we can use airplan , metro-transportation , bus instead of driving cars .
In fact , the alternative transportations are more convinient and faster that can save our time and money .

Most important , it is decreasing the supplement of fossil fuels that according to the human excessively exploit the natural resources .
In other words , fossil fuels , such as petroleum , gas , are limited in natural world .
In addition , the price of these fules are getting higher and the expense of driving cars are considerably increased .
As a result , there will be fewer cars in use in few years later .

To sum up , I definitely agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for several reasons , among them based on the environmental protection , rapidly developed technology , and decreasing the supplement of fossil fuels .
