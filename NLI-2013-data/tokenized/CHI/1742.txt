I really agree with this opionion .

What I study now is the technology of electricity .
But what I should learn not only this thing .
I should learn maths , physicals , computer and a lot of other things .

At first , I do n't know why I should learn it , then I know it .
If I was asked to figure out something about the power of electricity , I should use maths , and how the electricity move , I also need the knowledge about the power and other tings .
Sometimes I need some special computer programmes to figure it , then I should write these programmes by myself .
The more borad knowledge of other academic subjects will help me the better in my specific subject .

Not only in my experiences , I also think almost all learners would agree it .
Beacuse nothing is exist in one theroty alone .

Here is a very simple example : when an apple fall dowe from the tree .
This phenomone support on a lot of things .
Such as why it leave the tree , why it fall down , how fast it fall down ...
All these different questions need different subjects to answet it .

And also , board knowledge of many academic subjects will help us see a question in different way .

Also there is a simple example : also there is an apple .
It become smaller and lighter everyday .
You cant find any reason of that in botantical or physical subjects .
But you will know why if you have learned chemcial .
Beacuse the water cells in the apple get outside , so you can kown well why it become smaller and lighter everyday .

Everything in the world needs broad knowledges .
The more we learned , the better we can kown the world .
This is my opinion of board knowledge of many academic subjects .
You will find interest in a lot of knowledge .
