I personally agree with the statment about the advertisement , which says `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''

As time goes , the number of the firms in the market is constantly incresing , and those firms are competing with one another in order to survive in the market .
Since they want consumers to buy their products , they are making so many creative advertisements .
That is why there are flooding advertisements in the newpaper or television .
But I think it is unfortunately true that the new copies advertisements thesedays are more like alluring the consumers eyes , preventing the consumer from making the right decisions , as they are losing their originally meaning which is providing the usefull information .

As other consumers of the modern society , I have experienced it in so many ways in my everyday life .
When I was in the primary school , I dreamed about having the human-sized Barbie doll .
My desire was basically coming from the advertisement in which a girl and a huge barbie doll were dancing together and putting makeups on each others faces .
The advertisement was saying that the barbie doll can play with a little girl , moving however the girl wished it to move .
Since I did not have any sister , I really wished I could have had such a doll with which I could dance and play .
Of course I did not think about the exaggeration of the advetisements , neither did my mother .
One day my mom ened up buying me that huge doll , but I could not do anything I imagined I could do with the doll .
The overall advetisement was exaggerating , and the doll was not even be able to stand by itself .
Relatively , my disappointment was great .

Not only as a consumer , I experienced the exaggeration of the advertisement but also as a producer .
When I was in middle school , the student government where I belonged to desperatively needed money for the upcoming school festival .
So we decided to sell some toys which we purchased from the local Dollor Tree .
But later on , I was greatly disappointed at the school student government when I witnessed the exaggerating advertisement copy we had to make , because none of the copies was hesitating to mention that the toys were from the luxiourious toystore , which was not true .

From my experience , I learned that the copy of the advertisement is hardly revealing the truth .
I think it is quite understandable becuase I know how hard it is to sell something for a seller while it is competing with other sellers .
But I still cannot agree with that one can buy something only considering what the advertisement says , because I know the advertisement is relatively supposed to be quite exaggerating .
