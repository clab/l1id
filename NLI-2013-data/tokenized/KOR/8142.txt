I think it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .
Students need basic knowledges first .
Furthermore , students will use knoweldges more often rather than only ideas or concepts .
Finally , it will be easier to understand ideas and concepts when the students have enough knowledge and facts .

First of all , students should be logical first .
Students are on the proccess of being mature and completed .
Humans will not become mature or knowledgeble if they do not learn facts .
In my opinion , a person get sufficient facts an Second , students will use knowledges more often rather than use ideas or concepts .
For example , there are lots of assignments which the students are required to do .
The most of assignments are about researching and analyzing something .
Even if a student who is lack of facts knows many ideas and concepts , he will not get high marks .
It is a very obvious fact .
Not only in the school , but also in the future when he get a job and work in the company without facts and knowledges , he will get into troubles .

Finally , when they have sufficient knowledge and facts , they can understand ideas and concepts easily .
For instance , a student tries to understand a concept of democracy .
If he has knowledge about democracy , it will be much easier to learn what is democracy .

Therefore , that learning facts is much more important for students rather than understanding ideas and concepts .
It is due to the fact that students need knowledges first , that knowing facts will be much more usefull rather than understanding ideas .
Also , when they have enough facts and knowledges , it is easy to understand concepts and ideas .
I do not mean that ideas and concepts are unconditionally wrong .
However , facts will be more usefull when the students complete their projects or when they work in the society in the future .
