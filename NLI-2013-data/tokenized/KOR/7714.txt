But to second type of people , it is very helpful if with a guide who know those places well .
In vacation , I usually take a trip to somewhere alone or in a group .
Two kinds of trips have their own good points .
For example , if someone needs to take a rest while he travel , I want to suggest to take a trip alone .

But a travel with a guide have their programs and time table for trip .
That means people have to follow the guide even though they need a time to take a rest and they have to move even though they wants to stay more in some places .
