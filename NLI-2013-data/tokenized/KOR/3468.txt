Many people have different opinions on whether young people nowdays do not give enought time helping their communities .
In my pionion , most students does not spend time helping their society .
Fist , the students does not like to help their communities .
Second , most of tem does not have enought time .
I will explain detail .

To begin with , young people spend time computer gameing .
As long as the Internet is developed , they are iterested in the game of computer .
Let me take my experence as an example .
My school all together go to the federal organization for poor people .
However , I have not helped poor people alone .

Next , young people will not have enough time to helping the poor people of their society .
This is beacause our countrys ' young people is busy to study hard .
Also their school also want to damage by spending time helping their communities .
They may be think that they should devout their all time for their study .

As I mentioned above , young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The students does not like to help their society and they does not have enough time to helping the poor people of their society beacause of their study .
