People can choose between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .
Some people prefer that studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learning the academic subject of one specific subject provides narrow knowledge with people .
However , I strongly prefer that studying the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because it strenthens people 's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .

First of all , I prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learing environments .
Learing many academic subject needs a lot of time .
Moreover , if some academic in many academic subjects is not interesting to people , then the environment discouages people 's studying ability For example , according to the study by one of the most famous professor Dr. Kim in Republic of Korea , 68.9 % of people like learing one exciting academic subject because it makes people 's good studying circumstances .
In this sense , I would rather that specializing in one specific subject because it strengthens people 's exciting studying circumstances .

In addition , I would rather studying the academic subject of one specific subject because future occupation needs professional knowledges .
Our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher , nurse and doctor .
These occupations have a special technique to do their works .
For instance , in my case , the computer programmer needs special knowledges such as coding Java languages , C languages and C++ language .
These knowledge can aquire efficiently only in computer science academic subject .
In this sense , I would rather that learning the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .

In conclusion , I definitely prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it intensifies people 's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .
