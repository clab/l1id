There are different opinions regarding whether adolescents recent days do n't give enough time in helping their communities .
Although it is true that there are a lot of examples of young people shown on television or mentioned on internet that gives a lot of helps to the community they are involved in , in my opinion teenagers do n't have enough time to give any hand to their communities as well as no wills to help the community .
In this essay I will briefly give reasons supporting my opinion .

Most of all , the adolescents nowadays are all confused and complicated in their communities as to the quickly changing society .
What I mean by this is that , although some children may have thoughts to help their communities but that they are not capable as to the lack of time they have .
Modern day requires students to spend more time in schools and also to go to institutions for extra work .
Even for small young nursery kids and significantly more for the teenagers , their parents want more and more from their children .
Some students suffer from masses of work due to school , institutions and sometimes private tutors .
They do not have time to give support for their communities .
Further more , as to this busy life they have they lose power to help their society .
After spending a hard time in school .
the institution , a private tutor and finishing their day with neverending home works on their desk , they will be absolutely exausted out by the end of the day .
It is obvious for those students to feel less tempted and enthusiased in giving support for their communities .

Moreover , young people in modern days are more likely to be selfish than those in the olden days .
As I mentioned above their are lots of students who work extremely hard , some who prefer to work hard nd some who are forced to work hard .
However in either way the competition among adolescents has increased dramtically .
I am not saying that there was no competition at all before , but there were truelly less tension among friends and less silent fights among them .
And the changes of this in the society had made the young people more selfish , less understanding , not caring of others in order to survive in this terrifying world , so they have this thinking that helping others will get them down from surviving in the world .
In addition , the parents also gave a great impact on adolescents ' personality , characteristics and behaviours .
In modern days a significantly increasing number of parents nearly obey their children .
They do anything what their child asks and wants , and as to this children are more likely to turn out to be selfish and think that they are the best in the world and that they are not to give any help to other people but to be loved and helped from the others .

As to the reasons I mentioned above , it is difficult for young people nowadays to give enough time to help their communities since they lack time and physical strength to support them and also changes in their personality as to the changes of the whole world and their outer effects such as parents .
Therefore in my opinion it is not adolescents nowadays do not give a lot of amount to support to their own society .
