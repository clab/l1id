I dissagree with the opinion that the way to travel in group led by tour guide .
In addition , traveling alone gives you more benefits .

First of all , traveling alone gives you much freedom .
You can go every place where you want .
Tour guide has a certain schedule .
So visitors have to follow the schedule even if they want to see in same place where thy are .
In my case , I went to china with guide .
We have many schedules in a day .
If we arrive at one place , guide said , `` Get off bus and I will give you 1 hour to travel here , after one hour , let 's see in front of this bus . ''
At that time I feel I am just like a machine and child .
One of the reason that people want to travel is having a relax in a comfortable place with freedom .
Travel with guide takes my freedom in traveling .

Second , traveling alone gives you more time to think .
If you travel with group and guild , you feel happy in a new place with many lovely people ( family , friends , girl/boy friends ) .
Feeling sympathy with people who you love in new palces is very good thing .
But it might reduce to have personal place and time .
Because you should follow busy schedule in a goupe with guide .
For example , I went to Australia alone and Tailnand with my friends and guid .
Feeling in these two travel is very different for me .
In Australia , I felt lonely in every night and thouht my families and friends .
So I realized that they are really important people in my life .
Also , I had much time to think my future. ` what I want to do , what I like to do . '
Finally I had got some results in that part .
On the other hands , traveling Tailand with friends and guide is just for fun .
We had great time there .
We did swiming for whole day , ate delicious foods and did shopping .
It was fantastic but just for fun .

For this reasons , I recommand traveling alone to my friends .
I think traveling along not with group led by a tour guide is better choice .
