Nowadays , there are many kinds of transportation for mankind .
Trains , bicycles , motocycles , airplanes ...
etc. and most common method of transportation above all is car .
Nowadays , almost each one of us has at least one car which he or she possesses .
And as the population increases on and on , the number of cars in use would increase on and on .
But due to the development of technology in our world , and growing awareness of people towards the environment they live in , I believe that in twenty years of time , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly , cars have contributed to lots of pollution going on around our world .
People are agressive beings .
They will try to eliminate all the factors that can pose threat to their lives .
So , if cars give off too much pollutants to the environment people are living in , people will try to find a substitute for cars in future .

Secondly , people are becoming more concerned about their health and the environment around them than they used to be in the past .
Now , after having put lots of damages to the environment , people are trying to conserve the environment again and trying to find a way to get rid of the pollutions they have created .
That 's why people are trying to use more environmental friendly method of transportations and use public transportations to reduce the pollution going on .
If this trend continues on , in twenty years time , less people will use cars as their main source of transportation and try to find another solution and use less cars in the future .

Thirdly , the reason why people use cars is to be more convenient when they are moving .
Driving cars is more convenient than walking , running , or driving a horse .
People have developed many ways to make these improvements during the past .
Mankind have made an enormous development in the past history .
As the time goes on and on , people will try to invent a new way of transportation which will make them more convenient and less time taking than now .
Even now , airplane has been invented and is becoming more popular than it used to be in the past becuase it is less time consuming and more comfortable than a car .
So , with regards to this characteristic of mankind , there is no reason why people will not invent a new method of transportation and abandon using cars as their main method of transportation .

The aggressive nature of human beings , growing awareness of importance of natural environment , and development of technologies to meet people 's desires to live a more convenient and less time consuming life will probably reduce the numer of cars used in twenty years from now .
People are always trying to make improvements in their lives .
So , if they are more concerned with having a better life than they have now , they will try to find a way to do so under any circumstances .
