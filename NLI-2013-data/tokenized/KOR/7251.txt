In my opinion , traveling world with group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money .
First of all , while they give you time to explore places , it 's a time very short time , so you miss out on lots of things that is necessary .
Secondly , Crumped in a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just is n't a fun thing to do .
Finally , some tour guides do n't even know what they are talking about , and do n't talk when they are suppose to , so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date .

Let 's say that you went to an University of Harvard , and they have lots to see like the science center , and famous people who graduated in that place like Bill Gates .
So the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place .
So while you are looking at unnecessary things , time goes by , and you miss out on the importants things like the golden statue .
Also if you do n't make it in time for the bus , they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute .

Eventhough , you go to places with your family or friends , they have lots of other people in the bus who is traveling with you .
You could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends .
But some people do n't care , because they also have Tv 's in the bus to entertain you , but it only entertains me a bit .
Then all you here is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you .
You ca n't tell them to be quite , because they will point fingers at you and even curse you .
The other things are that if you want to sleep , and lean back your chair a bit , they complain to you how unfortable it is which is very annoying .

The Great Wall of China .
It has lots of history and legens to it .
Surely , people want to know about it , but the tour guide does n't even say a word about it , and even he talks aloud , he does n't know what he is saying .
Well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that , but if you pick the wrong time and date , you must face the consequences .

Therefor , i disagree with the statement .
First of all , the tour guide do n't give you the right timing for you to explore place .
Secondly , you barely know anybody in the bus except for people who came with you , and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus .
