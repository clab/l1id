There are controversy about importance between having a broad knoeledge of many academic subject and a specific subjcet .
As a matter of fact , I am following the opinion that having a broad knowledge is more important in modern society for two reasons .
Let me explain more precisely .
To begin with , knowing about lot of kind of fileds studies may increase tha ability of communication , which is thr most impotant key in the futuer world .
Humana have achived a great deal of development in each erasin own filed and that cause the miscommunication to each each other becaus the concpt are now reaaly hard to under stand easily .
So , word ` generalist ' and appeard instead od ` specialist ' contemporary society .
by make conncetion in spacial academic fileds they colud play a team work in various projects .

Furthermore , having a broad information can make a `` sinerge effect '' in a specific era .
If the knoweldge intergated with others , the benefits are not only double but triples , even increase inormously , and this ih the reason why trem `` sinerge effect. '' maked .
for that reason , many university is makig a joing coures for their reacherch as a ` inter-displinary ' purpose , and thorgh those kind of effort current stuy are gaining a great deal of accomplishments .
For exem \ mple As a graduate student , I am undergiong that method too .

On the whole , broad knoweldge can make more fluent social communications and make each specific subjects more power by connecting .
That makes cleare that it 's better to choose than a specific subject learing .
