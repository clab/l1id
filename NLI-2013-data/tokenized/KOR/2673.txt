As far as I am concerned , I think young people enjoy life more than seniors do .
There are two reasons to support this idea - health , and society .
First , young people are passionate and healthy .
Since they are healthier than older peole , they can more travel or do activites than older people do .
Older people get easily tired and need the rest , because of that , it takes much more time for seniors to travel or do activites while healthy young people do much more activities .
Also there are many activites that require a good health such as sky diving , soccer , and so on .
Since these activities are difficult for old people , they cannot do or enjoy these activities even though they really want to do those .
So there are many limitations to older people .
However , many young people with a great tenacity can enjoy aggresive activities and can do in a long period of time .

The other reason that young people can enjoy life more than older people do is society .
In society , there are many businesses making many entertainments .
The problem is that their targets are mostly young people , teenagers or ages of twenty to forty .
The reason is young people usually make money , however old people usually retired from their jobs and became unemployed .
For example , movie theaters , or amsement parks are usually noisy and are packed with a huge number of people which are the exact conditions that many old people do not like .
By time goes by , many companies emerges to the society and they produce many entertainments for young people , not old people .
Therefore , there are getting less things to enjoy for old people .

Some people may think that older people and young people equally have chances to enjoy their lives .
However , due to the fact that young people are healthier and more make money and society does not care for older people in entertaiments field , I think young people are likely to live in enjoyable lives .
