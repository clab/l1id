The statement , ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is telling us that , to success you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at .
I agree with the statement .
I think it helps to make something you are not really good and and make it one of the things you are good at .
It also make you experience many things and smetimes success , and sometimes fail .
That teach us what is right and what is wroge .

In your life , you have to try many things .
When you are a baby , you have to try oto get up and walk .
If you do n't start with that kind of risks , you will never walk , and not be like a normal person .
Taking risk might be something very diffecult .
It might also be very easy .
When you try something , you can like it , or yo9u can hate it .
It 's all your chose .
for example , this term , it tried for all the sport teams in school .
I thought I was really bad at basssket ball , but when I tarted the team , I figure out that I really liked it , and was actually beter than what I thought .
Making my self made me have a new hubby and try more to be better at it .

Tring and taking risks helps you to learn what is wright and what is wronge .
When you try , you sometimes success , and somtimes fail .
My dad told me that fail make you success more and help learn what to do next to not fail t \ at the same thing .
For exampel , my brother really liked tennis even though he did n't do it .
When he tried , he find out that he did n't like it at all .
From then , he did n't do tennis , and find out that one of his hobby was n't really his hobby .
In that case , he failed and also successed on what he tried .
He failed on guessing what his hobby was , but he successed in finding out what his really hobby was .

I think successful people alway try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It helps people to try and be good at something you tried .
It also makes you learn what is right and what is wrong and make you not do the mistake you did again when you do it again .
