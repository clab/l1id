I strongly believe that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is far more beneficial than the narrow view on specific subject .
There are several important reasons which undergird my position .

The first one is that the world is being complicated and interdisciplinary .
In other words , it is impossible to understand where the world is heading without the compound analysis on the various subjects .
The good example for this is bioengineeing .
In these days , the field of study , bioengineering , is getting more popular .
And its property can be defined as diversity and integrity of other various fields of the study .
It can be referred as a mountain , which is living and breathing .
All fields of engineering and science , such as Mechanical Engineering or biology , chemistry , gets together building mountain , bioengineering .
Inside it , the each fields interacts and synchronize with each other .
Without the ability which can have himself or herself understand other fields of study , they cannot participate in the interaction among fields and the living mountain cannot live anymore resulting in the collapse both personally and socially .

The second one is that broad knowledge on many academic subjects affects the individual life directly .
For example , if someone knows well about english with Mechanical Engineering major , he can teach others english as a part time job .
Also , the person who has broad band of knowledge on academic subjects can do things then others who do n't .
Someone with qualified foreign language can make connection between his or her company with others abroad .

The specialzed knowledge on one subject can make researcher deep well of study .
However , the depth of the well can be further by broader entrance of it .
The wider the entrance , the deeper the well goes .
To get their own major is , of course , important .
However , we should remember that broader knowledge can make our research more profounder and valuable .
It support strong base for your major .

Therfore , I prefer to arm with broad knowledge of many academic subfects than to specialize in one specific subject .
