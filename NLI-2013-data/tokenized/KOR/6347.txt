There are lots of perspectives and opinions about the number of cars in use in the future .
Some people think that we will have plenty of cars as the days are going by , however , I definitely think that we have fewer cars in our future than today .
I 'd like to represent my argument based on the three following reasons : the shortage of fuel , the mass transportation , and restrictions .

First of all , we are going to face the shortage of fuel .
As we know , cars definitely rely on fossil fuel such as oil and gas .
Without fuel , no cars can be moved and worked .
Current and future situation related to the shortage of fuel will lead us to hesitate to buy and produce new cars .

Furthermore , development in our science allows lots of countries to build well-developed mass transportations such as subway and express trains and convienent bus system .
Increasingly , people will prefer to utilize mass transportations rather than to drive their own car when shopping , going to work , and travelling .
Developed system in mass trasnsportation will casuse a revolutionary commuting habits to city dwellers .

Lastly , we are expecting governmental restictions on using cars in near future .
Currently in my home country , car drivers have to pay high tax and fee for causing trafffic jam and environmental burden .
Environemntalists strongly suggest that car producers and car purchasers have to pay more money for using car .
In addition , many people agree to the idea because they want to take clean air in .
Government has no choice but impose more fee and tax for using cars , and will create various way to prohibit car owners from using cars .

In short , I absolutely believe that we will have fewer cars on the road in near future based on the above-mentioned reasons .
Shortage of fuel and governmental restrictions will make drivers hesitate and at the same time , they will choose to take mass transportation .
