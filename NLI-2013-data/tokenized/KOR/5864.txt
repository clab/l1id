Some people might think that it will be disappear the number of cars within few years .
I do not agree with this idea because the car is good transportion to go somewhere and there is not significant trial as alternative cars .

First , I can say that the car is the best vehicle to go somewhere .
We usually use the car when we go some place .
Even though the distance is long or short , driving car is suitable for any distance .
For example , when I was in summer vacation , I went to 3 academies for learning English conversation and English writing and computer class .
Academies were so seperated that I needed to ride something .
At that time , my sister recommended me to ride a motor scooter .
Because it was cheap , I thought that to ride a motor scooter was a good idea .
It was not good idea at all because of long distance for a motor scooter .
I think that there is any vehicle that can replace the cars because I can drive any distance even though it is ten meters or five thousand meters .

Secondly , people rarely try to develop the new vehicle .
Press usually says that we are in the situation of lack of petroleum .
In this situation , most car companies try to find the alternative energy instead of gasolin .
For example , I visited a car company when I was middle school student as a school picnic .
In there , I could learn lots of information about cars and the source of energy .
The supervisor of that company told that cars were faced of shortage of energy .
In addition this meaned that we woud not make new transportation but find new energy .
It took hundreds years to make cars and it is too late to make new vehicle now .
That idea made people do not care about making new transportation for moving .
I agreed with his idea and I can feel that few exerts to made new vehicles for money .

I believe even though several years are passed there are still many cars .
Cars are the best way to move and people hardly try to make new ca
