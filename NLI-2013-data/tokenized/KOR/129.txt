I disagree with the statement , Nowadays , young people seems they do not give enough time to helping their communities .
but it is because the way of participating their communities is changing through time .
In the past , communities are so small that everyone in the community can know almost everything about other member in community , and they spent most of their time in the community .

But nowadays , communities are getting bigger and bigger , one member in community can hardly know about other member in community , and people spend more time at work than in community .

so , it may appear this statement is true .
But the willingness to help other people is not less than that of past time .
Some young people help other people by internet , donating disabled men 's committee and the other spend more time to helping their communities at work .
( work place can be a community . )

So , as time goes by , the way of participating community activity is just changing , not the willingness of participating community activity .
