Nowadays , in Korea , I think many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Instead , they spend their time on their own tasks .
I 'd like to give you some of examples of young people in Korea .

The first example is that many young people say that they are helping their communities .
They claim that they go to orphange or public places such as post office or police station in order to help their communities .
Actually , they are not going to the places in order to contribute to society .
They volunteer in fake in order to get scores or fulfill the time required to go to high school or colleges .
If the required time of volunteering is fulfilled , they do not volunteer any more .

The second example is that , in Korea , when a social matter occured , many young people protested against it and they continually protested until it was improved .
However , nowadays , most young people are ignorant of the social matters .
They only pay attention to their own .
Because of that , there are many social problems unsolved throughout the country .

Though the some young people are really spending time on helping communities , most of the young people do not help their communities .
They only do their tasks .
They do not give much attention to their societies .
I think the main reason for this is that the ` Individualism ' which was spread to young people from European countries or America .

We , Koreans , should follow our tradition , which put a lot of emphasis on helping communities .
If we behave like this , our country cannot develp well .
If we want to make a better country , we , young people should spend some time helping to the communites .
These kinds of activities may not be hard .

We can pick some trashes scattered in the streets or we can help disabled people in the road .
We can give some of our money to poor people or we can visit hospitals or people in need once in a week .
These might be not tough .
Instead of spending time on ourselves , we can help communities with those kinds of acitivities .
Through our efforts , we can make a better world .
Help communities !
