People have their own ideas about whether they concentrate on the broad sujects or not .
Some people may say that we have to study special subject for developing speciality .
In my opinion , however , it seems clear that learning many subjects is more important than the sepcific subject because of selection and relation of job .

First , when it comes to the selection of job , knowing a lot of fields enables people to have many options which they select jobs .
It is generally agreed that if we study more subject , we would gain more items of considering occupations .
For example , in my case , I majored in environment and I am soldier , in other words , I studied environment as major and explained army skill .
Therefore , I can select my future whether I would be a soldier or environmentalist .
Moreover , if people have so many selection , they would fail to live in their life .
Therefore , the so many selection have positive effect on studentrs .

Second , as far as relation of jobs is concerned , some jobs are relative to other jobs , People have the common sense that math is similiar to physics , science , engineering and so on .
Therefore , all subects are relative to any other subjects and we can say that the some occupations also similiar to other jobs .
For instance , if people want to be a computer specialist , they should understand engineerinig workers and investors and also know math , science , engoneer and so on .
In other words , computer science involve in engineering , math , science and other fields .
Furthermore , in the companies , persons who work at same corporation have each major and they have influence on each other .
Therefore , they must know respective fields for developing their company .
In this way we can say that we must understand many fields .

To sum up , I agree with the statements in that we had better gain more knowledges from learning lot of subjects .
If we study many academic subjects , we can obtain so many benefits , All things considered , I can definitely say that we must study many subjects .
