I disagree with the statement .
I think it is more important to focus o one specific subject which you are interested in and make it to your major skill .
You have to be the best on the subject you chose to gain success .
There are some examples to prove that one good specific subject is much helpful than broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .

I have two uncles .
One was very good at business and another was just normally good at all the subjects .
Later on , an uncle who was very good at business chose his major skill to business and study deeply in business .
Finally , he graduated very good business university and got a good position in a company .
On the other hand , an uncle who was adequately good at all the subjects could n't make good choice to decide his major skill .
He majored English but his English was not as good as those people who focuses on only English .
Therefore , he is now just a normal teacher in an English acadamy .
As a result , the uncle who was good at only one specific subject seemed to have better life in the future .

Another example is about a famous soccer player called Ronaldo who is the best soccer player .
Ronaldo is only good at soccer .
He is n't good at math , business and other things .
He only practiced soccer from when he was young .
As he tried to do best on his job and focused on only soccer , he finally became best of it .
Since he became best of well known sport , he got wealth and fame at the same time .
If he tried to do other sports also , he surely wo n't be in the position he have in present time .

As a result , to be a best on the subject you chose is very important .
People will always look for the person who is best at their subject because they are sure the person is good at the subject .
When you become the best at a certain subject , you will gain wealth and fame at the same time as Ronaldo did .
Therefore , try to find something that interests you and do your best to make it your major .
