I believe older people enjoy their lives as much as young people do .
Even though many people consider energetic and passionate young people tend to enjoy their lives much more than older people , I can see many old people who love their lives and are content with their current lives with great happiness in tranquil peace .
My grandparents , for example , enjoy their days and make themselves busy through participating in voluntary works and travels .

My grandparents retired three years ago from their workplaces .
After quitting their jobs , they tried to find new voluntary works in order to keep themselves busy and enrich their lives .
As a volunteer at a local hospital , my grandmother worked to help people to get direction because the big hospital has a quite complex structure .
Meeting new people and kindly helping strangers to the hospital are her jobs , and she really enjoys doing it .
My grandfather , on the other hand , found a voluntary position at a local thrift store .
He rearranges new coming donation goods and helps the workers at the share-thrift store .
Since many people use the store , he is busy and he told me he wanted to share his ability to work with the society where he belong to .

Last summer , my grandparents took a trip to Egypt .
Since they had already retired , they were free from the duties from their workplaces and able to arrange their dates without any concerns .
Now they can fully enjoy their trips .
My grandparents were eager to visit one of the ancient civilization places , Egypt , and experience the exotic landscapes and trees in the Middle East .
They showed me their pictures in front of pyramids with excitements on their faces .
They rode cammels in the middle of the bleak desert , and met Egyptian people !
They are planning to take a trip to Thailand next summer and I can read the excitements on their faces .

Young people 's life can be full of new adventures and challenges in business , while old people 's life is peaceful and graceful , which is free from any hurry or heavy responsibilities .
My grandparents told me they could enjoy and realize their true value of life through getting involved in their community without profits .
When they were young , they did not know something meaningful in their lives because they were too busy working to earn money .
But they told me they were enjoying their lives more than when they were young .
While I was watching their happy faces and contentments , I believe old people enjoy their lives even more than young people do .
