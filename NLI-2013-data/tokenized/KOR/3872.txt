I agree with it .
Nowadays young people are changing .
They just think about them selves .
Internet and minings are changing so made them to think about them selves .
Why I said Internet makes us change is , in Internet we are allowed to do everything and have own worlds .
We have own hompies blogs so we can get happiness from decorating thosese , and watching what they made .
In Internet nobody cares , no one know who I am , so we can do whatever we want .

Consequently we ca n't think about others , because we have many things to do for them selves .
So we dont give times time to helping their communities .
But I thing helping their communities are more vaulable then decorating , or having fun in unreal world .
I think we should get more interst in communicates .
