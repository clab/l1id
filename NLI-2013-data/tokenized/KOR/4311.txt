I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is because the current society seems to promote active community services in many areas and encourage young people to get involved in community services by suggesting attractive rewards by doing that .

To start with , most schools requires certain tasks of community services in school activities .
I personally experienced this when I was in highschool in Sydney .
I and my friends are regulary sent to certain institutions or places that need help .
Thus we had to spend two hours a week in evey year helping our communities .
Furthermore , it is now became compulsory for all students to spend certain amount of time helping communities in order to graduate middle school and high school in Korea .
Therefore , it can be said that young people spend enough time to helping their communities whethere they want or not .

Secondly , community services do help young people enter a college or get a job .
Most colleges and companies gives extra scores if a candidate have numerous experience of community services .
In other words , more and more young people desire to help their communities in order to enter colleges or get a job .

In short , I strongly believe that young people spend enough time to helping communities in these days .
In fact , it seems that the society force young people to participate in community services more rather than vonluteer themselves .
But this phenomenon cannot be blamed because young people nowadays seems that they becomes more selfish than ever before .
Therefore , in which way they contribute to helping communities , it is true that young people spend enough time to help thei
