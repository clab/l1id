I agree with the statement .
In Korea , all the highschool students work on only studying .
Also their parents force to them study .
As a result , all the students lose time to help their communities .
They do not even help their family .
Most of Korean lives in apartments .
Once upon a time , everyone knew all the members in their town , and there was not someone who do not know in their town , because they always cared about their neighborhoods .
However the apartment do not give any chance to meet their neighborhoods .
One more , the jobs are getting more proffesional .
Everyone engage in different part of jobs .
So they do not have chance to think about their neighrhoods and communities .
So the reasons i think are studying , apartment and proffesionalizing of jobs .

First of all , the studying culture made students do not help their communities .
In highschool , all the students compete eachother so badly , they do not have anytime to think their communities .
They will have to go to academies after school , and they will be so tired .
After the academies , they will fall asleep right after arriving at home .
This culture make this society like that .

Second , living in apartments is one of the reasons .
Apartment is a seperated place .
All the people do not care about their neighbors and do not know who are their neighrborhoods .
The apartments are getting so big , and they will not remember who are the neighborshoods .
Then no one will help each other , because they do not know each other .
This is big problem of apartment .

Third , I think proffesionalizing of jobs is the biggest reason .
Originally , people engaged on same work in Korea .
Everyone growed crops .
The agriculture was developed in Korea , so they always helped eachother .
However , these days , everyone has different jobs .
So they will help only people who are in their companies .
Neighborhoods will not have any chance to meet each other .

Helping communities is really important to live this society .
If we need help , no one will help us .
We need to help each other and make good realationship with all the people in our communication and society .
