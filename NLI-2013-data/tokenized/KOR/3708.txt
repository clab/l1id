Nowadays , Many people put much emphasis on the importance of helping each other .
In sptie of the importance of helping each other , some people told that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
However , I disagree this opinion .
Rather , I think young people have much more time to helping their communities than before .
I 'll explain my opinion this following reason .

The first reason I think young people have much more time to help their communities is the change of education policy which put much emphasis on the social wellfare activity .
Todays , the education authority , or Ministry of Education ( hereby referred to as `` MOE '' ) puts much more emphasis on social wellfare activity than ever before through `` the Education Reformation Plan '' .
In this plan , the MOE recommed that each school teach its students to envolve actively in the social well-fare activity .
The best example of this plan is to help elderly and clean the street .
To fulfill the requirement of social wellfare activity which gives enough credit to apply the University , Many young people have much more time to help their communities than ever before .

The second reason is the advent of internet age .
As you are well aware of , the internet has `` INTERACTIVE '' charateristic .
Today .
many online community prosper in the internet world , The best example is `` Sy-World '' or '' Friend Society '' .
In this internet community , there are many activities to help social communities .
Young people have more time to construct clean and sound society through suggest their opinion on the internet site .
Sometimes , they check the behavior of Congressmen to make clean political environment .

In conclusion .
I think young people nowadays have more time to helping their communities .
I think the change of education policy which emphasize the importance of helping their communities and the prosperous of internet community which envoles major social issues is the main reason that young people have enough time to helping their communities .
