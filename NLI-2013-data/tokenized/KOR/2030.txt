Youth is the most precious of time in Life

I totally believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Yong people have proper physical conditions to enjoy outdoor sports , passinate to learn uncertain areas and they are more open minded to the world .

First of all , physically young people have better conditions than older people .
For example , young people can enjoy outdoor sports such as bungy-jumps , skydivings and mountain climings .
Even though older people eagar to join thoes things their body is not able to work out it .

Second of all , young people passinate to learn something new .
When they notice something unfamilliar things they are curious about it and study or learn them becase they have a passion to do something new .
For example , when I , 26 femal , heard web 2.0 at the first time , I tried to find out what is the web 2.0 and how can i adjust that .
If i am old , I may not be concern about web 2.0 .

Last but not least , young people are more open minded than older people .
Usually , older people have many experiences through their whole life that they might have full of fixed ideas .
It means that for them nothing is fresh that they cannot enjoy every moment .
However , young people are more easy to make new friends , less fixed idea about politics , people and histories .
Open mind is one of the most important material to enjoy life .

In my conclusion , even older people have their own joyment of life , young people could enjoy life better than older people .
Young people have full of passions , open minded and they have perfect physical conditions to enjoy life as long as they are young .
