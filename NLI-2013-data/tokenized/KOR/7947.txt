I really agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Traveling along while plnning it by oneslef looks fun .
However , we may disadvantage about economical , safe , and psychological points .

Traveling not by a group tour may challengable because we have to decide everything by ourselves .
Planning a travl will be fun and we will have a different taste from the group travel for their own design .

However , it can be kind of waste of time and money .
Usually , the group tour by a tour guide is cheaper for the larege number of a group and the guider will have enough of information around the area .
It is out of question that the company of guiding a tour has a good capacity of information .

Another issue can be safty .
Going new place for a tour can carry along crimes .
One guy who travels to Spain , for an example , was stolen a camera in a train .
He realized that it happens so often in this area for the foreign tourist later .
If he travels in a group , such a bad luck will happen rarely .

The most valuable thing of tour is giving a good relief to people .
They can forget their normal life and relieve their mental stress while in tour .
If they plan for their town tour , it will be stressful .
I heard that a couple who goes for a tour had a big trouble between them because they found some difficult issue in travel and got stress .

As I mention above , planing for a tour by oursleve looks wonderful .
But , we will spend more money , time and in dangerous with lack of information .
Moreover , we will still in a stress while in a tour for the relife of mental .
