Everyone loves to want be successful people .
That is why there is a big debate about wether people can get success things .
Naturally , some people feel that we try new things and take riske .
However , in my opinions , doing what they already know how to do well is necessary .
There are a few reasons why I hold this view .

To begin with , It is professional .
What I mean is that they konw very well compare the other persons .
For exampel , if cardiologist want to take care of pediatric patients , Is it a good way ?
As you can see , When they want to success their works or job , they have to do what they already know how to do well .

Another thing , we must considers effective factors .
In other words , When someone try new things , It is time-consuming .
Take divers as an example .
If tax drivers try drive buses or truck , they have to learn how to do it .
Also , they have to get this licences .
They aleady have know-how .
They already know how to do well therefore essential for success .

Taking a look at the other perspective , of course may people consider refresh and change their mind .
That is to say , When people can do work for a long time , they can get manersim .
However , If they give motivation or change life style , you can get more adventages .

Thus , we must do waht we know how to do well .

Taking all things into considerations , I feel strongly that only doing what they know how to do well is a great idea .
The main reasions are professional and effective .
Do you still think that successful people try new things and take risks ?
