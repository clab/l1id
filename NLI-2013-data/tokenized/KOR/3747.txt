It is debatable that teenagers , these days , put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help thier communities because they are belonged to a wide range of groups and those groups participate in helping communities .
In contrast , I strongly believe that students do not spend their time to helping their communities because they not only focus on more difficult exams , but also tend to become selficient .

First of all , these days , a lot of difficult exams or tests make students spend more time .
Young people study hard to enter more prestigious universities .
Thus they focus on studying rather than helping their communities .
According to reserch of Chosun-ilbo , one of the leading newspapers in Korea , a number of students who give the seats to the elder or visit the orpanage or silver house .
The reserch demonstates that 70 % students respond that they do not have enough time to think about other things , instead of studying .

On top of that , teenagers do not think other people whether they are poor or not .
They have tendency of selfcient .
In the past , many students consider their communities when communities have special party or festival for reconition of communities , so they frequently help install tools or stages .
The best example of this is that my father help making stages of the rural festival of harvesting .
He said that at that time , most students who lived in thier communities gave the their hands in order to succeed the festival .
On the other hand , when our communities have beach festival every summer , even though our communities ask help assistance , no students emerged the cite to install stages , hence the festival failed .
In this respect , at present , students are selficient compared to the past .

In conclusion , young people do not spend enough time to giving thier hands for communities .
The reasons are the stuends concentrate studying more to enter the better universities , and teenagers are more selficient that the past .
All in all , a substantial nmber of students study at home , even though the our communities want to need the assistants of teeanagers .
