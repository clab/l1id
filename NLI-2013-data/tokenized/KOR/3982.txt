Recently , some criticism has been raised regarding the little interest of young people in helping their communities .
However , I do not agree with it and think young people are still playing an important role in helping their communities .

First , they do a lot of volunteer works .
Every spring and fall when the farmers are busy planting seeds or harvesting crops , many college or university students are seen to make volunteer groups to give them a little help .
Furthermore , a great number of highschool and middleschool students are taking in part in helping orphans or disabled people .

Secondly , young people attribute greatly to the community economy even if they do n't know they 're or do n't intend to .
They 're the main consumers in the shops which is why so many brands have young people as their prior targets .
They 're also the main passengers for a lot of public transportations .
While many adults tend to drive ther car to work , young people use buses or taxis to go to school .

Thirdly , thorough demonstrations , young people keep the community in a good direction .
They protest against unequal treatments or improper administrations .
These help the community habitants make sure that nothing unfair should be happened in their community .

For the formentioned reasons above - young people do a lot of volunteer works , help the local economy , and have the community aware of improper things through demonstrations - I think that young people are doing their jobs in helping our community a better place to live .
