It is said that the society has turned so busy and competing , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This observation is not fully incorrect , but it is a rather shallow approach .
One must see what young people actually plan to do and the way they do it to understand the phenomenon .

Since the competition in the society has increased sharply , young people these days have much more to do when they are not working than the young ones even as close as some decades ago , so they usually study and prepare to get jobs .
This is why it seems that young people do not give enough time to halping the society .
However , that is not all they do .
There are many voluntary acts that university students organize or participate on their own .
For example , Korean university and college students participate in education services organized by religious parties .
Moreover , these days they tend to organize the service by themselves .

The way of committing to the community also has changed .
Young people from an older generation might have been involved in more general issues , such as politics , or national social movements .
Young people nowadays , on the other hand , tend to specify on their specialties and focus on what they can do best , or at least on what they like .
As seen above , students tend to teach the children who have hard time at school but cannot afford any other education .
This trend goes into more specific areas .
Students will involve with communities close to their majors , and young workers will help those who are closer to personal interests or hobbies .
For example , students who major on agriculture will go on the fields and help farmers .
This will enhance their knowledge on their major as well as help the community that involves them .
Young workers interested in sports forming teams or coaching children for free will also be an example .

As a whole , young people these days surely do not seem to give enough time to helping the community , but they sure do so in their own ways .
It is only the outside that has changed due to the increased complexity and competition of the society , not the inside of the young peoples minds and souls .
Their ways might have changed , but they still do like any other generation might .
