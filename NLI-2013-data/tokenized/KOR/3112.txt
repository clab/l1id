Some people may think that young people can enjoy their life more than older people while others think that older people can really enjoy their life without restraint .
I disagree to the idea that young people can enjoy their life than older people because of time constraint , insufficient money matters and a sort of the burden such as study or job .

First , young people generally do n't have enough money excluding small number of fortunate people .
Especially in the case of young students , they have to get the money from the parents or make money by working as a part-time jot .
In order to enjoy the life , it takes a lot of money .
For example , many young people would choose traveling as a way to enjoy the life .
To buy airplane ticket or driving car need fair amount of money .
Therefore , since the young people cannot afford to pay for travel cost , they cannot enjoy their life to their wish .

Second , young people are pressed to time .
In general , young people are students or worker .
It means they belong to the certain schools or workplaces .
In this sense , students are pretty much busy in keeping up with the course or school work and young workers should work on their job at their workplace .
For example , as a student , I have been always busy to do homework and I cannot imagine enjoying the life specially during the semester .
Therfore , because of the time constraint , young people have many limitations on enjoying themselves .

Third , young people have lots of burden or obligations compared to the older people , For instance , young couple who have two boys cannot relax themselves or enjoy themselves even when they have free time .
Taking care of the chilren and doing house chores can be on-going job for the young people in the stage of life .
Besides this , they have to support their children by making money .
Therefore , with the burden and obligation , young people who have family to raise cannot find time to enjoy themselves easily .

In conclusion , young people can be the generation to work rather than enjoy .
Enjoying onself needs , in general sense , money , time and freedom of any kind of obligation in life .
Considering the special nature of life style of young people , they seem to be more difficult to enjoy themselves than older people who are free of the burden for raising the children and then have enough time and money to enjoy .
