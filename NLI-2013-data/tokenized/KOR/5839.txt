I agree with the idea thinking the cars will be replaced with the better tools for transportation and more friendly to environment in the near future .

Cars are the most common transporation tool for the present years .
They are slower then flight but cheaper in cost , cheaper in cost then bicycles or whatever the vehicles manual forces should be put to operate but a lot faster and the cost is endurable for the common people comparing to flight fare .

However they have been issued with envormental concerns that the cars produce harmful substances to the nature such as air etc .
Of course in twenty years coming , people will try to invent the non harmful fuel to feed the cars for operation however I strongly believe the smart human beings , considered to be ` magic hands ' to invent whatever they need , olny the matter is the time , will get another brilient creation to satisfy the speed as plans , cost effective and also needs to be friendly to enviroment .

It may have a form of car-like appearance , however if you meant the cars with speed like today and causing concerns like they do today , I may expect the new creation or invention ( will be named differently with CARS ) to replace the cars today .

Let 's try to picture the things that have same look as cars nowadays but no wheels are flying here and there for common people 's daily transportation .
There will be no much heavy traffic in the road as there is now .
They are faster as planes and the fare is also endurable as I expect in the future , then not many people will be late for the jobs or classess being stuck in the traffic .

Also the concerns about pollution by cars will be relieved .

Some people might say twenty years are regarded to be too short for another stage of transportation system however , I reflected my little hope to have this ` mighty tool ' for my daily commuting to work in the near future in this writing .
