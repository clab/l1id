In our society , there are lots of confilct between facts and someone 's idea .
but i do not think the idea and concepts is more important than its facts for the several reasons .

As iam a citizen of Korean , sometimes we have to get bad un - benefit hearing for the history things .
and also it issue on now .
some country try to get our territory , they made thir country 's textbook of the school own their way .
it was really surprised to all citizen .
but they were saying it is true .
there are reason why did they said that becase , they also learn it like that way with that worng fact textbook .
we should teach our child with the fact .
therfore they can image somethinf with the fact .
without the fact , they will just keep make some non make sence stuff .

secondly , the person who does not have knowledge about the facts , they can not get any job .
in our society we are very think importantly abut one person 's knowledge .
and also the created idea coming form our knowledge of facts .
so many companies are hiring people who are intellegient .

lately , in our shcool , what are we learn about it ?
all subject like history , math , and english is all facts .
and we are also going into our community wiht that facts .
that is the way we live in here now .

Accordingly , there are some reason for why learning facts are more important than learning ideas and concepts .
through the all facts we can think more creatvity , and also we should solve that conflict between the facts and ideas or concepts .
if there are no fact , how do we lean on someone ?
we should realized what is facts and what is ideas .
if there are exact line between of them , the conflicts are not exist any more .
so i belive that the facts are more impotant than learning about the ideas and concept first .
