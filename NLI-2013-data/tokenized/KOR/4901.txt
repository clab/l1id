I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my point of view , I think all company does .
I think a lot of people could agree with this statement if they have their own experience of it .

Actually , the main goal of advertisements are make huge profit by selling the products .
To do this , they should make good image on the product , and the product should appear to a lot of people .
If it looks not good in the advertisement , people will not buy it .
So , this skill is very important to sell the product to the consumers .
Sometimes , people buy something without any information .
I think this is because the advertisement already bulit their nice image on people 's mind .
I have my own experien to support this .
When I was in my country Korea , I saw an advertisement of mini radio from famous company .
It looked really cool and useful to me , so I wanted to buy that mini radio .
It was brand new and it was much smaller than mine .
I always wanted to have small radio that I can bring everywhere .
I ordered that mini radio after I watched the advertisement on televison , and when I recieved that I was surprising .
It was not that small .
It was just ` little ' smaller than regular radio , however in the advertisement that I saw , it looked so small such as my little MP3 player .
I disappointed a lot and I gave that to my older brother .
After that mistake , I never order the peoduct just by advertisement .
Actually , it was not ` mini ' radio .
However , this could be require for the company because they need to make money .
I can understand their view , however sometimes it makes people disappoint about the products .

In conclusion , most advertisements make their peoduct looking better than they really are .
So , when we buy something , we should consider about it before make decision .
