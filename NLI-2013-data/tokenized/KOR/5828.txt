Some people believe that in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today .
In my opinion , however , more and more cars will appear .
Because car is very comfortable opts and people want their own car as the country is more developed .

Using car is very comfortable .
A lot of people can feel that .
As more developing internet and information , people knows many beautiful regions and want to go .
Of course , using car is only way to go anywhere , but car is the most convinient and the most comfortable .
For example , my family want to go cosmos festival that is advertised beautifully in one website .
there is very countyside so there are not public transportation .
So my family choose my father 's car .
Because of the car , all of my family members can enjoy the cosmos ( one species of fall flower ) festival .
This illustrates the importance of being easy when they use car .
Car is more and more increas as people look for their being comfortable .

Also , many young people want their own car as time goes by .
Young people , like college students are more known about date routes and place they enjoy in being not disturbed .
moreover , society is gradually private , so people want their private car , not their family car .
For instance , my boy friend wants to bring me to the east sea .
He said , people who have been east sea tell a story about beautiful scene .
I very want to go , but we have no car .
My father 's and his father 's cars are limited .
As a result , we gave up that nice plan .
After then , my boy friend and I always hope to have my own car .
This illustrates why people want to have their own car .

For these reasons , I think although time goes by , cars are more increasingly .
Car is very comfortable means and something like treasure for young people .
