Successful people in the history became famous and successful because they invented new things or they found out something that no one knew .
Those people did not just do it because they were very intelligent but their eager to experiment and really putting their ideas to action help them become successful and famous .
If one try new things , he will have more chance to find something new that will help the world to become better place which means successful .

Thomas Edison , inventor of light bulb , was very curious boy so he would be all over the place trying wierd things that no one every tried .
For example , one day his mom found him in their barn on the hays where chichens lay their eggs .
So his mom asked him was he was doing and he said he was keeping the eggs warm for the chicken .
That was the start of his curiousness .
He would try everything to solve his questions .
So he found the light bulb and the reputation made him successful and famous .

In the recent time , Steven Jobs , owner of the Mac , is one of the example who became famous by trying new things and taking the risks .
When he was in high school he was not interested in studying but he enjoyed working with machines .
So in young age , he started working with machines and computers .
His friend and Jobs tried to make their own computer but they could not get the perfect one in first time but taking a risk of getting money and criticisms from people around they finally made a personal computer .
So they named it Apple .
They are now very well known for making first personal computers .
Jobs still try to make his company better by taking ristks like trying totally different things like iPod .
In 21st century , new and creative is more affective than ` stick to what we had ' idea .

Successfulness does not only happen in technological field but also in fashion industry .
Coco Chanel is well-known designer from Europe .
One of the reason she became so famous is that she actually took risk and tried new style in women 's daily wears .
About 40-50 years ago , womens never thought about wearing pants or suits since it was more of men 's thing but Coco Chanel actually invented pants suit for women to wear .
It was a big sensation during that time for women to wear pants .
But women during that time felt that just by wearing pants made them feel less seperated from the society and less valued .
Chanel could have failed totally because the idea of women wearing pants could not have been accepted but she took the risk and actually made it happen .
If she did not tried new idea , I will be wearing big puffy dress now .

Taking risk and trying new things could hurt you if you do not succeed but succeeding will not happend when you try new things .
Coco Chanel in fashion industry , Steven Jobs in computer industry , Thomas Edison in light bulb industry , they all succeed and became famous because they tried new ideas and new things and also took risk of failing .
Without trying , there is no chance given to you to become successful .
