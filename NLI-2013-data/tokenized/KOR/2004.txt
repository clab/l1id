As the technology advances , many young people enjoy the benefits like computer game , TV and so on .
However , there has been negative factors such as broken unity between people , weapon using in young people such as killing person without thinking .
And also there has been negative factor by technology .
In my opinion , I can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First , technology advances cut the unity between people .
For example , the past generation does not have the machines such as TV or computers .
So , people must rely on each other and must be active .
According to scientific experiments , the active person are happier than the inactive person as young people .
However , nowaday , people do not rely on each other and do not move actively because they are always in the world of convenience , entertation with machines .
But , young people get stressed out because they find no purpose in life or get bored in life because they are just doing same things everyday !
Also nowaday , in many cases , technology is used in bad way which would harm people in nowaday generation .

Second , as mentioned in second paragraph , people need each other anyway in order to live .
But when society loses the unity of people , people would fight each other because they only think of their convenience .
As a consequence , the society and even individual would lose many things and could not be happy .

Third , from my neighbors , there are many old people .
I sometimes ask that past is happy .
And they said to me , `` Well , we do n't know how you will feel you life , but we are happy although we had to work hard at past compared to nowaday .
We all had hopes . ''
In addition , there are many news that young people kill themselves or kill other people .
It is because as mentioned in second paragraph , people trys not to adapt with society because in the home , there is everything you can entertain .
But because you have to live with society , people must corperate with society .
These could cause young people who are so deep in the technological machines to be stressed out .

I think that young people enjoy their life less than the older people because of following reasons : first , unity is broken in many ways and cause troubles and many consequences to young people to live on .
Second , because many of young people are deep in games or TV , they find their life boring and think life as without hope .
Third , technology that past generation never has sometimes is used in bad way and decreases happiness in life .
Because of three important reasons , I can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do even though life becomes convenient and advanced because of technologies .
