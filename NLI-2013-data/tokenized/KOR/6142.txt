I strongly believe that in twenty years , there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I will present an economic argument and current trends in automotive development to support my belief .

I think what the statement is alluding to is the fact that oil is becoming ever more scarce .
After all , we cannot run our cars without the right fuel .
Let 's consider this situation from an economic perspective .
The theory of supply and demand will show that with an increase in price of oil , the demand for cars will decrease , since the two are complimentary goods .
Intuitively , we know from our every day experiences that we tend to consume less of a good if the price goes up .
However , our dependency on cars is so great that despite rising prices , our demand will continue to increase .
For instance , imagine a world where you have no access to cars .
Traveling would become a nightmare .
Not only that , our economies will suffer from the slow movement of goods and the factors of produciton .
Due to such unforgiving circumstances , firms , consumers , politicians and dictators alike would choose to pay the higher price rather than suffer the economic consequences .
Considering the world 's present economic development , with the emerging economies of China and India , it is likely that the demand for cars would increase in the future , since more people will have the income to be able to purchase cars .

Secondly , there is no significant progress in developing suitable alternatives to cars .
Research in this area has been going on for a long time and remains to be active .
However , current proposals of harnessing the power of atomic fusion and hydrogen fuel are not likely to be accepted , due to the danger involved .
Instead , I think we are heading in the direction of trying to improve the efficiency of cars .
For example , we are developing hybrid cars , which run on a combination of electricity and oil , which are about twice more efficient than the conventional cars we drive today .

My current knowledge of economics and common sense dictate that the number of cars will actually increase in the next twenty years .
