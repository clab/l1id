Some people say that the youngsters do n't have any interests in helping their communities any more but grabbing their own ambitions , while others argue that the young of these days are more motivated to give help for their communities .
Considering the growing passions of young valenteers , however , I strongly desagree with the statement written above .

For the first , there are social advantages which encourage the youngsters to help their communities .
In specific , since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world , such as skills needed for processing certain job , taking part in local activities does n't mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more .
For instance , I once took part in local festival as an staff .
As there are so many foreigners who visited in my community , all I should do was rushing here and there , giving free interpretation .
Even though it was tough and did't provide me any money , I could more valuable things through that event , Improvement in my English interpretation , and social skills .

On top of that , the youngsters nowadays are tend to dedicate themselves for what they put their values on .
According to the Department of Labor of Korea , in 2005 , more than 60 % of colleage students have experiences of valenteering in their local needs .
What is more , they stated that what they wanted to acquire through their activities was not money but their self improvement .
This case clearly represent the fact that they are now put their values on not only material things but also the mental things .

There is an old Korean saying goes like this ; Helping neighbors is as valuable as helping one 's own siblings .
This represent the idea that giving one 's hand for others need is a kind of qualification to be an well rounded person .
Thus , as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one 's hand for their comunities exist , the active participation of youngsters will never be limited .
