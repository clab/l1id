Recently , I am questioning myself in what age will I be able to enjoy my life .
As a 23 year old university student , I came to the conclusion that older people enjoy life more than younger people .
Some people would think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do because they are young .
However , the real enjoyment of life cannot come in a young age .

First of all , young people do not have enough achievements and experience to enjoy life .
This may will sound strange to some people but in my opinion , to enjoy life , people have to have some kind of accomplishments .
I consider enjoyment as an in-depth pleasure that comes out of achivements a person has made and from occurances that a person has experienced .
Partying all nights would not be considered as the real enjoyment of life .
It can be a short time enjoyment but not in a long run .
For example , this winter I met some old couples who have retired from their work when I was in Cancun , which is a city in Mexico .
I could not forget the happy faces .
I had some chances to talk to them and what I was told that they just started to enjoy their life which seemed hard to understand to me .
What they were saying was that when they were young , they had so many things to worry , about the promotion in their work , their sons and daughters and so on .
But now they know how to enjoy their life without worrying about the thinks that was considered to be important in their past .

Secondly , young people do not have much composure in mind to enjoy life .
Young people who are mostly considered students have to work and study days and nights for their future .
They do not have enought time to look back and spend much time on their hobbies .
But as people get older , people tend to spend more time for their own .
There is somehting that my mother always says to me when I am slacking off .
`` To enjoy your life when you get older , you have to sacrifice your youth . ''

To conclude , even though it is hard to say that older people do enjoy life more than the younger people because there is not an exact boundary between old and young , I strongly believe that older people know how to enjoy their life because they have more achievements and experiences than the youngers have .
To enjoy my life when I get older , I am working hard to build up a bright future .
I hope that my belief that older people enjoy life more than younger comes true .
