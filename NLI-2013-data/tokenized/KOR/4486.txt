I agree with the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
There are three reasons for this .
First , the goal of a company is selling the product .

Second , advertisement make people buy their product in indivisual way .
A company which own the product 's goal is making their profit and that way , the company make people to think that the product is nessesary for them .

The company 's goal is selling their products as many as they can .
Therefore , poeple who are making a advertisement make better looking than real product and use it for the advertisement .
For example , .
in Taco Bell advertisement , half-pound beef and potato Burrito looks bigger than the burrito from Taco Bell in our town .

Advertisements make people think that the product is a neccesary item .
Few days ago , I saw a Old Navy commercial , They kind of made me think that if I do n't wear their jeans , I just do n't belong to our younger men community .
So , I bought the product but It looks as same as jeans I got two months ago .

Advertisement is for a company which is selling the product 's profit and it make most people to think that the product is what they need .
I was kind of addicted to television home shipping few years ago , the seller in the homeshopping mentioned about what kind of people need their product .
He said , younger or older ladies and gentlemen .
Instead of saying everybody .
that product was a pen with the light by the way .
This kind of mind contral makes people that product is nessesary even if they are not very important product .
