Which do you prefer the person who knows everything a little and the person who knows one thing deeply for your life ?
There will be no nessary to think of answering this .
Human society is so complicated that person who knows only one subject can not surive in competion .
Thus I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for getting better grades , having chance to adjust main subject and creating developed and combined subject .

Understanding many academic subjest help to get good marks for main subject .
Academic subject are have related each other .
That means every subject can help understang the others .
In my case , learning linear algebra in math department helped to understand in computer graphics in computer science which is my major subject .
Also creative writing class helps me to write good paper for each subject .
Like this manner , knowing many academic subject are good to get good mark .

Second , broad knowledge of many academic subjects give a chance to adjust main subject .
Choosing the main subject is important because it is related ones job .
So by knowing many academinc subject , student get to chance to adjust their subject .
They can find good od bed Last , it helps to create new developed area .
People created robotic by combing biology and computer technogy .
It does not happened with only knowing one subject .
In conclusion , broad knowlege of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
It helps to get a good grades , to having time to think if choosen subject is suit for indivisual and combined more decent area .
Someday , university student have to study more complicated and more subject for graduate since many subject will be combined and developed in relationship for more years .
