Whenever I plan for traveling , I consider whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel individually without a tour guide .
However , even though there are some people who prefer to travel individually , I like to journey following an instructor .
As I have experienced in both ways , I believe there are more advantages to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

First , traveling with a tour guide makes people be more comfortable .
For example , when I travel following a tour guide , I feel comfortable about not thinking of the direction of the new place .
The instructor had already planned where our group was supposed to visit , eat , and book the hotel , so there was nothing I worried about .

Second , it is safe to travel with a tour guide .
Because the tour guide knows where we go , there is less chance to be lost in the foreign country .
Also it is more comfortable to travel with a person who can communicate in the language of the country which I do not know .

Last , it is easier to get information of the place where we travel .
Since guiding is his or her work , the instructor knows information about where he or she take people .
Thus , people who travel within a tour guide easily get close to the new information as they listen to the instructor .
When I visited europe , I was fullfilled with the questions of the history of where I travel such as `` Winter Castle '' in Russia and Alps mountain in Switzerland .
Because I did not know how to speak English at that time , there was no way to ask to residents .
However , with the tour guide 's help and information , I could satisfy with what I wanted know easily .

With these reasons , I disagree with the statement , `` The bes wat to travel is is a group led by a tour guide . ''
It is more comfortable and safeto travel where I do not know much about it .
