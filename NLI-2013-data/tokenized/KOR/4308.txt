I agree with the statement because of several reasons .
It is very casaul and normal to not help their communities in this society .
As our society is getting more comlex and busy , we can not care evry sigle things .
It is very true that people do not give a enough tension to the communitis , but I do not think it is bad at all .

The following statement mentions that young people specially , why is that ?
Do you think old people give more time to helping communities ?
I do not think so .
As I said before , this is dog-eat-dog society .
Even children have no much time to play , they are very busy to learn everything they can .
Sometimes , each family members do not know about what their family do .

Also , from the statement , it says ' do not give enough time ' .
I am sure they are so many good people in this world and try to help the commuity out .
I know some people who really do that .
They do help them out because of not they have less busy time .
As we know , a lots of people help thier communities .
They have to satisfiy with that .

Me as a represant from all young people in the world .
We have so much big dream and big list of what we want to do .
Our brains move to think even we are in bed .
But the problem is the world is not give us enough time to do all .
so we have to select a one thing to do .
What i say is we are still trying to find that last selction .

To get enough attension from people , especially young people is too much .
It is not beacuse we do not want to help them , it is only beacuse we are deadly busy to do other thing .
