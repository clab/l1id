I disagree to this statement .
In my opinion the younger people should be the ones giving up their time up to the communities that are having a hard time .
Younger people are more in to things but not in partisapating in supporting people .
Why ?
I say because there is no benefit for themselves to collect .
I think we should sponcer to the help-outers like handing them out drinks and bread .
Also the reason might be because they do n't really know how much those help - needed people are suffering .
And for that I think it would be an awsome idea to set up an comercial for the people who do n't know the help needed peoples situation .

Or we can use the idea from my homeland , South Korea .
In my country students starting from middle school have to fill out hours contributing to others .
Middle school students from the first years to the second have to fill out the total of 60 hours .
They do this by going to school that have students whose life is hard from their birth or by cleaning out areas that we all own like parks , picking trash from street and etc .

I do n't think it 's a bad idea by letting the students know how it is wonderful contributing to our city this way .
Although these 60 hours effect you from going high school I got to know the wonderfulness of contributing toour comunitiy like this .
I am a middle school third year student right now and I assure you this is a great way to get young people stand up to this .
At first at my first year I was stuborned about this with my other classmates because it is hard work .
And I too , say at first I only ment to do this kind of stuff because it was required in my grades .
What made me change my mined was one of the experiences I had .
I signed up to go to one of the schools that have students ` not like us ' .

At first I was afraid of them .
That thought changed when I was cleaning the windows .
One of that school student came up to me saying hello in a weird way .
But as hours past by I learned that that student was interested in being friends with me .
I guess because they came up to me differnently I did n't really know at first .

Well , thats the case a me .
I am hopping to open a volunteers club when I grow up , so I 'm hopping these ideas would work in the future .
