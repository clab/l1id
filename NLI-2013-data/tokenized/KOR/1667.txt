I certainly thinks that having a broad range of knowloedge is better than knowing a only one subject deeply .
However what I mean is little bit different than what it sounds like .
For exmaple , If you are a leader of the orchestra , it is really important for you to know all the techniques that are used in leading a orchestra .
However it can be better if that person knows how to play piano or other instruments , so he can at least knows that feeling and share the pressure of people who are following his signs .
Therefore I conclude that knowing many academic subjects in one broad speicific subject would be the best .
These are the examples .

Misto Takile , one of the most respected orchestra leader in Japan .
legend creater of Yokimusa orchestra .
Question is why was he so great ?
He was a great leader , his techniques were concise and simple to follow , therefore it reduced the confusion of players who are following , but that did not made him legend .
He had something more than that ; his ability of playing piano and violin was good as a professionals , He could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middle of the practice .
He was also an expert in music history , He was able to , and actually give lecture about music history in Tokyo university .
By knowing how to play instruments , he has share the feelings with players , and give them better , simpler leads .
By knowing the music histroy , he understood better about the song .
He knew broadly about his profession .
That is what made him great .

Kim Mary , world famous zoologist who designed Nanjing Zoo .
She has been famous because of her excellent and effective designs of zoos .
However for her to reach this level , she had to finish 5 majors .
First she has majored in medicine , second animal medical care , third three-dimension design , fourth building construction and last but not least , zoology .
She has gone through all that to become the best in her area .
She knows so broad about what she is doing , she could become the best in her subject .

Therefore I conclude that knowing broad range about one subject is the best answer to the question .
If you take little bits of everything , it does not give you depth understading and it does not help you a lot , However if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subjects around your profession , it will give you lots of credit , it also might related to other big subjects as well .
You can possibly argue that Einstein was a math maniac who did not know anything else except math and physic .
But he was genius in a century , very exceptional case !
If you are not , and to be great in your area , I think it would be more beneficial for you to know broad range over your subject .
