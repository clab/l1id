There are several reasons for people to take a trip .
Depends on each person 's personality , some people prefer to take a trip alone while the others prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide .
This is controversial subject to dicuss about , however ; in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

The first reason is that , people do not need to worry about thier safety as they do when they travel alone .
Tour guide knows well about the areas that they are travelling .
As a result , they offer tourists who are in the group , a safe hotels to stay in and clean restaurants to eat .
In addition , guide gives several practical advices to help people stay out of problems .
For exmaple , in some areas , it is extremely dangerous to travel alone without any knowledge , such as New York where all kinds of crimes are happening .
Therefore , within a group led by a guide , tourists aviod some potential dangers .

The second , people get explanations of historical places that they visit .
If people are traveling alone , they need to purchase a guide book and struggle through it to find exact information that they want .
Or sometimes , if they cannot find , they may ask to other people who live in that area .
However , this is not likely going to happen because the tourists would feel embarrased from lack of knowledege .
As a result , travelling with guide is convenient .

The last , people save moeny and time .
As travelling with in a group , there is limited time to visit some places .
This means that they are going to visit important plaecs .
Plus , places that are worth to visit .
This help them to save time and preventing them from wondering which place to visit first .
Moreover , when people travel alone , they lose directions often , because they are new to that place .
They need to spend additional money for staying in hotel if they get lost and it is dark outside .

Consequently , Travelling in group led by a tour guide is more efficient choice for people , since they are less exposed to any sorts of crimes .
Additionally , people get abudant explanations from guide and save thier money and time .
