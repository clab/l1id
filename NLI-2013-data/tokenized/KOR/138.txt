I do n't think that yong people do not take care of their communities .
there are three reasons to support my oppinon .
When I was 16 years old I was in the school valunteer 's club in an year .
At that time , I could realize that there are a lot of people who help me without thinking of money .
Also I could understand why there are communities in the world .
I think there are so much chancese to take that kind of experience for young student in korea .

Listening radio is one of my hobby and my favorit program is ' Chin Han Chin Gu ' That means my best friend in english and most of listeners are middle or highschool students .
Whenever I listened that radio program , I could heard about a moved story about our life .
The MC of that program always tel the meaning of peace through the radio and that really helps me to do good things .
An year ago ' www.thehungersite.com ' is produced through that program and I 'm not sure but over hundred thousands students can heard about that same as me .
In that site , you can do a nice thing to hungerd children without money problem .

Even young peaple do n't help their society , that 's not only young people I think .
We live in a big city and there are not enough communication between our neigberhoods .
I think that 's the point why the people think they live in a cold-society .

In that reasons , I do n't agree with that young people do n't help their communities .
