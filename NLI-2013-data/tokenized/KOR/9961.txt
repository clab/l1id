I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
First people who try new things can have more chance to make a success .
I have seen the TV program showed how one of Korean business man got succeed and able to finally export electronical devices to US .
He used to be a engineer in a small electronical company .
His salary was good and economically stable .
However , in spite of negative opinoins from friends and families , he decided to leave company and make a new one because he had lots of idea and experiences for the electronical devices .
Initial period , he failed many times due to lack of experience in marketing and so on .
However he tried many other things like change the design of the product and collaborate people who knows marketing and business .
Now he is a CEO in the big company that earns $ milions per year .

People who is willing to take risks can have more chance to succeed .
My mom was poorly educated .
She always has passion and will in her mind for further education like going high school and college .
Though she has two kinds and families that she has to take care , she decided and started to search what she has to do for further education .
She took many lessons from the private institutes and took exams to obtain the graduate certificate for the middle school and high school .
Now she is trying to go for the college to study what she wanted to study like English literature .
She gave much more chances and opportunities to herself by trying new things like learning things from different places .
