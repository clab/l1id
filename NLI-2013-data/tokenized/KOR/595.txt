People , especially students , often discuss whether having some specific knowledge about one sucject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
However , I strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more useful .
This rational behind this that it allows people to have more chance to get a job .
Furthermore , students can learn well-balanced educations .

In Korea , most big companies want to recruit someone who has broad knowledge .
That is because these kinds of people are more helpful to them to make a large amount of money .
As everyone knows , as a matter of fact , having broad knowledge of many subjects has a disadvatage which leads to shallow knowledge .
However , this advantage can eclipse this disadvantage .

From my own experience , when i was a university student , i took a lot of academic courses such as biology , computer and spanish .
So , I got some advantage when I got into my company , SAM-SUNG .

On top of that , Students can get well-balanced educations .
Basically , the purpose of school is educating their students about many subjects .
That is because having specific knowledge about some courses is like picky .
I mean when children eat their meals , they usually pick up what they want such as meat .
So , it leads to health problem , obesity , which causes various health problem .
I bet that having specific knowledge is definetly harmful for their personality or their future .

Taking all of these into account , I have no doubt in my mind that having a lot of knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful for people in our future to reach our goals .
