There is staement such as `` fewer caes in wus in 20 years than there are today '' .
Logically , the number of cars have been growing .
But , some cuntries try to reduce the number of cars so that in 20 years there are possibility to have fewer cars than today .

For example , Korea , they have recommended to the pele that using the transports rather than their own cars .
Sinece 1900's , the number of cars have enomoursly increasing in Korea .
Because of that the envorinment have been damaged and more peoole have got a disease from the pollution whcih never happened before 1900 .

From article from Times , which i read , some country think about restiriction on the cars .
Thesd countries government would like to put the law to prevent to increase the cars in there countires .
they try to made that law to pass in congress because of high level of pollution and accidents .

On the other hand , the world become convincable to live , the peope who live developing country would like to buy a new car .
China is the one of the fastest deveolping country now .
They become much more richer than 30 years ago .
The most famous car company , audi , Hyun dai , and voswagen have alredy been bulit in China and produced their cars to sell the chian peole .
Also , the china government enouraged their citizens to buy new car and high technology goods .

Also , the become more competitive car market , according to market rule , the price will goes down , so many people can offered the new cars in cheap price .

The car company may deveople their car as good for environment .
Such as hydgogen gas car they have already invented for environment , In the future , they will invernt more good and unharmful car for both people and envrioment .

There are two cases uch as Korea case where want to reduce the car and China where has just started to develop their country .
The number of cars will not be reduced because of its convience , even if it is not good for environemt and making accidents .
If the scientist or car engineers invented car whcih is good for both environment and people , there will be no matter about the amount of cars at that time .
