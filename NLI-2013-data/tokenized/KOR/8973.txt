I dis agree that lt is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learning facts .
The learning is very important to students .
Fisrt , Through the learning , many studnets can understand other people and they can get acknowleages .
In Korea , many students bocome a mother because of baby .
They are very young and they do not have a job so they can not finish their studying .
Through the happen , the little mother can not care the babies as well because they did not finish their studying so the babies ignore their mother .

I think that we should sutdy for our babies because if we do not finish the education , we can not care our babies ae well .
Second , when we did not finish our education , we can not get a good job .
I want to become a curator but if l do not finish the studying I can not become a curator because I do not have a acknowleage about the drawing and artshistory .
Therefore , many students should study hard for our dreams .

Third , I think that if many students do not sutdy , many students will become a stuiped so it is affect to government cause the government can not gat a smart peoles , so their can not develop as well .

In conclusion , many students should study for their dr
