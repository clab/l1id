Yes , I agree with this idea .

Now a days , too many cars are running in the raod , in the city , every where .
I have read in the newspaper with the research , 70percent of the families has thiere own car , and many of them in a family has the average car of two .

The problem here is , the cars are polluting the air , and too many cars are leading us to traffics .
Many people are stressed with this problem also .
So the people here in korea recently started riding bus or subways going to work and home .
But still , many cars .

Not only the cars are polluting , but the soaps and trashes ..
etc .

When i walk around , I even can smell the bad gas on the air , and the part , it is getting worse .
So many scientist and people are searching and trying to reduce the pollutions .
And the fasted way to lessen is by riding bus or subways .

We surely have to do something about this , if we love our country .
Let 's say for example , like advertising alot , teaching our kinds , and leaving the car often at house parking lot , riding with neigh If we want to live in a beautiful country , ofcourse we have to take good care of our home place also .
So no matter what the reason is , we have to start as soon as possible .
By twenty years from now , I agree that there will be fewer cars .
Changing few habby 's will save our world .
