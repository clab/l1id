It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It has been controversail issue weather it is good for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Some people may insist that student specialize in one specific subject in terms of saving times .
As for me , however , I believe that it is desirable for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for the following two reasons : not only develop varies knowledge but also enhande sence of responsivility .

Firstly , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to develop many kind of knowledge .
If one student will study five subjects for one year he can study many things .
They make him to smart on varies section .

Additionally , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to enhande sence of responsivility .
Studing many academic subjects is very hard work .
But during a studing times he can learn sence of responsivility .
