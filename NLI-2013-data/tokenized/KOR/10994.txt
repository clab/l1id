The humanity has experienced numerous series of developments .
But if it were not for new equipments that allowed for efficient hunting of animals , farming that made stable livelihood possible , and the development of Internet that brought the world together , we would n't be living in the world so conveniently as now .
The same thing could generally be applied to humans themselves .
Thus , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than focusing on what they can do well .

Only doing what one already know how to do well leaves no space for any further advancement .
A story of mine would be an example .
I used to be very weak in mathematics despite the fact that I try to solve a lot of problems .
Without knowing the reasons , I went to a math academy where the teacher found the reason for me .
I was only solving the problem that I knew how to solve ; I was avoiding hard ones .
Thereafter , I try to solve whatever I confronted and became good at math .

It is also a historically proven fact .
If the Wright Brothers had n't tried to fly like a bird , or if they gave up in the progress because of the adversities and risks , the airplanes would n't have been invented .
If Samsung 's Lee Geun-hee had n't tried semiconduct some decades earlier than any other company 's leaders , Korea would n't have been able to credit Samsung for its assistance in the coutry 's developments .

Some might argue with a famous proverb , ` Jack of all trades and master of none ' , claiming that concentrating on what one knows best is advisable rather than trying everything .
Yet ` Failure is the mother of success ' rebuts that proverb .
Even when something is out of one 's specialty , it still is worth trying because that could possibly give the person new perspectives and understandings .

Although it seems risky and needs a lot of courage to take on new things , one must proceed in order to success ; it 's the common characteristic of successful people .
As is proven personally and historically , and by a well-accepted proverb , it could be said that trying new things and facing risks bring success .
