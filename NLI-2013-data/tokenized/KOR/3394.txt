These days , less and less young people are willing to give time to help their communities .
This is because students simply do not have enough time to spend other than studying .
Moreover , students tend to care less about others nowdays .

First , students spend so much time on their study that they do not have any spare time to help the others .
Many parents think that it is better for their kids to focus on their school work in order to enter a good unversity .
According to a survey , more than a seventy percent of highschool students had not enough time to do other things beside studying .
This proves the fact that even though some students want to participate in their volunteer work for their community , they will not be able to because of their limited time .
Therefore , young people do not spend their time volunteering because they do not have enough time .

Another reason is that the number of young people who care about other people are declining .
Their interest is only focused on their own success not on their communities .
Many experts say that a lot of mass media such as televisions and newspapers are responsible for this .
They show the importance of winning the race only .
They convince people that helping others is a waste of time .
Thus , more and more students are usually interested in gaining money or getting a good carrier .
Students are not interested helping others because they think it gives nothing in return .

The young , therefore , are not willing to help their neighbors .
This is because they scarcely have time to volunteer .
Moreover , even though they have time to help others , some students do not feel the nessesity of volunteer work because they do not think of others that much , these days .
However , the decreasing number of volunteers is very tragedic to the society .
We should make the young to care about others more to make this world better .
