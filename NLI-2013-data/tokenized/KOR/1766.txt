It is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subjects to success .
However , contrary to this opinion , I strongly believes that people who live modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects .
The reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who have a variety of knowlege .
Moreover , if someone focus only one specipic subject , he or she might be biased without balace .

First of all , I strongly believe that people who are living this period should have wide knowledge of many acadcemic subject .
The reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others .
When it comes to biotechnology , people are eazy to think that it has no relationshio with philosophy at all .
However , when I wached the some SF movie , ` Island ' , I deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives , so called gernorm project , is reasonable and ethnical .
It is a problem of philosopy .
This example shows that these two academic subjects are very imtimate each other .

Secondly , If someone commited only on only one specific subject , he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balancing .
This is because I believe that academic areas originated from one subject , which was not divided like now .
As society began to divided and specialized , the academic subjects began to separated too .
However , nowadays , there are new tries to combine the separated acacemic areas for more academic progress .
For ecxample , to cure patients , doctors are working with sociologist because the reason that patients suffer from disease come from not only health illorder , but also social problem such as too much stress and envirionmental pullution .

In sum , without any hesitation , I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects that to specialize in one sucject , All in all , academis in one .
