There is no doubt that car is the mainstream of transportation in modern times .
Although still cars are incredibly increasing nowadays , I believe that use of car will decrease in the future time .
I will present briefly two reasons to support my opinion .

First of all , polution problem it occurs is a serious issue in the past and also future time .
Goverments are making a strict schedule to control cars and pollutant it mades recent years .
Many experiments and results already showed that serious air pollution caused by car can cause lung cancer and lead human to death .
It is a problem that conflict with humans health even to humans survival , strong limitation of using car will made in the future time .
It is not a matter of only human matter of earth 's .

Furthermore , new transportation that is more convenient and do not make any pollutant will invent in the future time .
Already many scientists and experts of car started its ' invention .
Recently invented electronic and hydrogen transportation is a fine example of thisinvention .
They use electricity or water for their fuel to run which does n't make any pollutant to the air .
One problem is it 's price but development of technology will solve it naturally .

Invention of car was a revolutionary one to human kinds .
However it threaten humans lives recent time .
Limitation of it 's use and invention of new transportation is necessary .
I believe that humans will chose to stop using car naturally in the future time according to above mentioned reasons : it 's pollution problem and appear of new transportation .
