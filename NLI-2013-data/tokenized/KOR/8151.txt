It is a controversal issue that which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .
Some people say that students learn facts because it 's easy to memorize about something .
But in my opinion , students have to learn ideas and concepts about something because of two reasons .

First of all , learning ideas and concepts are a basic way to understand everything .
If they just memorise facts about something , for example , maybe at that time they think they know everything .
But after that if they met some problem that are simmiller with something that they just learned , they will not be able solve the proble because they just learned not basic ideas and concepts but the fact about something .
which means they do n't know how to solve the problem and how to think to find the way .

Second , if students learn ideas and concepts about something , it makes students can more creative than that they just learn facts .
For instance , if students learn about a car and understant ideas or concepts about how to move the car , after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bus .
Also , they will think about other transportation like a train or subway and think about their work .
Maybe these thinking ways make students more creatively .

In conclusion , because of reaons that I above mentioned , students have to understand ideas and concepts when they learn about something .
It is a best way to understand and also it helps students think about everyting creatively .
