Some people think yonger people enjoy life more than older people do , because they are healthier than older people .
I , however , think older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because of my personal experience .
I , therefore , disagree with the statement which says yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .

Older people have more knowledge than yonger people .
They have lived longer lives than yonger people and they have had more knowledge than them .
Therefore , older people will try new things that are good for them .
For example , young people spend their time to play or play games with their friends on weekend , however , older people climb the mountain with their business members or travel somewhere to rest .
This shows that older people do better activities than yonger people , which what make them to be healthier .

Therefore , I belive that older people enjoy life more than yonger people .
Older people have more money than yonger people .
This means older people have more alternatives to do .
For example , one day my father told a story about ski-diving .
At that time I did not know about ski-diving so my father brang me a place where is for ski-diving .
Many people were enjoying it and I really wanted to try .
I , however , did not have money at that time , therefore , I could not do that and I thought older people are lucky because they have money to do ski-diving .

Older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because they have more knowledge about life and money , which means they have more alternatives .
My personal experience taught me that older people can play more sports than yonger people and older people know more about what is good for them , I , therefore , disagree that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
