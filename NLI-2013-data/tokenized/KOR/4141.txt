some people think young people do not tink other people other are disagree that opinion .
however , in my opinion i think young people help others who realated them in community .
i also have three specific reasons .

the first , young person is more socialable than older person .
always give and take in social that exist various kinds of person .
somebody who no give ans just take can not live within communities .

sometimes young aged person looks like not spending enough time to help other communities becouse they act small in various groups .
totally spending time is same or more than olders the second , they help others at invisable parts .
older person help others phisically .
noways , technology is so devepoled so if i want help others on internet or phone .
i also help old person who live in different cities sending a letter for reduce their loneiness .

the third , young person think helping others is esseencial .
if someone ready their future themselves , they have to help others like or dis like .
almost callage or university even job area require time for voluntary work .
