I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In these days , many companies use advertisement to promote their products for aim of selling to customer .
Advertisement is a kind of persuasion .
To idealize their products , they make product focus on human beings ' feeling and ration .
So , they usually use the idealism , dramatic example , and demonstration , because those methods is well-acceptable to customers .
But , if you use unacceptable felling methods such as the pity , the poor or emptiness , the begging , it may cause terrible result .

For example , imagine that you can see acceptable approach of idealism , proper example , and perpect demonstration in ads and then you get good feeling about that and also you are fond of product .
Finally you will decide to purchase that in the end without long-term hesitation .
And company use big sport game like super-bowl game or major leage final .
You always have watched advertisement during the game , that is , break time .
you may concern that why company use breaktime to promote their goods by paying unimaginable money .
In contrast to your though , numerous people all over the world watch that big game for just two to three hours .
The company knows that it will influence tremendous effect to people who is willing to buy something .
At that time , people change their mind to buy ads ' goods instead of other product of different company .
It causes ptimistic result .
Finally company gives free-samples to people on a certain day to demonstrate goods of how excellent goods are .
Even in the mall or on the street becasue of crowed the herd .
In those examples are shown to us everywhere and evertime when we are in the situation of recognizing except sleeping .
