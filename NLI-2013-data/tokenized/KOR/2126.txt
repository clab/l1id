Young people often wonder about their future , questioning if they will be happier when they get old .
In general , older people lives happier life than the young .
First point that I want to address is that the older people are more stable emotionally As people become mature as a human being , they would not be tempered as quickly as they used to be .
we discover that it is meaningness to be agressive .
For example , I hated everyone at school when I was in middleschool .
However , when I read To kill a mocking bird , a novel , I started to realize that it is wrong to hate someone with no reason Second , older people lives happier life by managing or overcomming their hardships easily .
There are times of desperation and sadness in our lives .
To prevail frustration is very important to avoid depression and anger , but young people usally does not have ability to do so .
Statistics conducted on 2006 showed that there were average thirty students for a day who committed sucide because of their academic pressure .
It is relatively bigger average rate than of adults , while it is not ture that students bare more stress than adults .

The last thing I have discovered is that older people appreciates things in their life more .
My grandmother knows how to appreciate small thing in her life such as sunshine , food , and house ; it seems that she gets happy every moment in her life .

In contrast , young people tend to be careless and negative .
They say `` Cool '' only when there is a really nice things .

In Conclusion , Older people tend to have happier lifes .
By mangaging frustration , emotional stability , and appreciation of life able them to be happy in every aspects of lives .
