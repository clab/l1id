Ford , the genius who created the assembly line , in order to manufacture more cars in a smaller amount of time .
Since then , the production of cars have increased rapidly .
The cheaper and faster manufacturing of cars increased the production .
Supplying the comfort of cars to most of the the world 's population .
In my opinion , I think that there will be more cars than there are today .

Today 's scientists are testing to create a new model of cars in order the decrease the greenhouse effect .
There has been the invention of oil with the use of corn , however it has not been put ot effect yet due to the cost of cars which can function with that specific type of oil .
However , as the supply of oil will run low throughout the years , the demand for corn oil would rice guaranteeing the hygiene and the cleaness of the air in the environment .
Therefore , the people will not have to stress out about polluting the environment like today 's cars .

The population over the year has risen rapidly .
Over the next 20 years it is guaranteed that the population statistics chart will keep soaring higher and higher .
The increase of population indicates that more cars will be needed for transportation .
As I have stated in the previous paragraph of the hygiene of the corn oil , people would not have to worry about the greenhouse effect turing the Earth into a giant fire ball , or the glaciers melting and rising 100 meters above sea level .
Due to the increase of population the production of cars will keep increasing as well .

The increase in population soon will not be able to fit all the population in one metropolis .
As the cities become crowded the people will move out of the cities into suburbian areas .
Therefore , travelling will be necessary on a dailiy basis for most people who work in the center of the city , or have school in the cities .
Due to the transportation needed everyday , many people will consider to buy a car .
Therefore , the amount of cars in the streets will increase , along with the areas of the cities and the population in the world .

Cars will soon be a necessary object , which the population of the world will rely heavily on .
Therefore , the fluctuating of the amount of cars will not happen .
As long as Ford remains in our history books as the father of cars , the decreasing of Ford 's invention will not happen .
