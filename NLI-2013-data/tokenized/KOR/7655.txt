Even though a travel with a tour guide is more comfortable , safe , convenience , I disagree that it is the best way to travel .
There are several reasons to support my idea .

First , a group travel is not memorable and useful .
I experienced both types of trips .
When I accompanied with a male guide , he solved every problems and arranged all reservations .
Therfore , I could spend very peaceful time in Japan .
However , It did n't give any useful experiences to me , and I totally forgot all my trip quickly .
On the other hand , I went to China by myself .
I reserved my airline ticket and hotel .
Also , I tried to communicate with Chinese people with Chinese to find some famous places , to buy gifts and to eat traditional foods .
I met diverse people and learned a lot how to prepare for a trip .
Sometimes it was too tired to do anything .
However , it was so exiting and exotic .
Eventually , I still remember everything in China .
Therefore , I do not agree with this statement that a group trip is the best way .
Next , a group travel is fixed .
Whenever I encounter many new interesting places in other countries , I would like to change my schedule .
However , it is impossible in a group travel since a guide have to arrange all tourists .
In contrast , I can handle my plans accoding to my interest if I travel alone by myself .
I can go everywhere I want to .
In India , I met a kind woman .
She was interested in my country and me , so she wanted to invite me to her house .
I could accept easily her suggestion because I was alone .
I met her husband and her three children , and she prepared very wonderful dinner for me .
Moreover , I selpt in her house .
I experiences Indian traditional house , and saved my money .

For these reasons , I think a group travel with a guide is not the best way to travel .
Even though I may encounter dangerous or strange situation , I prefer traveling alone .
