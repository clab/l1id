I agree to the statemenyt that the in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The eveidnece , limited resource problem , new resnportation would support my idea .

To start with , we are having limited resource .
All cars are generated by traditional resource , such as fuel and gas , however these resource are scarced , which means there is limittation .
As the resource is limited and also depleate , the resource price will goes up gradually , and causes people unable to maintain their car or unwilling to buy a car .
Therefore there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years , becasue there is not aboundant of resource left to generate the car .

Lastly , the development of new transportation will contributes to idea that fewer cars in use in future compare to present .
The industry of create the new transportation is going on nowadays .
It is said that there would be time that each person has a plane of their own .
In twenty years it would be possible to see indiviuals have own plane , since there is a investigation going on .
As the technoldge developes , the new indiviual transportation made and would result the fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .

In the conclusion , I strongly agree the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are toay .
The ideas I illustrate would lead me to support the stament .
