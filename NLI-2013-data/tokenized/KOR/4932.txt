This time we are living at competition world .
Which means everyone has challenging each other .
Absoluly there is the winner or loser in the competitions .
But when that person heard some ` good job ' or somethings like good advertisements , that person get more power and more progress than that person 's own abillity .

Firstly , do not say bad things about that situation , when someone gor bad situation .
Because their already knows they did bad job , but if some person keep telling you did bad job , you mess up everything , the person who made a bad situation , get more sadly and not powerful enough to try again .
For example , old people says failure is mother of success .
which means if you made mistake , you will know that situation and how to get out of that situation , like answers .
Then next time when you gaet that same bad situation , you donot have to spend time foe thinking about get out of that bad situations .
So they can success next time .
So if make more advertisements to who fail something , that failer going to be make more good jor next time over their own abillities .

Secondly , advertisements , that is one of the way to looking good for the products .
For example , some products are very not useful and not help enough .
But if that products has advertisements , that products seem much betterthat they really are .
Because it is like feedback for people .
make a rumor , this products are really good , than people going to throuw away the bad think about that products from their mind .
And they will think like , this products are much better than they know before .

Thirdly , advertisements make products more trustly .
For example , this time of the century , people believing people 's talk .
Nevertheless some people doesnot .
But almost people believe and trust each other their own word and rumors .
So if people make rumors about the product so trustly , then the products going to seem much tustly than they really are .
So I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In conclusion , rumors , or in people 's conversations , it makes more trust or seem good to peoples for the products .
and I toally agree about most advertisements make products seem much better and truster than they really are .
they can seem their over abillities .
