Travel agency suggest their service travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
And mant people use this service for their safety and guide 's profesionality .
But one of unversity student , I disagree with a group travel along tour guide there are two reason why I prefer travel by my self : opportunity for learning other nation and saving my money .

Forst of all , traveling a group with tour guide remove my opportunity for learning other naton 's culture .
I had a chance to trip in Vietnam about two years ago .
there was guide for our group .
Most of our group did not concentrate guide 's explain and he did not care about it .
And I needed to keep our group so I do not have profer time to enjoy senary and food .
I went around at night with buying some beer and snack .
It is more exciting and memorable .
If I did not go out along and do noting the travel was just waste of a few days .

Second guide fee is expensive .
I do not have enogh money and there si many way to prepare travel plan , reservation for hotel and search for air plane scedule by using phone , travel book and internet .
when I was in savoy for visiting my cousin .
I traveled a lot of place in U.S.A .
I usually saw the travel guide book in the university library near my cousin ' house or searched the net .
so I did not spend unnesaccery cost such as guide fee .

In conclusion , I would like to travel without a your guide and along .
I want to prepare my travel schedule bv myself and save my money not spend guide fee .
traveling is one 's opportunity for broading their knowledges and expeirences .
Making their plans and behavioring more activites will help their exciting travel .
