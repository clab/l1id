People have different opinions on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Some people say that spacializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic .
However , I oppose the idea for two reason .
First , it allows students to have diverse job 's opportunities .
Second , it is beneficial to choose the major .

To begin with , it enables students to get various job 's opportunies .
It is known that when students in university have diverst information about other fields exept for their own major , they can get a good job easily .
Let me give my friend for an example .
One of the my best friends has built broad knowledge for a long time at an early age .
So , he got better jobs than me .
That is because he can have many options on jobs .
If he would not have broad knowledge of many academic , he could not get a job that he want to .

On top of that , it is beneficial to select the major .
Today 's many student in high school have a cercorn about their major in the university .
That is due to the fact that they should have chosen the university .
For example , my brother is in high school students .
He has a worry about his major that he do in the university .
So , his professor gives many advises for his major .
Fortunitly , he can dicide his major that is art .

In conclusion , I agrees that students have broad knowledge of many academic as I mentioned avof
