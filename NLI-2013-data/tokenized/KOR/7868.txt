I think the best way to travel is traveing alone .
However , if I do n't used to traveling places like language and culture , I need to go there with tour guide .
Consequently , if I trip to somewhere at first , it is the best way to take tour guide 's help .

When I was 6 years old , I travelde in Japan with my family .
At that time , I was so young trip to Japan alone and I could't speak Japan at all .
Abobe all , I could n't be knowing Japanese culture .
After all , I need my parent as a tour guide .
They live in Japan for 7 years and speak Japanese very well like Japanese .
At that time , if I know Japanese a little and their culture , I can enough travel in Japan alone .
If someone do n't know traveing palce 's culture and their languages , they will lose their way and sometimes they make mistakes like food habit .
In india , they ca n't eat cow 's meat for realigious belief and they do n't use sticks when they eat food , they use only their hand .

Of course , if we know traveling palces 's culture and language , we can travel alone .
There are some reasons to travel alone except tour guide .
At first , we can travel freeway .
If we travel some places with tour guide , they will always interuppt us until we traveld to finish .
Second , we can learn their culture and their language for myself .
If we have a few knowledges about thier culture and speak their language a little , we can grow up language skills and our knowledges about othter culture .
And then , we can explain our thinking to friends , family and relatives , so we will feel achivements .

I think it is the best way to trip traveling palces alone if we have enough knowledge about their culture and speak their language .
We can get many things form traveling in strange palces .
