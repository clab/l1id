I strongly disagree to the quote given .
I believe that enjoying life depends on the mindset and personality of each individual , not on their age .
I have confronted many teenagers who stress about their academic studies and social relationships with their friends and families .
I have had conversations with numerous teenagers who simply do not stop complaining about their lives .
How much homework they receive each night , how much nagging they have to bear from their parents , and what kinds of social drama are going on between their friends are only a small portion of the complaints that I hear from other teenagers such as myself .
On the other hand , I have encountered many old-aged adults who are entering into their latter portion of their lives but are enjoying their lives to the fullest .
They might not be financial well off or socially successful but they see things in a positive way and are thankful of everything they have .
I know an old man who has lost his wife several years ago , but , even after such a huge emotional obstacle , he still interacts extremely well with his children and people in his community .
There is no doubt that he misses his wife with all his heart , but he leaves his past to stay as his past and forms a better future with every moment that he is living out .

I think that when a person knows how to learn from the past and to look towards the future by living their best in the present , he/she is the person who knows how to enjoy life .
To be satisfied with the things that he/she has and utilizing them to make the most out of them are the ultimate way to be truly happy and successful in life .
I believe that age does not alter an individual 's ability to be happy , but it is the way he/she views life and what he/she makes out of it that help him/her find true joy in life .
