Have you ever thought about reducing car in the near future ?
some people say that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
What do you think ?

I agree to this statement and i will write few reasons .
First , there has been a lot of pollution around the world like air pollution .
so many people will try not to ride individual car but instead use bus or train .
These days many people do these kinds of things and I think more people will do the same thing .

Second , these days many people work in there houses .
The computer has developed so they can do what ever they want , like buying things , working , sending e-mails and playing .
So many people does n't really go out well .
Why would they go out ?

they have all the things they can do in their houses .
So car wo n't be needed .

Third , the world is trying to make a new car .
For example .
engineers are trying to make electric car .
Well it 's good and it wo n't pollute the air .
But let 's think about more .
It will be more expensive , complicated and more .

In my opinion we should just throw out cars and live a better life in the cleaner air .
some people say that they need cars to go to their parents when it 's thanksgiving or any kind of impotrtant day .
There are a lot of way to go there like in our country , we have KTX it 's really fast and more comfortable .
Why do you take cars even there are traffic jams and other uncomfortable things ?
Most people think of this way even me .

considering the facts that i mentioned above .
in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
well let 's see after twenty years .
I hope you enjoyed reading my essay .
Thank you .
