are not sleeping well these days .
They say that it is becoming a harsher world .
The development of technology resulted in isolation between families and neighboors .
The younger generation is especially thought of as self-centered and unhelpful to their communities .
Some facts might be true , but I disagree with the statement that the younger generation is unhelpful because young people spend a lot of time contributing to their communities by direct and indirect ways .

The first reason I disagree with the statement is that young people actually do spend a lot of time helping out with the community .
For example , in my college , every freshman 's dream is to join a student operated club to make school life more enjoying and plentiful .
There are various choices of clubs , ranging from drama clubs to tea drinking clubs .
However , out of the approximitly 100 clubs , one third of the clubs are volunteering clubs .
Also , our school has a course that gives credit for volunteering during the semester .
Eventhough the course is worth 1 credit , it is impossible to take the course because so many students apply for it .
It may seem like young people are only interested in themselves , but given these reasons , I unquestionably believe that young people spend a considerate amount of time helping the community .

Moreover , I disagree with the statement because the younger generation contribute to their communities not only directly , but in indirectly as well .
Unlike the older generation , the younger people are exposed to advanced technology and globalization .
In their own way their own way .
For example , my country , Korea , is a small country .
Recently , however , Korea has been expanding quickly into the world .
The reason is that young , smart people made succeses all over the world .
Because the represent our country , our country has a more succesful status in the world .

The younger generation may be a little more self-minded than the older people .
However , that does not mean that they do not help their society .
We are all contridbuting to our communities the way we can in our own unique ways .
That is why our world is still a beautiful place to live .
