I agree with the statement that people will tend to use cars less than nowadays in twenty years .
Firstly , more developed transportation than car will be made .
Moreover , people do n't need to move like nowadays since through the internet they will be able to handle their works without directly moving with their cars .

First of all , the new transportation will be made which is much more environmental friendly than cars in thesedays .
Nowadays , cars seriously cause the environmental problems .
Because of the gas released by car , it bring about the destroy of ozone layer .
Furthermore , the increasing use of fuel cuases the human to hardly find energy resources .
People living on the earth have problem which cars influence on our nature environment .
Thus more developed transportation will be made to preserve the nature .

Next , there would be little chacec for people to move with their vehicles to manage their works .
As the Internet grow , people can do their works conviniently .
They do n't have to move much to meet somenone or see the situation directly .
Intead , they can meet people on the internet even seeing each other by screen and have talk .
Also , they handle their work by getting the material by the Internet just on their desks .
This developing of Internet cause people no need to move somewhere anymore .
It can make the less uses of cars .

For these following reasons , cars are no more significant tools for future people .
First , more eco-friendly transportation will be made , moreover the less people use their cars becuase of huge developement of the Internet .
That 's why the use of cars would be decrease in 20 years .
