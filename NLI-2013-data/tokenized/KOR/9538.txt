After baby is born he/she growes up in many developmental stages .
If he/she adapted a new skills and knowledges in each stages he/she can develop the independency , self-esteem and maturity .
In the same reason I strongly believe that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

When people learn how to communicate with their close family members for their needs they start to build up their independency .
They are capable of being educated for the new things such as how to talk , how to use toilet or how to socialize with others .
They have to face everyday challenges and pick up the new skills and informations to grow up .
These experience give them independency to live their own in the future .

As children grow up successfully in ecah stage of life they develope self-esteem which need to continue to respond to changes .
When they have strong self-esteem they will deal with the difficult situations better and more efficiently then who have lack of self-esteem .

With all these successful experiences in growing chileren became an adult with maturity .
Successful people remaine having this maturity in their life and practice it in different times specially challenging time .

Doing something famillier make us feel safe and secuer .
But if people do not take risks to learn or creating something new there 's no development in human history .
