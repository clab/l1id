In modern world , we learned almost every subjects until university .
And many students who graduate university are complaining about this education system .
Because when they get a job , they do n't use many knowledge they learned in school .
I can understand their opinion .
In some part I agree with that .
However , it ca n't be a reason that we just have to learn one specific subject .
Learning variety of knowledge is very helpful for the people to be a specialist in some area .

If someone want to be a biologist , he needs to experience other subjects .
Mathematics , Literature , Athletic ..
etc ...
After he experience these areas he can be found his special gift in biology .
Unless he did n't experience these areas he could n't overcome his barrier that will face some day .
He can think that he may can do other work even though he is not sure about his gift in that area .

Especially in law , if you imagine about lack of knowledge about other subject , it can be uneffective .
Law is the subject to constitute the social system .
It is related with all parts of the world .
It affects the people 's life .
Judge 's narrow mind can be biased in one side .
And there will be a lot of chaos in public .

I think balance is the most important element for the well-organized society .
For the balance only one subject kowledge does n't work well
