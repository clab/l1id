Today , there are countless cars on this planet .
But are there suficient resources to maintain those cars ? .
I do n't think so .
Therefor i strongly disagree with the topic scentence .
First , let 's think about the resource problems .
Even now , the price of the gas is increasing by second .
In my oppinion , It shows how resources are limited and how much we have spent .
It is so simple that everyone can assume that , If there are limited resources and increasing demand for the fuel would make the reasource to be finish faster .
so after twenty years , there will be fewer cars .

Second , Our tecnology in advancing like flesh light of camera .
I can imagine how long will we use cars by , for example , I remember there was cummunicating system which can only accept the phone call .
But it was disapered after mobile phone was invented eventhough it was very popular in my country .
Therefor advancing tecnology would not let cars to remain after twenty years after .

The last reason that I suppots my idea might be the pollution problems .
Cars are creating pollutions like air , noise .
That refer to we need more advnced type of transports .

In conclusion , I claimed that after twenty years there will be fewer car .
In supporting passage , I said that scaresity of resources and rapid advancing tecnology and needs for advanced transpots reason for polluting environments .
