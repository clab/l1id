Some people agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , while others agree that it is more important for them to learn facts .
Although both views are valid to a certain extent , I personally prefer the former view for the following reasons .

First and foremost , a student can expand their knowledge by understanding ideas and concepts .
For example , when you are solving a math problem , you have to first understand ideas and concepts of the situation to apply the right formula for the question .
Memorizing the formula does not get you to solve the problem .
You first have to understand what question is asking for , and find the right formula to apply for .
By solving a problem , you can expand your knowledge of math .

Second , understanding ideas and concepts can allow students to have right veiws .
For example , the Holocaust is one of the events that should never be repeated .
By understanding what Nazism is and understanding the concepts of discrimination , students can have the right views of the event , and the same thing as the Holocaust can be prevented by them .

Fianlly , simply learning facts does not get students understanding skills .
Of course , it is important to learn facts , because some understandings are based on the facts .
However , learning facts does not get students understanding of the ideas or knowing the fundamental concepts .
In conclusion , I think it is much more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
