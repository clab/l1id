I do not agree to the idea that the cars will be decreasing in twenty years .
The reason is that the people keep seeking convenience .
The car is one of the most marble invention in the human history .
It makes fast the transportation and wide the working range of the people .
It is impossible to make slow the people 's commuttance and to make narrow the influence of individule in the future than today .
Then , we need alternatives to replace the cars .
However it is hard to expect that in twenty years .
Instead , I think the cars might be developed in many way .
For example , it can have convinent wings to solve the traffice jam or it can be driven by non-polluting fuels .
However , the cars will be more in use , even though the population is decreasing .

I live in Korea which has a small land but has three major supplier of the cars which called Hyundai , Deawoo , Samsung .
That means that the car is very useful and used widespread even in a small land .

I also have my personal car and my family has 4 cars with 6 menbers .
I would say it is common and getting more common in the world .
Another reason is that the car industry has much share of the whole industry .
It provides many jobs and is supported by much side industries and researches .
As I know the industry which has the most big percentage of inventions in the world is the car industry .
If the number of cars is decresing , the much of the economies of the world will be affected .

Therefore , I think it is hard to imagine the decrease of cars in twenty years .
