I agree with this opinion .
There are some reasons why I agree this opinion : advertisemenats can be everywhere and attaract the people .
First of all , we can see the any kinds of advertisements everywhere .
For example , most people read news paper everyday , and there are lots of advertisements on the news paper .
also , tv , on the street , buses and radio .
we can see and heard everytime and everywhere .

I t can give me fantastic image of the products and remember that product .
I think that it is kind of addiction .
The advertisements attact people with good picture or some comment .

In addition , the products cannot compete without advertisements .
Because , nowdays , the company think that advertisement is very important to attact customer .
So most companies use the advertisement to sale their products .
For instance , there are the most expensive price advertisrment in the world at near the time sqaure in new york city .
Most companies want to get that place for their advertisement even though price is so expensive .
It means that the advertisement has power to sale product and make products seem much better .

To sum up , advertisements are very important to sale products , attract the people , and make goods seem better .
Advertisement usually use the products ' advantage and fantastic image .
It can emphasize the products more than other products without advertisements .
