It is debatable whether students concentrate on ther major or learn about a variety of knowledges .
Some people say that students have to concentrate on their majors because it is better easy to find their jobs .
However , I strongly believe that students should have broad knowledge because the knoledge makes students well-rounded persons .
In addition , students meet many different people who help them have more tolerant respectivities .

First of all , taking various classes makes students well-rouded persons .
In order to success , they also need physical health .
Taking physical education help student stay in shape .
For example , my cousin who was suffer from obesity in order to be healthy , he took a dance class .
As result of it , he could lose his weigh through the class .
He could also more concentrated on studying , in the end he could get a sholarship .
I think that if he just had focused on his major , he had not had these positive effects .

In addtion , students can meet new people with different repectivities .
It is very important for them to live the rest of their life .
Also , in fact , the knowledge gives them more opportunities to find job .
For example , I taked a discussion class when I was a freshman in a college .
Then I could learn about other people 's opinions about the same topic .
Eventually , this experience helped me to find jobs .
According an article , many big corporations actually want the people who have various knowledges .
That ; s because they think the various abilities help them in many aspects of business field .

In conclusion , as students take various subjects , they can develop their abilities and find their talents .
Without any doubts , you should better experience in various fields .
