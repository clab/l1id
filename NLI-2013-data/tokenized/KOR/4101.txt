In the modern society , many things have change comparing to the past .
The Korean trdition for hleping other have dissapered but instead we developed a new way of helping our communities .
So I disagree with the opinion .
There are three reasons why I dissagree with the opinion .

First , the traditional way of helping others have changed into various types .
For example If you dial a certian number you can donate small amount of money or there was this event I went .
It 's the program to feel the starvation , uncomfortable house and all the pain that the children in the third world countries are giong through .
I donated some money and starve for 24hour .
By doing this I help a child to eat three month of nutritious meal .
so even though I did not visit a orphanage and did the cleanings and reading children stories I helped my community .

Second , the student have nowadays have to serve their community at least 20hours to go to high school or university .
Many people say that the true meaning of helping other is what comes out from your heart not the grades .
But because of this system I learn the joyful feeling of helping others .
After than I did more of the helping community more than the school required and I stared to get involved in many charity groups and jion unicef .

Third , Because of christianity , many students donate their money when they go to church and participate in activies to help the other in their community .
For example , my friend goes to church every weekend to give food for the homeless in park .
It is not only christianity that encourage helping others many kinds of realigion encourage students to serve the community .

Just because some traditions has chage it does n't mean that the young people do not give enough time to help the others .
So Because of these three reasons I disagree with the opinion .
