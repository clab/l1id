Nowadays , many people argue that the young spend not much time to aid other people .
Eventhough one of the policy to increase high school students to get the point for graduated , there are lots of the unhelping young because of indiviualism setted around the young and survival social curcumstance .

Above all , in my opinion I maintained that individualism is surrounded .
Once I prepared for the midterm at the college , one student did n't notice the information that the professor required all of the student should known .
Many student realized that the test strating before an hour .
Eventhough this situation could be so small to mention , I think helping my communities start from my closes friend then it spread out .
This kind of thinking mere myself increase bad effect to others .

Moerover , the one of the reason that young people is not helpful belongs from the social circustance .
The social make the young more hard to get their jobs .
They want more capability of sense , knowledge , and level .
These make students themeselves more competetive .
Consequently , they have to improve their career by make a lot of particular experience , not like voluntering for the old or helping the handicaped in the public volunterring service center .
The research of declining amount of helper suggested usually at the newpaper thesedays .

To sum up , I proposed that the younger are not caring for their neighbor reccently .
This is because of change of personal behavior such like indiviualism and atmospher that the government express .
