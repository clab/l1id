There are many jobs , places to go and ways to enjoy things .
As the world becoming more and more complicated and the society growing .
And the mentalistic things should also be growing , too .
Now a days , I see few young people helping their communities .
So I agree to the subject because of 2 reasons .

First , I see only few young people helping their communities .
When media interviews the poor or the old , they say that they want to be loved and cared , It 's the young people 's job to do this .
They just care for themselves and not others .
The young people should know that helping the society is helping themselves

Secondly , the young people only think of themselves .
Their are many ways to help the community , but they are avoiding these .
They say that they are busy working , but are n't other people busy ?
Now a days , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves .

Because of these reasons , I think young people are not donating their time to help their own communities .
They should make a time to volunteer and let the society be helped by themselves .
