We call older people for people who are arriving to the end of their life .
In fact , this would not make them happy because this means the remaining time and memory they 've got is short .
However , it makes them to figure out how the time and every events are so precious and valuable to them .
Therefore , they would try to enjoy thier life more than young people .
And they will do it .

These days , in asian regions , many high school students commit suicide , particually in Korea and Japan .
Usually , most of them get accumulated stress from school work , their grade and accepting to university although graduating and going to famous and prestigious university is not the full of life .
As a student who used to study in Korea , Korean studetns do not have much free time to enjoy in high school life , because they 're forced to study from teacher and family .
I was also one of them .
Their life is repeteation of studying and learning .
The only reason they work and study so hard is in order to go to university .
In other words , there is no hope and happiness to live life to them .
I believe there might be some exceptions but most of them are just like that .
Furthermore , young people ( teenagers ) desire to be an adault as soon as possible because there are a lot of exhibitions that they cannot do such as smoking and marraiage .
They just spend their time without doing anything .
On the other hand , most older people realize the importance of time , and they try to make good meomory and spend great time with their family .
The reason is basically because they do n't have enough time to enjoy their life .
For example , if somebody informs to you that you have only one week to live and you die .
Then , you will try to do your best in everyseconds and would try to enjoy your remaing time .

In fact , young people do not realize the importance of time every events and memory , because they are young .
It also includes me .
However , our reaction and action to live our own life would be changed once we figure out how the time is invaluable to you .
