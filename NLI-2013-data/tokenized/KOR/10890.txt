Some people might say that try new things and take risks to suceed .
But i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreay know how to do well .
Because those who are working like professional , they have confidece and dream when they work .

First of all , they are not always successful either they try new things or not .
I think the most important thing is confidence for success and without knowledges , it is hard to try new things and take risks .
For example , one of my friend studied economic but now he wants to transfer to art school .
Does not it make sense ?
he had not been drewing about 20 years , so that he gave up .
Like i said , when we try something new things , even we should have basic technic or knowledge .

In addition , we have to have dreams for our successful life .
There are so many people who try to new things without dream .
In my opinion , If we just work without dream , we need more time to suceed than peolple who have dream .
For instance , In korea , people try to suceed everyday .
But it is extremely hard to suceed , even they have skills .
Thus many koreans surrender their job then they have their own business and they are more successful in life than people who go to company everyday .

In conclusion , we all want to suceed .
But in order to suceed , we have to have confidence and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do very well .
If we always try new things without know-how , we always might be behind .
