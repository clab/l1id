There are lots of cars today anywhere on earth , and it is clear that the number of using cars has been steadily increased by the development of techniques in making cars .
Although more and more cars are still made for many people who want to buy it , I think the popularity of the car may be decreased in twenty years for the following reasons .

First of all , there are too many risks to drive a car in real life .
Even though the modern cars are well-equipped to reduce the risks broken out during the accidents , it can only minimize the risk of the accidents , not prevent it from original occuring .
In reality , the more cars are bought , the more accidents are occured by it .
Furthermore , the risks of driving a car is much severe than we expect .
If we are injured by the car accident , it might cost not only a lot of money for us to cure our body but also lots of time for us to overcome the mental fear from the accident .
So , for this reason , I think many people will not use the car as much as it is used now for their safety .

Moreover , there are lots of other convenience transportation around us , especially the subway which can substitute the role of the car perfectly .
These day , we use subway very often when we go to somewhere we want .
Different from the beginning of the history of the subway , we are now easily accessible to the subway station near to our homes , schools , and workplace ; therefore , we can go anywhere we want also by using the subway , not by the car .
And the strong point of the subway is that it helps us save our time .
There are so many cars on the road that it not only makes us be tired of the traffic jam but also makes it difficult for us to arrive at the place in the time we want .
That is , using car can be the waste of our own time .
Thus , I think the subway will be used much more than the car in the near future .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement that the number of people who use the car will be decreased in twenty years , for the reasons I mentioned above : severe risks that the car can bring and the appearance of the more convenience transportation such as the subway .
