I agree this statement ; sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Thhe successful people did this statment .
I think they wanted to live more comfortable than before , so they are always difiant to every situation .
Most of peple do not try new things and take risks becuase they live contently thier own modern lives .
I suggest two successful people who try new things and take risks that they wanted to develop human 's life .

First , Right brothers who developed the planes as modern one .
They already knew how to do well .
But they took risks when they got experiment to fly the planes .
They got obstacles to make or develop the planes because sometimes , the planes had fallen down on the ground .
They gave their lives for developing more effiently the planes than previous planes .
Finally , they rewrot the history of planes .
They were basical the inventors of modern planes .

Secondly , Billgate who developed the computer program and something like that .
Billgate was genious guy when he attended the university , which is Havard now .
He wanted to make or develop the computer program because in that time , the computer program was so slowly and often did not opterate while the people use the computer .
He got risks when he attended the university because sometimes , he got suspended from the university that he did not study at all .
However , he developed computer programs that one of important program is Windows now .
He knew he did not make and computer program because people did not concern about the computer .
However , Billgate developed people 's lives more comfortable than previos circumstance .

Most of people do not try new things and take risks becuase they do not want to be in dangerous situantion or circumstanse .
But if you want to be successful person , you try to make new things and take risks .
Probably , you got failed much of times .
However , do not be afraid that situation which can make that you will be successful person .
The one proverb said the failing is mother of success .
