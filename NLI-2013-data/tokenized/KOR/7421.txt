Nowadays many people go to travel .
Most of time they firstly should chose place where they want to go , then will think of whom they want to go with .
In a group or individual way ?
There are some benefits to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
However , there are many reason why I believe that the best way to travel is an individual trip .
It is more enjoyable and economical .

The threshold reason I like individual way to trip is that I can enjoy my time with myself .
Travel is the best way to find one 's self .
If I want to think deeply , I need to be alone , but unfortunately , in a group , that 's almost impossible to happen .
I have to consider what other people want to do since I 'm in a group led by a guide .
Sometimes I have to do and go what and where which I do n't want to .
More over , I like to sit and read while I 'm in foreign places , and this is also difficult to happen if I 'm in a group .

The second reason is that I do not spend more money than what I planed .
Sometimes the tour guide leads people some store where they are connected by little commition .
In this case most of time people or I tend to buy something by accidentially .
This is the one of many benefits why I like individual trip rethar than group tour with guide .

I know there are also some benefits to travel with group and guide .
I do not lose on the street in foreign place , do not need to worry about hotel and schedul .
But , then , there are no way and nothing to learn from my travel .
Trip is an adventure in our life .
Since I believe that is the best way to find myself , I would like to go my trip alone rether than with a group led by a guide .
