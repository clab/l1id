Today , scientific technology is developing continuously .
The field of scince is helping our lives a lot in many ways .
One example is transportaion .
People should spend a lot more time to move from one place to another place when they did n't have transportation but it became possible as they have many different ways of transportation .
For example , subway , trains , airplane , bike , cars and so on .
They brought us a lot of advantages .
However , the transportations have also disadvantages .
In my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are toay because cars cause pollution and are dangerous .

First , cars bring pollution to us as producing a lot of exhaust gas .
To move cars , we have to use gasoline gas or LPG gas now .
However , those gases are extremly harmful to our societies .
They affect us to end up the various disease and increasing of carbon dioxide in the air .
As we breath , we are taking dirty particles from the air .
Also , increasing carbon dioxide is serious problem now in the world .
It could lead to bigger problem such as global warming which also cause many different events including melting ice mountains so that the level of the ocean is getting higer .
Using more cars mean that we are going to bring more environmental problems to the world .

Second , cars are dangerous as I said before .
There are so many accidents occuring everyday by cars .
We can reduce those accidents by practicing not to use cars .
Instead of using cars , we could use other transportation which cause less accidents .
Also , the issue of traffic jam affected by car accidents in the middle of the highway could be the problem .
As they solve the problem of accident , more people could have damage from it .
Cars could bring us dangerous accidents including death .

In conclusion , development of scientific technology would help to create better transportation than cars so that people could use it without causing pollution and accidents .
Therefore , in twenty years there wilil be fewer cars in use than there are today .
