Whenever I think of successful men , these two persons always hang around my mind , Thomas Eddison and Christopher Columbus .

Even though they lived in quite different era , they always get me thining about the issue that what makes them such a successful and great persons thoughout the world and in the history ?

Evidently , I believe that trying new things and taking risks are the main factors of that .
