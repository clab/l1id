Many people , mostly from older generations , fecklessly asserts that young people lack the virtue of self sacrifice and the will to make better community .
However , I would like to point out that we can not even prove that time consumation of young generation has declined nowadays if we look at the situation in several perspective .
Therefore , I do not agree nor disagree on the statement .

Firstly , there is a difficulty on actually measuring the time spent among young people for helping the communities .
We could gather some sampled data from public organizations on participation of young people .
However , the statistic could ignore some hidden contributions from them .
Maybe the younger generation got wiser and follow the virtue of humility which will make them to hide what they have done form making better societies .

Even if we disregard the unseen contributions , and prove that the time consumation is declining , we should look at the environment the younger generations are facing today .
The older generations did not have the notion of `` unlimited competition '' which the youngers are faced with .
The young people could be splitting their precious and important times to community contributions while older people , when they were young , had much more free time to contribute .

From these points , I would carefully disfute that the younger people are not contributing much of their time to the community .
