I do n't agree with the following statement : `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
I believe that they are in fact investing more time into supporting their communities that their predecessors did .

To raise a few specific reasons regarding this point , they are as follows :

First , thanks to political maturity and stability in Korea , most of the Korean students are not involved in the wild student movements any more .
They purely think about their academic affairs and building whole character through helping those who are in needs .
For example , it is often noted that many young stuedents visit the homeless people in the vicinity of their schools and provide food and some medicines .

Second , the higher educational institutions like universities and colleges restarted the education of theory and the practice of ethical education .
These school authorities specifically have developed and initiatied multiple ` Community Support Programs ' , and are encouraging their studednts to actively participate in them .

Third , the strength of the students ' community support activities are in that the students can enjoy sufficient time to help the communities during their regualr vacations in summer and winter .
Moreover , many of thier parents and their school authorities are not sparig any financial assistance for the people .

Fourth , from a systematic approach , it is very clear that almost all lower and higher educational institutions throughout the country are focusing on graduating students of whole character .
It is known that the students are , to some extend , required to plan and carry out their respective community support activities during the summer and winter vacations .
Also , as a matter of course , the school authorities give credits to them .

In conclusion , young people 's proactive participation into the community support activities is very much desirable societal phenomena .
Their spirit and enthusiasm have to be further nourished and encouraged by every segment of the society .
