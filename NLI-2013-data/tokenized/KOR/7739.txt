Some people say that the group tour is the best way for safe and convinient tour .
However , I diss agree this idea for two reasons .
First , we do n't have free .
Second , group tour need more extra money .

To begin with , how many people like to be controled ?
Of course , it will be very few people .
However , when people travel with a tour guide they should be controled .
People will have less time for their own free time because they are group so they have to follow the rule .

It will be very annoing .
Let me take my experience for example .
Two years ago , I went to the Tiland .
At that time , I could not set my own sckejule because I did n't have much time before depart the tour .
When I arrived air port , I was very angered because a tour guide guided more than 50 people .
So she could n't care abot each individuals .
Also we have to conduct as sckedule which made by the guide .
So , it was really bad experience .

Next , if we travel by onself , we can save money .
Many people expect that a group tour will be cheaper than nomal people 's tour .
However , the group tour usually need the mandatory shoping so it is definitaly not cheap even expensive .
A few days ago , a TV program covered about the exaggerated group tour .
These tours dcampained their item is the most cheapest .
Many people enrolled but when they arrive the place .
They have to buy and buy and buy .
If you tour alone , this will never arrise .
You can spend your money economicaly .
In this sense , group tour is not good idear

In conclusion , I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group tour for the reasons that I mentioned above .
