Many people try to keep current situation .
After getting job or getting marriage , they do n't usually want any changes more .
However , when we see the successful people from in the past to now , they never stop challeging something new and even do n't afraid of risks .
I strongly agree that successful people continually challege new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

To start with , successful people enjoy new challeges and feel happiness overcoming finding new one of new solution .
One of my friends , Jenny , has much curiosity around her .
She always think over how to be more comfortable than now even a small one such as hanger and fan .
Last year she got a prize for her invention in her country and got a schorlarship for university and going abroad to the U.S.A .
In addition , she never feel disappointed with fail , and she think again and again and redo .

Likewise , succesful people feel happy new thing and finding new solution .

Furthermore , successful people never satisfy with current stability .
Usually , many people are afraid of changeable situation and persue the situation that is stable and they already know .
However , my science teacher does n't want stability .
She does n't be scared of change and even take risk .
She became principle of most famous science school in Korea .

In conclusion , successful people enjoy new challege and do n't afaid of risk .
Even though they face with fail situation , they overcome the problem and try to find better solution .
This make the world more comfortable and happy .
