There are two types of people whether use of car decrease or not .
Some people maintain that using car will reduce because vaious technology will develop .
Other poeple belive that using car will be retained .
I agree with this view because car technology will be improved and because it is very short to replace with another transportation system .

First of all , during twenty years , this tine brings enhanced car technology .
Now , car is evolving quickly to give us conveinice .
after twenty years , poeple make car smater than now .
Through this , since human feel more convenient gradually , use of car will not reduce .
A recent survey show that people want to buy smart car and they wat to travel this car .
Also smart car of TOYOTA enable us to find road and to utilize various functions .
Moreover , by improving car technology , price will fall to reasonable price because car company expand their amount of porductions .
Therefore , using the car would not decrease .

Moreover , the twenty years is very short to appear anoter trasportation system .
it takes a lot of time to show new technology .
Futhermore , although new technology appear , it is hard for poeple to use immidiately .
Some professor sya that maybe twenty years
