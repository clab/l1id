I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
Rather , young people today are a dynamic force bringing change to the communities and nations they live in , especially here in South Korea .
First , young people involved in the community have transformed politics , most notably in the 2003 presidential election .
Second , youth are playing a major role in Jeju Island , helping to get the island recognized as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site .
Third , young Koreans are helping the nation in it 's geographical naming dispute with Japan .
For these reasons , it 's not accurate to say that the young generation is n't involved in the community .

Young people have brought the winds of change to politics in South Korea .
In the 2003 presidential election , conservative Lee Hoi-Chang was poised to win the election , leading in all the newspaper polls .
Young people , whose voter turnout had traditionally been quite weak , supported the progressive candidate Roh Moo-Hyun while the older generation supported Lee .
The old generation also had higher voter participation , so Lee was considered a shoe-in by many .
However , 2 weeks before election day , mostly 20 - and 30-something campaign activists for Roh Moo-hyun campaigned for free in many local communities throughout the country .
The decisive factor was the young generations ' use of the internet to bring far-flung communities together online .
The result was a come-from-behind victory for Pres .
Roh Moo Hyun .
This never would have been possible without the work of youth politically involved in the community .

Second , youth in Jeju Island , South Korea are the vanguard of the environmental movement there .
In 2002 , Jeju Island was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve because of the uniqueness of Halla Mountain , the highest peak in South Korea .
This designation came about due to a signature campaign conducted by the Jeju Federation for the Environment , a quasi-student organization run by youth .
Also , the same young people are pushing to have Jeju Island recognized as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2007 .
These youth are having a huge effect on Jeju Island , helping it to become more internationally-known .

Finally , youth in Korea are helping a large community , the nation of Korea , in its dispute with Japan over the naming of the East Sea/Sea of Japan .
Up until the mid - to late-1990 's , no one in the world ever questioned the naming of the sea to the East of Korea , also known as the Sea of Japan .
Japan unilaterally named the ocean between Korea and Japan during its colonial occupation of Korea in the early 20th century .
However , thanks to the efforts of students and youth , this name began to be challenged .
Students participated in an internet campaign to lobby officials of international geographical naming societies to reconsider the name ` Sea of Japan . '
Because of the overwhelming response from Koreans , mostly the young , the international geographical naming body changed the name from Sea of Japan to East Sea/Sea of Japan on nautical navigation charts .
This would never have been possible were it not for the efforts of Korean youth in the international and national community .

There are some who underestimate the participation of youth in their communities , but the reality is that youth are having a major impact on their communities through political , environmental , and international activities .
Youth are important members as well as future inheritors of their communities .
