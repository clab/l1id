In my country , the parents usually say to their children that you do n't have to do new things for success , risking your life , but just do what you have done well so far .
For me , however , successful people seem more creative and adventurous rather than conservative and tending to be safe .

The world is relentlessly changing .
Without any changes of one 's self , one cannot come up with the change of the world , even if one already has become successful .
Consequently , one will keep staying the past , and not be able to make an achievement meaningful for the present .

In addition , if people only keep doing what they know how to do well , someone else will try to do what other people know how to do well , and he or she finally will become another master of it .
After all , there will be no difference among them , and therefore be no new succeed for previous successful people .

Accordingly , in order that not only normal people become successful people but also already successful people keep up with their past succeed , they should make a new try .
Needless to say , already successful people have done like that , will do so for their future succeed .
But , I do n't mean that the what people has done before is not important so far .
It can be great basis for new things .
So , it is also essential to respect what we have already done .
