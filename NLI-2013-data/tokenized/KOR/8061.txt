I agree that It is impotant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the concepts and ideas are basic foundation and root ..
How can trees are survival without their root ?

one example , Many Korean students are good at Math .
some students practiced simple math questions repeatly without understandingof concepts .
they reapeat and repeated on the same or simillar questions .
they can get a good grades in elementary school .
but in geometryl , students who did n't figure out of math ideas ca n't prove the solutions how it works .

another example , I studied hard on Math when I was in school .
After 20 years later , the numbers which I studied have been just numbers .
I have I do n't remerber .
any thing .
