I agree with that fact the most advertisements products seem much better than they really are .
It has to be that way , would you want to buy anything that does n't look good or seems not useful ?
Like it says , it 's `` advertising '' .

For example , the M'c Donald 's Big Mac seems really big , yummy , and tasty but the real Big Mac is n't really that big as showing as an advertising .
They just put more stuff to make it look bigger and use frash ingrediants for the advertising .
If it does n't seem like that big and tasty , people wo n't want to eat .
It 's all about the advertising that people want to eat and buy things .

And also , I think the better advertising satisfy people 's mind .
For example , on the car advertising , who does n't want to buy nice Mercedes or BMW ?
but all the poeple ca n't afford them .
When you look at the Honda Civic 's advertising , it looks fancy as Mercedes , too .
You know it 's not that fancy or nice as them but you just look at the advertising and satisfy yourself .

The advertising uses certain places , models , concepts , lightings , and ect , to make the product look better .
On the clothing advertising , someone who extreamly georgous model wearing silk coctail dress , you would want to buy it .
That 's what models are for .

In conclusion , the adversitings are not lying but it just has to be look good .
That 's what advertisings are for .
