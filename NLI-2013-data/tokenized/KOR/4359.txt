It may looks like it to many people , but I disagee with this .
I think in old days , things that should be done had been visible .
It was need to be done with physicall labor .
Now , physical labor is less needed by using machines and computers .
Young people nowadays just do n't have idea what is really needed .

Where their hearts are , where their treasure is .

Old days , Society was composed by big families .
Everybody is helping everybody .
You know who you are helping , because they are their family members , relatives , or everyday neighbors who is even more close to your real relatives .

But in modren socity with nuclear families people do n't know really about their neighbors .
In this situation , getting help from other people sometimes considered as personal shame for some of us .
As society is more and more materialized .
We tend to judge other people by what they have , rather than what he/she really is .

We should teach our young people about real values .
We should open our eyes on emotional and spritual world .
So that their values are not to have something more for them selves , but for others .

Let ' them have chance .
