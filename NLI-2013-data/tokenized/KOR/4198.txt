I believe that young people these days do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In next few paragraphs , I 'll provide reasons behind my belief .

Firstly , young people today are raised in a small family , an average size of 3 or 4 .
The figure indicates that young people would have one brother or sister at most .
People raised in such environment will take less consideration of others .
In other words , they will turn out to be selfish and self-centred .
They do not know how to help or when to help others , not to mention their communities .
20 years ago , when the average size of a family were anywhere from 4 to 8 , people did not have the perception of young people not helping heir communities .
Young people back then were so used to live in a large group .
They were naturally raised in a manner that they would appreciate their surrounding .

Secondly , young people nowadays are so tide up with their normal duties that they do not have to spare any time for anything else .
They are living in a very competitive environment .
They are constantly pushed to excel in academics , sport , and etc .
Whatever activities they are engaged in , they are under constant pressure to perform .
Natually , in order for them to compete with others , they invest lots of time and resource .
I know a 8th grader who finishes school at 3 PM .
After she comes home and had a bite , she goes to see a private math teacher .
After math , she goes to see an English teacher .
By the time she 's all finished meeting her private teachers , it 's already 11:30 PM .
She comes back home at 12:00 AM , washes up and goes to sleep .
She does this everyday .
Kids like her just do not have any spare time for anything else .
Even if they do , they wo n't be able to allocate enough time .

Due to above two factors mentioned , young people nowadays cannot give enough time to helping their communities .
