I agree with the statement that successful people take risks rather than doing only what they know .
Successful people do take risks as they want to escape from the ordinary life .
I do not call myself a very successful person , but I once have taken a risk and my life had been better .

First , some milionaires famous in one area , once was a expert in other things , and I think that happens because that those people know how to master on one kind of subject .
Henry Ford , the father of car , once was a expert on a watch repair .
He worked as one to earn his room rent and to study mechanics .
Then he thought about transportations and invented cars .

Next , the successness is equal to the riskyness .
Which means that when you have a high probability of failure , then you have a high reward when you success .
I am in middle school grade three , since grade two , I liked a girl .
She is in same school and I still like her .
I wanted to say that I like her , but I got to shy when I stand in front of her .
When I said that , I felt like falling down a endless cliff that I could never come up again , but when she laughed , said nothing and looked at me , I felt like a mattress holding me from the cliff , so I like her , and she knows that I like her .

Lastly , risks are sometimes making something new or re-designing some products .
Edison , the king of invention , once tried to hatch an egg , and did not to go to school when in elementary school .
His mother taught him .
When he were grown up , he made a telephone which was already made by Alexander Graham Bell .
However , the Edison 's phone was better to hear , so people bought Edison 's phone .

In conclusion , successful people try new things and take risks rater than just doing what they know and what they can do well .
