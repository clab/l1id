The advertisement is first made to introduce the product to the customers , as the mess media keep developing and became popular source of advertising the advertisement skill is also developing .
There are three ingredients of advertisement that is essential to convince the customers the products seems better than what the product really is .

First one is the visual impact of the product .
This usually can be seen in homeshopping programmes in television , such as food .
All the products that are introduced in the programmes seems tasty and good , the products that are shown in the progammes are well-made .
However , this might not be true sometimes when one actually got the product , the customers might be dissapointed to see different , or less-well-made , product as one never thought it to be .

Secondly , the sound impact of the advertisement can also convince the customer to misconception of the product .
Many scients indicated the power of sound can change the mood of a person .
Sometimes the advertisers use popular songs , raps , or even classical music on their TV advertisement in order to make the customer 's mind into calmness , excitement or eagerness .
The customers , when they sees the CFs , might like the product just because he/she are unconsciously fallen into the background music .

Lastly , the impact of the famous person .
For those who only cares about what the product is , not who the product introduce the product , this might seems awkward .
However , people who are casted by the CF managers earn millions of dollars , this indicates the power of the celebertises in the advertisement market .
Most commonly , in movies if a famous actor/actress or even some famous basketball player is casted , that movie seems to be successful just by advertising whether the movie is well-made or not .
To summarize my opinion , I firmly believe that the advertisements are convincing the customers into a misconception of the product , by making the product seems better than what they really are .
The overusing of this three ingredients of advertisement are now becoming the one of the biggest problem that United States and all the world 's media has .
