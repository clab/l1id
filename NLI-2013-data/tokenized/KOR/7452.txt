I do n't agree that the best way to tavel is in a group , specially a group led by a tour guide .
There are some reasons why .
Firstly , tour guide prepare the schedule about travel .
They do this regardless personal preference .
So we cannot satisfied about their schedule about travel , because the travel is our travel , not their .
As a result , a costomer may complain about their schedule .
So I preper travelling alone scheduled by myself .

Secondly , travel in group led by a tour does not provide personal time for us .
A tour prepared schedule whole travel time in advance , so they shoud punctuate the time .
As do that , they complish their responsibility .
As a result , we are very busy to obey that time , and we cannot have enogh time to enjoy in one place that we are very interested specially .
So we cannot appreciate a place or landscape .

I 'm sure that person each other must be having the thought of preference .
They 'll be unsatisfied about this schedule .
Thirdly , there are many people in a group , so I cannot have my time .
In my case , I like to picture the sight , enjoy and think about the place , and meditate alone and silently .
But , in a group , there are noise about conversation and voice of tour guide , so I cannot concentrate to my notion .
