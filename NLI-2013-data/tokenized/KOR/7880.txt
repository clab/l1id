When it comes to travel , travel itself is not to pass by some places or roads , but to pass the memory of past and to broaden each person 's sight , which is different from one another .
Thus I disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide .

Travel with a certain tour guide could make people informed about the facts of touring places .
But it never makes people appreciate their real values as much as touring by oneself or with a group of two or three .
I have once made a trip to Seattle , Canada .
There were about 100 people in my company and several tour guides .
In addition to the gloomy and murky weather there , what it made me frustrating , there were some restrictions that we , 100 people , should n't do such as going outside hotels and shopping .
I knew how much trouble it would cause if one person were missing .
Out of all exciting and curious feeling , it did n't make sense to me that we care and count the number of people missing if any .
So after coming back from the trip , I had not much memory with Seattle .
All memories about tour guides incessantly infinite information without moving around freely came up on my head everyday for quite few days .

In contrast to the trip to Canada , only with my sole body and my friends , I have gone to California from Texas where I was living then .
On the way to go to my destination , Los Angeles , we dropped by Las Vegas .
Everywhere I could meander was enough to inspire my sense of appreciation .
Although I did n't come to learn any information about travel place in detail , I was content with even small matter that I learned by looking , walking , and asking if I had any questions .
After that trip to California , I could not help but thinking about the fun memory and wholesome information I myself had asked ( so never forget ) .
Moreover I was so thankful for the time and nature , for very little thing .
I felt I enjoyed so much that I wanted to go again .

There is distinct different thing between traveling in group with tour guide and traveling in person without tour guide .
If I had made a trip twice with exact same course consecutively with a group and tour guide , it would have been boring and pointless .
The realing meaning of travel in my opinion is when I have refreshness every time differently even at the same route .
And the real tour guide is in oneself who is capable of seeking for the joy of the travel .
