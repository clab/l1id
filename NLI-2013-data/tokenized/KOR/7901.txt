Some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
However , in my opinion , traveling alone is a better idea .
Because I can manage my time by myself and save money .

First , I do not want to be controlled my traveling schdule by other people .
By traveling alone , I can make my own time schedule for my plan .
For example , last year , I went to Paris in a group led by a tour guide .
First time , I thought it was the best choice for me because I did n't need to book tickets , check the time and look for locations by a map .
But after a few days .
I realized that I was not the person who just like to follow other people and schedule led by a tour guide .
I really wanted to see paintings more in Ruvere museum , since there were my favorite master piece such as Monarisa .
But a tour guide did n't want to spent much time at there .
She guided the master peice and gave me only 10 minute .
I was so upset and embrassed , as I always eagered to see the work .
After the travel , I decided not to go traveling in a group led by a tour guide .

In addition , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more expensive that traveiling alone .
I compared two cases by a calculate and found that traveling alone is a cheaper choice .
I traveled around Spain two months ago by myself , then made a chart of spending money .
I figured out that by traveling alone I could save more than three hundreds dollars compare to traveling in a group led by a tour guide with the same situation such as traveling same days and visiting same places .
If I travel with them , I have to pay for a tour guide and the travel agency .

In conclusion , I firmly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best idea .
If I have a chance to choose traveling in a group or not , I will choose the last one .
As I can controll my plan and my habits and save money .
