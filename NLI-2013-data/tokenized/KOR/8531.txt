Actually , when we are students , we learn a lot of thigh without understanding exactly .
Can we say this situation is ok ?
It is controversial issue whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
Some people say that it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .
As for me , however , I dissents from this opinion because of following 2 reasons .
Without understanding thoroughly , we ca n't get a good score in the exam and we ca n't apply ideas and concepts to our real life effectively .

First , if students learned something in their school and they could n't understand well at that time , they could n't solve the problem in the exam about that topic .
Even though we can memorize facts what we learned whithout understanding for an exam , it ca n't be related our real knowledge .
So , right after couple of days , we will forget most of them we memorized before .
However , the facts which we understood are more impressive so it will stay our mind longer .
Therefore , compared to the the score we got when we understood ideas and concepts exactly , the score we got when we did n't understand will be poor .

Second , the matters which students learned and understood in the scools can be applicable to their daily life .
For example , imagine that in the ethic class we learned that we should give a seat to old people in the bus or subway .
If you totally understanded the facts , you will do same action in your real life .
However if you could n't understand the fact why you should do , you will not act like that .
Also , there is other example we can use the facts which we learned in the scool .
For example , when I watch movie about World War II , at that time if I learned history about the time and I could understaned the situation well , it will help me enjoy the movie well .
Like this , understanding idead and concepts can be useful to our daily life .

In conclusion , I think that just learning facts without understanding the meaning in the text is useless .
Because it will bring poor score in the examination in scool , also it ca n't be applicable to real life .
