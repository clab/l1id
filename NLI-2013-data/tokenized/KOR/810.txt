I disagree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
I believe that specializing and concentrating in a single specific subject is far more important for two reasons .

First , our life is limited .
We do n't have enough time to learn about every topics or subjects during our lifetime .
If we can live for five hundred years as turtle does , we can study and learn almost every accessible subjects that we need to know .
However , the real is not .
For example , if all students are educated in purpose of having broad knowledge without any indept specific knowledge about science , they might understand how machines operates but they can not fix in case the machines stop or are destroyed .
We do not want our children to have only shallow knoweldge in many subjects without their own specialties .

Second , I strongly believe that being equipped with specialized knowledge may result in inspiring people from using the specific knowledge and applying the knowledge to various other areas .
In my case , I have been very interested in collecting butter flies in every different kinds since I was five years .
This hobby made me read the related books and articles about insects as much as I could .
As I know about the insects more , I was more deeply inspired from their behaviosr .
As a result , I expanded my hobby to my major in college : biology .

In conclusion , I think focusing on a specific topic has a lot more advantages than being a only generalist .
Since our life span is limited and society is well diversified , we need more specialist than shallow generalist .
Also our culture and technology will be beneficial from the people who have profound , indepth knowledge on specific subject as the society 's environment become more complicated .
