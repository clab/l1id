Students can learn about many thing in school .
When students learn new thing , It is very import for student to know what they are leaning from classes .
And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts .
I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from the text books .
To understand the basic idea is not simply but , in my opinion , it can expand student 's abilities of thinking and creation .

Understanding new ideas and concepts can take long time and sometimes it could take few decades for students .
It can be problem to learning new things .
That 's why some instructor and students take shortcut to learn new things .
For example , when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio , so called ` Golden ratio ' which is believed as perfect proportion for every object .
It is very difficult theory to understand for specially freshman and it could take more than 2years , but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory .

Even though difficultes to understand the ideas , students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it .
It can be easy to creat new things with the basic concepts .
For instance , a musician who understand the principle of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and lythm using the basic music element .

Consequently , I recommend to understand the main ideas when students learn new thing .
Even though it is hard and difficult way to learn about new things , after understanding the notion from the basics .
It would bring great abilites to students .
That 's the main reason I study and research in order to understand the concepts in the class .
