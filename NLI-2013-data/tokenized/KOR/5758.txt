Nowadays , there are lots of cars around the world .
Perhaps there will be at least one car for each family .
Cars provide lots of benefits to us now , but it will also bad to all of us in the future .
More cars provide bigger problems to us .
Because of this there will be fewer cars in twenty years .

Firstly , car is the main source of air pollution .
Now there are thosands of millions of cars in the world and each of them are producing carbon dioxide .
If you see the city from the outside of the city , we can easily see the city is smugged .
The place where I live , which is Jakarta is one of the famous country for air pollution and have lots of cars .
When I go out with my car , I can not open the window , because of the air pollution .
If the air pollution is keep increasing , we can not live in earth anymore .
To decrese the air pollution , we have to decrease the numbers o the cars .

Secondly , the resource of the car is oil and the oil in the earth is limited .
As the oil is decreasing , the price of the oil will keep increasing .
That is the reason that oil is keep increasing in Indonesia .
I have been lived in Indonesia for 8 years .
The price of the oil right now is twice more expensive then it was in 8 years ago .
That is because in Indonesia , there are not much oil as before .
In the future , the price of the oil will be extremely expensive , so lots of people can not ride cars , because they can not buy oils , even though they have cars .

In conclusion , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars , because the oil and the pollution .
Not only leave it to decrease the number by itself , we have to try ourselves more to make it fewer for us .
