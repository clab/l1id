I disagree .
There are several reasons why I disagree with statement that says like young people do n't have enough time to helping their communities .
First , I think helping their community can be a great chance to learn about how to work .
I focus on having lots of experiences during the twenties all the time .
There is a word in korea , `` To be a successful man , you should learn and learn , get more and more experiences '' .
As this word , learning and having experiences is really important for any kind of person .

Besides , you can have a chance to get together with people meet first time .
From my personal experience , the time you should have to be more friendly is not easy .
However , after that difficult time , you can have new friends .

And also , I think people should know about their communities well .
Because , the communities are the places where people decide to live , they must have many imformations about their communities to do n't have a bad sight of their leaders and changes .

To do a new thing that is not concerned with your studies or works can be felt as a burdern .
Also some young people think it as a waste of time .
But if people change minds and encounter bravely , people can obtain new things and make their life more fresher .
these are the reasons why I prefer to helping communities than not to do .
