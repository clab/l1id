I do n't agree with the statement - the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Here I have a good exemple .
In january 2000 , I travled India participating in a group led by a tour guide .
Maybe fifteen people were joining in and one guide was joining in .
Group members should have gone to every place with the guide and each others .
It was very tired and sometimes had lots of losing time waiting for the late members .
However the guide explained specifically about the place we visit and it was ver useful , I do n't want to attend such a travel again .

One year later , in january 2001 , I visit India again alone .
Since a month before the travel , I had planned where to go , and when to move city to city .
The preparing time itself was very interisting and benefit for my ability to plan other long-lasting works .
And when I finaly arrived India , I was more free and movable .
And far the more , I could have met several local freinds there .
So we travled together several days .
And when I moved to another city , I could have another local freind and learned a lot about the social life of India more than my ex-guide .

I think planning their own travel and traveling alone is more benefit for young people .
Traveling is not just travling there .
It is including planning and studying about the country before travling .
And after traveling , to roll up the courses by notes and to think over it sometimes .
When group tour with tour guid it is n't quite easy to do it by myself because th tour guide do it for me. in this case the memory of tour is not lasting forever ,
