I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having a broad knowledge , it would help people find a better career and have a wide range of choices to choose from especially for students .

Having a broad knowledge of academic subjects , students will be able to choose a best fitting career for them .
For example my friend always had great interest in geology , but had no such class in highschool and could n't find anyone to teach him in such area .
Soon he changed his interest to studying history .
If he had more knowledge and a person to talk with about other subjects including geology , he could have been happier .

Specializing in only one subject , students might have a hard time finding a job if all the openings are filled with other experts .
By then it would be too late to start studying for a different subject .
Of course it is not bad to be an expert in a subject .
Actually it is a brilliant thing .
But I think it would be better if people were aware of alittle bit of everything than concentrating on a specific subject For exmaple studying in college , students should try to take many kinds of classes as possible to build information and then from the knowledge collected over the years , find a job that interests them most .

I believe having broad knowledge about various subjects will also help us out with surviving on earth .
There is a saying in Korean , ` a frog in a well . '
A frog in a bottom of the well only sees the little circular sky , which is opened at the top and does n't relize what is happening beyond .
The frog sees the little sky as everything on earth .
I agree that people should have broad knowledge of subjects than specializing in one specific subject .
