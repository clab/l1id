Through my experience , I can say that this statement is right .
Take a math for example , during my high school days , I had to answer lots of questions .
A math teacher explained the concepts first , and then made us answer questions .
If I could understand the concepts , it was not difficult to answer the questions .
So when I studied other subjects such as a chemistry and physics etc .
I applied same method , that is , understanding the concepst , first .

Here is another example .
In terms of parenting , especially money related , I think good parents is not the person who can give big money to their children but teach how can make money .
You might think this is a different story , but it is related to the topic , I think .
All parents want their children to be succeed and rich .
But ther are to types of parents .
One is just tell their children how they made money , and instructs to do something to make money wihout explaning what it is the concepts behind facts .
Another type wants to explain what is impotant and more eccential .
They know that facts will change , yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts , you can improvise to any circumstances .

Many young people inherit big money from thier parents , yet for those reason I mentioned above , lots of people do n't maintain their wealth .
Things is always changing , and I think along with the changing surrounding the facts can be chaged .
