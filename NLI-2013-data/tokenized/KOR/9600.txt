In my opinion , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well becase of creating a chance to be success and possibility of sucess .

First of all , if I am doing what I were already getting used to , I could never get a chace to make a lot of money or to sharply developed by myself because I would think same way and situations .
When we see a sucessful people , they tried several aspects and a lot of ways with the risks .
For example , I went to a seminar which Donald Triump opened in New York city two weeks ago , I heard that only people who catch a good idea and chance with risks can be sucessed .

Moreover , if I try to get new things , I believe I have more percentage of development .
There is an article pressed by Korea Times in 2006 that introduced a man graduated from Seoul university in Korea with bechelor degree sells a sandwich and Kimbab ( Korean Sushi ) .
He makes more than $ 100,000 per a year .

Therefore , I firmly believe that in order to get new chance and good idea and grow up my possiblity of sucess , I should try new things and creative experiences .
That is why I agree with that .
