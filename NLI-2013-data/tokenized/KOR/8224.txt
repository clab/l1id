In my experience , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts for students .
Even students know lots of facts about subjects exactly in the book or from other sources , it would be nothing if students do n't understand the concept of the idea in the subject .

Through my experiences and from teachers , understanding concpets is more worth than learning facts .
For example , when I was taking international business class , I was learning about the cycle of stock market that how it worked .
Before the test of that subject , I memorized all the facts that I learned from a teacher .
However , I did n't get good mark on the test because I did n't understand any concepts or ideas of the cycle of stock market .
Like this , even the teacher also thinks that understanding concepts of subjects are more important than the other things because if students do n't understand it or not able to apply their ideas to the subjects , it means knowledges that students learn from teachers or classes are nothing useful .

Basically , Understanding ideas are harder than learning or knowing the facts .
Students could learn the facts easily from the book or other sources .
On the other hand , understanding concepts require lots of reading and understanding what is happening in the subject .
Therefore , it is not important than to understand concepts because they do n't know how they use the concepts into the facts that what happens .
It implies that understanding just few concepts or ideas are more worth than knowing every facts .
Even if you do n't know a lot of facts than the other student , you could possibly guess the facts throught the concepts that you understand .

Due to these reasons , I think that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Some people would say that facts are more important than the concepts of ideas or subjects , however , if students are not able to apply the concepts or ideas of subjects into the facts , it means nothing to study the subjects .
