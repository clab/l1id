Have you ever try new things even though you knew risk is going to be extreme ?
There are a few successful people who take chances and try new things , Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
Two most reknown rival in the world .
Therefore I agree with the topic .

First example is Bill Gates .
In 2000 , Sony 's PlayStation 2 was the best game instrument in the world .
Any other companies did not even try to beat the power of PS2 .
However , there were one man who chellenge Sony 's PS2 .
Bill Gates demanded his workers to work on a game instrument .
And eventually , he created X-box .
He knew that risk would be gigantic enough to shut down his company for a while .
Despite of risk , his Microsoft jumped into a game industry .
In 2003 , Microsoft made Halo2 , which is considered as the greatest game of all time .

Second example is Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple inc .
In San fransico , California , the MP3 companies were amazed by sudden appearance of iPod , which can hold up to 1,000 songs .
Because Apple was a computer-making company , the other companies were surely surprized .
According to Steve Job 's biography , icon , he knew the risk was literally going to tear his company apart because of its financial problem .
Hw also knew that if he successes , it is going to resurrect Apple .
As you all know , iPod is success .

There are a lot of successful people in the world , but a few try new things and willing to take chances rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Bill Gates succees gaming industry while Steve Jobs dominated a fielid of MP3 .
There is no doubt in my mind that successful people try new things .
