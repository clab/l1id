A lot of people belive that It is more important for students to learn fact .
However , I agree with that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
Here are some seficific reason to support my opinion .

First of all , If people just learn fact they would think just result and they would care about only fact besides any processing .
When I was in high school I was that kind of person who just care about result and fact and I just studied and memorize a lot of things .
It seemed worked couple of times .
I got good grade until I was in freshman but I got really bad score in history class .
I was upset because I thought I knew pretty well about history so I complained to history teacher .
At that time , my teacher said that I logically remember everything for example If she asked `` Which year did it happen ? ''
I could answer but If she asked `` Which happened below that happend ? ''
I could not answer .
That is because I just remembered the fact I did not care about why I happended .
After that I changed a style of way to study and tried to understand concepts and ideas not only fact and I got higher score in history class and even other classes too .

second of all , If students just studyed fact It would also not good for their patient .
They would learn What is the begining and result .
Thesedays Lots of people can not be patient they can not wait only a few minute .

In conclusion , It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
