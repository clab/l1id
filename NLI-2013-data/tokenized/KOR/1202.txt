I think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
Actually people are studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
However , if people study many things in a same time , there can be many problems after all in a future .

First , if people study broad knowledge , they cannot know about their subjects in detail .
Since there are so much amounts of knowledge that people have to study , they can confuse the contents of the subjects .
For example , when they get some questions from some students or the other people , they can make a mistake by teaching something wrong because of the confusion about it .

Second , the meaning of expert can disappear .
If most people know wide knowledge of many fields , they are not an expert in a certain field .
Since they do not specialize in just one thing .
So , I can imagine one situation that if someone has a question about biology , the person can have a problem because there is no biology expert , he or she cannot decide where he or she should go , and cannot know who is the person that is specialize in a biology ..

Third , the meaning of major in universities or colleges can disappear .
Major is a subject that people choose to specialize in , by the way if people study broad knowledge , it is easy to disappear the meaning of major to students ans even the other people .
So , in the future , if companies want to hire some employees , they can be in a panic or confusion to search the person who is just good at their company .

Therefore , I think that people should concentrate on just one subject , so I want them to become great people who affect to the specific field and make wonderful output from their study .
