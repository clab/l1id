Everyone has different opinion on whether traveling in a group that is led by a tour guide or by ownself .
It depends on individual people 's various point of view .
However in my perspective , traveling in a group give more advantageous to me .
Because , it is convenient and easy to understand the country .

First of all , people can visit all the place with out any difficulties .
Of course it would be more interesting and advantureous to be travel by ownself , however traveling in a group give more profit to people .
In my personal experience , when I tralved alone to Australia , I had a trouble with the visiting tourism place , Because I lost my self in the middle of the town , so I faced difficulties looking for the place .
Moreover , I spend about two hours looking for a information center .
If I had a tour guide , I would had a wonderful vacation in Australia visiting many fun place , instead of wasting time on the road .

Secondly , people can understand and the country easily .
Although , peopl traveling without tour guide can also understand the culture and country , however , I believe it is more beneficial to have a tour guide .
When my mother and father traveled to the New Zealand , they found so many interesting thing from there , because the guide translated all the information that they visited and also , telling story that is relevent to the event or history .
Therefore my parents could understand the cuture and also some traditional story with out difficulties .
Thus , people , like my parents who can not speak the language that they are visited , can also learnt about the countrey with out any trouble .

In conclusion , for these reasons that I have mentioned above , eventhough , traveling arund the country with tourt guide might be more memorable and more fun , I think however leding guide i more advantagous to me .
No on can deny the importance of these assets .
