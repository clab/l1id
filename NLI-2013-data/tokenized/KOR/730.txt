Nowadays , the more the students are educated , the deepest knowledge they will have on their subject .
However , some of them may have two majors .
Which idea is good ?
In this essay , there are several reason why I do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

First of all , everyone has got the same time .
In other words , the condition to have an amount of study may be the same to everyone .
If you spend all your time on a specific subject , you can impove a lot rather than the person who spend his or her time on two subjects .
This is because he or she should devide the time .
Let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered : A person who only does economics and B person who does economics and politics .
Compared with A person , B person would know about politics more .
However , A person would know about economics more deeply than B person .

Secondly , in the sense , broad knowledge of many academic subject can be useful for normal lives .
However , you would lose the competetion with others who specialize on a particular subject .
A firm is a group of all the specialized people on their people .
In the other words .
there are several teams and sub-organizations classified in a firm .
it does not need one who has got narrow knowledge .
For instance , every unversity has got many departemts and would

accept the person who really want to specialize his or her faviourite subject .
