Many people believe that old people enjoy their life more than young people ; however , I believe that young people also enjoy thier life more than old people becuase young people have a lot of curious of life , besids they are more energetic than old people .

It is true that old people enjoy thier life more than young people becuase they already reitre from thier work ; In other worlds , they already support their childrean : as a result , they troubleing all the time with their money that they save when they were young .
However , young people also enjoy themselves .
Young people do not know much about the reall life ; In other worlds , they have a lot of curious that make them happy .
For example , when I was teenager , I had alot of curious of love .
I wanted know what love is .
One day I met a one man whose named Jack .
Jack also had a lot of curious of love .
we did not know about the love ; therefore , we learnd together .
We cried and laght together .
We learend how love make people to live in this socities .
we had a fun and enjoy .
Not only that we also learn how to get a baby .
Finally we married and having a three babied .
Which means my curious made me my real life .

Having fun and enjoy is very difficult .
In other worlds , If person who do not have a powere of enjoy their life , It would be very un happy to live .
For example , once upon a time , I had a lot of friends .
We always hit the pot .
we had a lot fun at the moment .
However If person who is not strong , It would be hard to enjoy that time .
For example , My grand mother and grand father had a lot of beautifull life when they were young becuase they never retired from the parties becuase of stranth ; however , they could not go to the parties today becuase they are too old to dance .

Both are true that young people and old people can enjoy themselve ; however , It is easyto enjoy their life when they are young becuase they are strong than old people and everthing is interesting to them .
