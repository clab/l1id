Recently , I had a chance to have brief meeting with Tom who just came back from the Europe trip and I was able to hear abou the valuable stories and funny episodes .
However , he strongly mentioned about the lessons given by the trip and also eagerly tries to advise me that without a tour guide tourists are capable of making a trip more interesting and memorizable .
Convinced by Tom , I do not agree with the statement that `` The best way to travle is in a group led by a tour guide '' due to two main reasons .
First of all , by depending on the tour guide , tourists dangerously lose their resposibilities and also deeply become dependent .
For example , let us say there are two babies who have been raised differently .
The first baby , Jimmy has been gifted with a couple who belive that babies must be raised with great care ; on the other hand , the Jeffrey has been raised by believers who desire their babies to bocome less dependable .
Most likely , Jimmy raised with great care will be excessibly so dependent that when he reaches to the time to work in a company , he will have many problems based on the disability to solve problems independently .
However , Jeffrey will be really strong and does give up in society even though adversities try to block him .

Secondly , without the tour guide , the tourists tend to more colaborate each other in a group and naturally make their trip more voluable and memorizable .
LIke I mentioned in the previous paragraph , being independent is really important element for people in society , but also knowing how to work with coworkers is significant .
According to Tom , he said that he had a lot of hard times to find places he and others in the group want to visit .
And he added that because poeple more tend to be collaborative and agreeable , they could have very successful and inerasable trip .

In conclusion , by depending on a tour guide , it will be little valuable trip in the reaons of the high cost for it .
So , if some wants to have wonderful , memorizable trip , he or she have to avoid a tour guide who probably takes his or her independence .
