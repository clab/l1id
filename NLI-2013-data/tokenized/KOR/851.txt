Many people have a different idea on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one specific subject .
People who support the idea insist that having broad knowledge of academic subjects is more useful their future life .
However I storngly dissagree the idea for two reasons .
First , speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time .
Second it can procure a professional job .

First of all , speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time .
That is because it make students to focus on one specific subject .
For example , when I was a unversity student , although I could choice double major in my university , but I did n't choice another subject , because my friend who chosen another subject by double major could not receive good grade .
If I choose another major , I would obtain bad grade .

On top of that specializing in one specific subject can obtain better job .
Specializing in one specific subject means being a professional .
In addition being a professional can get a high paying job .
Let me take my experience .
My major is an agricultural engineering .
I need to specialize one specific subject that it is a engineering .
When I was senior student , other students who were my classmates prepare Englilh in order to applicate company , but I did n't I just specializing
