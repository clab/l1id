Society in which we live is called Society of Knowledge that means that information is critical factor in society .
There is an argument about whether getting broad knowledge is better than having specific information about the one subject .
Some people might think that nowadays specializing in one certain subject is good because many companies want to hire persons who have a lot of information about the one subject .
However , I think that it is far better for people to get wide information of many academic because they can get the various ways to learn and build a variety of relationship .

First , I think if people learn and get the knowledge of many academic subject , they can obtain diverse skills to learn effectively and these skills are beneficial for them to live in changeable society .
In other words , while people get broad knowledg they can find the skills that are effective ways to input these information and arrange them in the brain .
For example , I had to get a lot of information of many subjects when I was a high school student .
At that time , I could improve my ways to get the information effectively and make an order to remember this information for a long time .
After graduation from high school , these skills is very helpful to me understand information of difficult knowledge of my major and I could get great grade in the exam in my university days .

Second , people who have broad information can make various relationship with other people who are involved in diverse fields .
According to the research carried by my university , people tend to understand well others if they are related with themselves a little .
So even though people get the knowledge some subject a little , they can understand others very well because they have somethings in common .
Today , broad relationship is very important fact for success in life .
So having broad knowledge gives people some advantage in their life .

To conclude , having broad knowledge of a variety of academic subgect is better for people because without having broad information they cannot set the ways for inputing a great amount of data effectively and may have hard time in associating with others who are in the different fields from them .
I am sure that broad information helps people to live more comfortable and successful .
