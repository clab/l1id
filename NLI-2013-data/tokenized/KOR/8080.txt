I agree that it 's important for stydent to understans ideas and concept that it is for them to learn facts .
there is several reason for that .
we do n't have to learn facts .
Because we can find facts and know it form internet or books or television .
and these days rather than know facts , understanding ideas and concepts is more important .

what is mean learn facts .
It means just know the mean of scientific phenomenon .
historucal truth .
this is knowlodge not can be wisdom or real means of study .
Now days , we can improve our knowledge about the most of things from the internet or books or television .
maybe long time age learn facts might be important .
because at that time it was hard to get information .
forexample hard to get books and more hard to read books .
only few class can read an wrote .
so sometimes the people had a lots of information and knowledge could get respect from others .
However , today is diffirent .
as I mentioned before .
knowledge is just knowledge .
information is no more valuable .
Cause every one can access to information and use that .
so now they we should put more value to understand ideas and concepts .

Then what is understands of ideas and concept .
If we understand the ideas and concepts it 's not only means knowing the facts but also means the ablilty to adjust the ideas and use it properly and practically in our life .
understnad ideas and concepts can directrly connect with our daily life .
So I can say understanding ideas and concepts are more importhat than learing facts .
Based on fact we already know and learnd understand it is more higher level of learing .
Also this ablilty is just what we want to improve in these days and sea of information .

So these two are the main reason that why I think that understand ideas and concepts is more important than just learning fact .
One is fact that usually we called information is now easy to access rather than any times of human history .
so just having information is not necessary .
And second , understand ideas and concepts is more precious becaus it can adjust in real life .
