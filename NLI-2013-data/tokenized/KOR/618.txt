It is controvercial whether having knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subect .

I prefer to the latter opinion because of two reasons .
The first is self-esteem and the second is specializing .

Second , having broad knowledge seems to be benifitial for entire life .
If you try to be a waking dictionary , however , you need to spend all times to get slight knowledge .
On the other hand , if you focus on a specific subject , you will be a specialist in your field .
In modern society , most company requires a specific degree in your field .
When I tried to entire a report teacher , the company required a highest level 's license .
Therefore , a specific knowlege needs to survive in this hardcore world .

First , self-esteem is the most important postuer in my life .
The specific goals give us a suitable motivation .
Without a goal , the motivation does not exist also .
When I was a high school student , I was a sports player and I wanted to be a national athlete .
Then I got a serious injury at a game .
Because of the injury , I had to stop playing game and change my dream .
My parents wanted me to study and become a teacher .
I accepted the proposal from them .
However , it has been my dream entire my life to be a national athletes .
I could not continue to be a thecher .
I returned to a player .
Some people can said me
