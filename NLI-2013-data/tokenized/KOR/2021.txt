I agree that this statement .
first of all , young people can travel anwhere without concerns .
of course older people also can do .
because of limitation of ages , it is difficult for older people to go to trip .
but young people have a lot of time to enjoy life .
for example I have been to around europe when I was middle school .
having a only back , a little of money .
That was amazing .
actually that was so unstable trip .
so this reason is that only young people can do .
there is something exciting to do for young people .
sporting events to watch , many concerts to attend , exhibitions to see for these thing , older people is so hard to experience it .

second , young people can enjoy party and extrem practice .
nowadays there are lots of party .
almost partys are should be all night long .
likewise practice too .
for example go to ski , go to snow board .
