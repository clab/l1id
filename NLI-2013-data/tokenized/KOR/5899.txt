There can be many opinion in this topic that twenty years later cars will be fewer than today .
Actually the oil and gas will be gone in 21C .
However I disagree with this statement .
Because car is developing very fast and in some years we can needed just 1liter of oil to go 30km .
Moreover before the oil and gas gone scientist will make new car that go by electricity or by sun light .

First , car is developing extemly fast .
Before 10years normal car can go 5or 6km by 1liter of oil , However now car can go 18km by just 1liter of oil .
And now car is developing very fast that , we can not imagine .
For example , their was a car that , go 5km per 1liter of oil .
And in the future car will go 30km per 1liter of oil .
Than oil needed 1/6 than the past .
However scientist calculated that only 40years left to use all of oil and gas .
However when car develop like this , the time will be spent 120 years to use all of oil and gas .
And of course you will change your car when you use 15 ~ 20years .
Than it means after 20years there will be a plenty of cars by development of cars .

Second , scientist will develop and make the cars that do not need any oil and gas .
Like electronic cars or sun light powered cars .
Now Vents the car company is developing the electronic cars and sun light powered cars .
And Vents company will make that cars in 20years .
That means in 20years people do not need oil and gas cars anymore .
For example , the oil and gas price rises up , Like 3times than now .
After that oil price rises up car company made electronic and sun light powered car .
Than what do you prefer to buy ?
New car or oil and gas powered cars .
Many people will buy the new powered cars .
Than there can be a plenty of cars on the streets like now days .

In my opinion I think there will be plenty of cars after 20years .
Because car will be develop very fast and scientist will make electronic car or sunlight powered cars .
And this will makes people to ride cars after 20years
