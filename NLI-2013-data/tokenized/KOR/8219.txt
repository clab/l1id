Many of people prefer to know only facts of something such as painting which is drown .
I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
There is some of reason .
First of all , it is to look only surface of stiffs .
Second , It is not impossible to improve their ideas .
I will descirbe the reason .

Firt of all .
it is to look only surface of stiffs .
For example , when I went to museum , I saw a lot of person who was seeing the painting quckly .
I think that they did not see ideas and concepts of painting .
They only see some artist 's original paintings and do not need feeling about the painting .
Second , it is not impossible to improve their ideas .
For example , When I studied math in high school , I only memorised the math 's list and rules .
So I could solve the math problems , but later I forgot all of the math .
If I reconiged the idea and concept of the math , I should have memorized the method to solve the math .

I do not like to know only facts .
It is to disgard to learn a lot of things .
First , It is to look only surface of stiffs .
second , It is not impoossible to improve their ideas to facts .
So when I go to musuem or exhibition with my children .
I will take time for long time to see the paings or someting because of thinking about the things to understand ide
