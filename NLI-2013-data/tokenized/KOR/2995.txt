I do not agree with the statement : Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Even though the young certainly are in better position to enjoy life in terms of their physical conditions , that is better health than the old , but this is clearly not the only factor to enjoy life .
Let me provide a few reasons I do not agree with the statement .

First of all , one great factor to enjy life is financial resourses .
To put simplest , it is very difficult or even impossible to enjoy life to the full without enough money .
This is obvious , because , say , who would pursue enjoyment f life under serious financial pressure or with constant worries about making both ends meet .
Under that kind of circumstances , it would be realistically very challenging to do so .
Since most , if not all , of the old have relatively more financial resources that they have acccumulated by years ' of employment , savings , properties , etc. , they are in better position to enjoy life than most young peple in terms of financial resorces .

Secondly , as they have lived long enough to know what life is , they generally have better or more appropriate perspectives , values , insight into life .
Quite obviously , with their extensive expereince of all sorts and education , learning , and so forth , they do have wisdom , which is so important and valuable in living a god life .
This is definitely a positive factor in enjoying life to the full .
