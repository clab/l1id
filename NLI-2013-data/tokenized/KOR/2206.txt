I do not agree that Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I can not support this idea for two interesting reasons .

First of all , young peole have less free time than old people do .
Think about the development stages of a human life chronically .
When they are students , erery day is full of something to do mandatarily such as homeworks , tutorials , lessons .
Also young parents are so hectic almost everyday earning money , working house chores , taking care of chidrens and being social to survive the difficulties which come into their lives .
Just during the holidays they can relax and enjoy some time , then they have to struggle again after those certain times .
It is hard even to think of themselves and their lives for a short time .
On the contrary , old folks are quite often seen taking a walk , reading substantial books , playing golf , crusing on a beautiful ship and so on .

Second , young people have less money than old people do .
Actually young group make a lot more money than the other one .
However , they have to spend a great portion of money they earned for a variety of purposes .
For instance , a young couple with children have no chance to save their money at the bank .
Especially , lump sum of money is spent on their children such as child cares , foods .
education stipends , clothes and so forth .
There is scarecely a chance to use some portion of money to be used for the family vacation .
That is the biggest opportunity to get away from daily mundane life and spend money to enjoy life including themselves .

On the other hand , old generations are spending money usually for themselves .
All the children are independent financilly , so they do not have to worry much about money as young generations do .

Most of old people eat out and make their lives even simpler .
With extra money in their hands , they can invest to earn more money to use .

I strongly can say that life is more beautiful when it is sunset due to the above reasons .
