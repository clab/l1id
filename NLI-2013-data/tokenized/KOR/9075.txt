I agree with this statement the importance of understanding ideas and concepts than learning facts .
Why do we learn ?
what is the purpose of learn ?
In my opinien , it is to develop from learning and to make advance .
Throughout several exemples will define the reason of importance of understanding ideas and concepts .

Business marketing is can be another exemple .
Before I learned marketing in the school and I have got good grade that time because I could well memorize everything learned in the class .
However when I had internship in the five star hotel marketing department I was embarassed , because before I did not understanding marketing concepts and ideas in ths subject I forgot almost knowledge before I acquired .
After that happening I read marketing book and tried to understand and applied in real marketing situation .
Through the process understanding ideas and concepts I could develope the marketing plan and apply marketin theories with modification the company situation .

There is another exemple with development of science , we learn sience in the school but if we just learn that it does not mean anything .
All facts in the textbook are like about history of sience .
With just the knowledge what can we do ?
However , through understanding the consept and ideas , we have some quriosities and exemin that we have developed science .
Acient people belived the earth is plat however some sientist understand and the ideas about that was not true they could find the fact eathis round .

Those tw exemples support the reason of agreement with this statement .
