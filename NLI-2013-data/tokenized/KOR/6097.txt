I agree with this statement .
because I think there is so many cars in this world .
so there is many problems occured because of that .
If people see this writing there are gets angry because they are use car everyday .
car is necessary item for human now .
but do you think that really car is necessary item ?
no .
It destroy the nature and also cause lot 's of biologic problem .
and also there are so many car accident .
I do n't know well about car .
but I know it cause lot 's of problems .
Now I 'm live in OSAKA in JAPAN .
lot 's of people using bycicle to go where .
also many cars there .
I think ride a bycicle is a good idea to protect nature .
and also I feel If cars get increase , people have to make a road or roadway for car run .
so they cut the trees or digging mountains , and so on .
If cars wo n't be decrease , there is no nature .
so I agree with ` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . '
.
