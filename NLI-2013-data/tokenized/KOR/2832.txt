Nowadays , we can see lots of young peole who go out with their friends , go to the movies and enjoy parties .
Some youth think that they are the happiest people in the world .
Youth are more active than older peole and looks enjoy their lives .
So they might enjoy life more than order do .
But in my opinion , old people really enjoy life more than younger peole .

First of all , old people have lots of experience .
They live longer than youth and have many different situations .
Sometimes , they had really hard time to recover their failure and they had unforgetable days in their lives .
Whenever they have hard time , they do n't give up and try to recover it .
And by having these experiences , they can enjoy their life .

Also , they have more friends than younger peole .
Because they 've already been to elementary school , middle school , high school , and college , they have really good friends who are always with them and help them a lot .
During living for a long time , old peole could have friends who adviced them whenever they had hard time .
So old people really enjoy their life with their forever friends .

Furthermore , in the case of adults , they achieved their hopes .
They have studied and had many failure to get jobs that they want to have .
By having those days , they experienced a lot and finally achieved things what they want .
So they can enjoy life more than young people .

Young people enjoy their life by playing and having lots of parties with their friends .
But older people enjoy life more and know how to enjoy their life because they have enough experience and more real friends .
Thus , I do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older peole do .
