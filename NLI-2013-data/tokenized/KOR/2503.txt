There is an argument concerning whether young people enjoy life more or older people do .
It is true that young people are hard to study and old people are hard to work .
However , I believe young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
In this essay , I will present briefly a reason supporting my opinion .

First , older people has not much time to enjoy as young people because adults has more concering than students .
Also , I believe there is reason why we call `` adults '' and `` child '' with different words .
Most of young people 's concerns are friendship or study problems .
They do not need to worry about money , work , food or far people 's relationship like older people .
Moreover , the older people 's concerns are not only those thing but also they need to care their child and parents problems .
So , they need to use remain time valuablly .
To exemplify thing that , when I was high school student , I never think about money , food , and so forth .
However , when I grew up to adult by officially , I start to think about those things .
Especially , I live alone since I studied in United States .
After all , I have to figure out how to use money efficiently , how to cook Korean food with various kind of ingridients , and caring by myself .
This experience let me know how my parents has hard time while caring me and my younger brother .

To conclude , I am generally agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people do because especially in my case
