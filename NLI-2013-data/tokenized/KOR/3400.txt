Nowadays , elder people thinks that young people does not give enough time to help their communities .
It is true that yonug people seems to concenturate more on their own concerns .
However , their are still lots of other young people who loves to help their communities and voluntier for hard social works .

First of all , in case of Korea , young students are anticipating for voluntiary work for 40 hours per year .
Even tough it is kind of an school homework , every students are helping their communities by visiting old peoples who doesnt have any relatives , or orphanage and some of them really feel pleased to help them .

Fortheremore , in Korea , when students attend universities they try to participate more actively because they can have more free time than before .
Not everybody but lots of my feriends are voluntiering to teach elementary to high school students who are not available to have a tutor without receiving money .
Some of them also visit elder persons who are lonly to talk with them persistently .

It is true that some young people seems to think only themself but their are still lots of young people how are helping their communities .
It is dangerous to overlead all the young people is selfish .
