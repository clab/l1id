First of all , I totally disagree with the following statement .
And the reasons follow .
One , by my personal experience , traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by on own .
Because the travel company which the guide is associated in always suggests expensive hotels with bad status and flights .
In that case we might not able to chance to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either .
For example , one of my friend went Germany from Korea with a flight costed more than $ 1000 through the travel company , but I went same country following week , less than $ 850 with getting season descount on my own .

One more thing is that guide always lead the travelers only to famous spots which are listed on the itiniery .
In that case you wo n't get chance to visit some nice place that only few people know .
I once had a chance to stay on a nice old castle in France .
Most of friends are jealous and are dying to visit their after saw the picture I took .

Two , traveling in a group may be safe sometimes .
According to the 8 years of personal traveling experience , most travel accidents occur in a group traveler .
Because when we travel in a group by a tour guide , people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide .
And that causes accidents such as robbery .
One of my roommate once traveled Spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated .
And he had paid attention .
But while he were doing so a stranger cutted out his camera .

Three , if we travel alone we get a chance to make international friends .
I still keep in contact with them and when they visit my country I guide them .
Finally , traveling in a gruop is not always good in many reasons .
