As a young person myself , to judge wheather old people enjoy their life more or less than the young people could result in a hasty generalization , since I have limited knowledge on older people 's view , but from the restrospect of my personal expereince , I think older people as an adults enjoy life more than the younger people , the teenagers .

In our society , it is the common notion that teenagers are less serious , resposible , and even ` intellegent ' when compared to an adults who are concieved as more experienced , wise and intellegent .
Consequently , the teenageer often face many social challenges that limits teenagers freedom to explore certain part of the society , such as voting or entering a bar/club .
It is undoubtful that these laws that forbid teenagers or underaged people from exploring certain things are necessary to some degree in maintaing order in society , but when the degree of limtiation becomes overwhelming and too great , it also limits teenagers attempt to pursue their enertatinment and enjoyment .
Unfortunatley , ther are many societies and cultures that encourage extremely stringent rules against the teenagers , such as some Asian countries like Korea and China , thus limiting teenagers ' options of enterntaining .

In Asian society , like Korea , students until high schools must follow extremely stict guideline that is proveided by the school , such as keeping the hair to certain length and style , wearing uniform that resemebles that of everyone elses , and preoccupying constant academic pressure provided to all students from the school .

Unfortunatley , in Korean society , almost all teenagers are going through this stringent lifeguidline and overwhleming pressure and expectations , which leaves no room for a brief hiatus or psychological respite for the teenagers .
Therefore greatly limts them from not only exploring the nature to develope appreciation for the nature , but also from pursuing their interest , passion , and entertainment .

Although this example only emcompasses the teenagers living in Korean society , there are so many other society , though in different degree , have some preconceived misconception that discriminates or limits teenagers from pursuing certain things and exploring certain part of the society .
Therefore , discouraging oppertunities for youngs to fully enjoy life as the adult who have more freedom , do .
