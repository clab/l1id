Today we are living in a world full of competition where companies expect a person with varieties of skills and knowledges .
When you face a problem you need to judge and decide fast and correctly .
For this you need to qualities , one is a depth of knowledge of a specific information of the field you work in .
The other is the ability to think creatively in relation to other sources of information .

So I think it is important that you gain broad knowledge of many academic subjects and later on specialize in specific subject which you are especially interested in and good at .
It would be great that you spend first and second year of university taking variety of courses in order to gain a perspective view of how the world , the society you live in is consisted and working .
After this you will have a more open view of the world and gain the thought of what it really is that you want to do with your life and what field you want to persue your carrier in .

With broad knowledge of varieties of subject and specific knowledge in special field you could think in depth and also be creative .
If one only specialize in one subject that person could easily be narrow minded .
It is quite clear that people think in relation to what they know and what they learned and practice daily .
A person without various knowledge of the world could not lead his/her life successfully in relation to people in various fields , because he/she could not understand the way of thinking of other people .

I am not saying that you should study every subject shllaow , I am suggesting that you take courses that would give you a large view of the society such as history , economics , science and politics so you can get help from these various knowledge when you need them in relation to your main field .
