My opinion is that , there will be less cars in use than there are today , in twenty years later .
I will explain these with three support reasons .

First of all , the new transport can be created .
Our life is rapidly improving by technology development .
There will be a car which fly the sky , or immidiate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second .
This new technology make people not to use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be convenient , and faster than today 's car .

Secondly , People use public transport rather than their own cars .
every year , people who are using public transport such as buses , trains and subway is increasing .
As the statistics , the reason why they take public vehicles are it takes less money , less time and convenient .
If they have own car , it cost much money to filling petrol , parking fees , taxes , car insurance and fixing the car .
As well as , the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing .
Also , there are terrible traffic jams every morning .
This is a reason why people use public transport rather than own car .
This will make less cars than today in the futhure .

Lastly , people are thinking about environment .
Everybody knows that car pollutes air .
Now a days , pollution is a big issue .
This harms plants , animals and also humans .
So , people are trying to reduce the pollution .
So , people try to use public transport .

In conclusion , my opinion is that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because our technology make new vehicle , people prefer to use public transpopt and people are thinking about environment .
