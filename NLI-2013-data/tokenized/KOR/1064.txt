As these society is very development , many academic fields generate in the university .
Some people argue that specialized education is efficient to develop the students .
However , in my opinion , studying various academic subjects is better for this society .

First of all , it is clear that the university students ' should have a various knowledge .
Accumulating many academic study , they would develop because they could use their knowlege in the fields that not only thier major but also other fields .
For example , I have a cousin who major is law .
Although he had hard to make a time to study other fields , he studies ecomomy also .
At last he could enter the big famous economic company as a lawyer .
He is so happy that the salary is high and he can use his all knowledge .
Many people arould him admire him because they belive that he knows a lot .

Furthermore , there is no question that the society is needed talents that have the various knowledge .
This world is not simple so only one field 's subject could n't do anything .
These academic fields consist that science with ethic , politic with media and education with psycology .
According to the believable reaserch , many university students are double-major because many company need a talent person that have more a two major .
I also did also tow major , journalism and Jepanese .
So I could enter a japanese newscompany .
