Some people may have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
As for me , however , I agree the specializing one specific subject for the following two reason : we can not only focus on the one specific subject but also have opportunity of excellent job .

Firstly , When I study in one significant subject , I can have important and detail information than have broaden knowledge of many academic subjects .
I do not have to waste time about the vast academic subjects .

In addition , If I study specific subject , I can have good job opportunity .
During the study about specific subject , I can have ready for presentation about job .

In conclusion , I agree with the specialize in one specific subject because of focus on the one specific subject and excellent job opportunity .
