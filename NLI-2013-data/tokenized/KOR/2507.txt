i disagree with the statement .
i know that older people works hard and have to take care of the family , bills and other stuff .
but student 's also have to study , obey parents and young people 's life is limited .

I born in Korea .
and my parents told me that i should be happy because I do not have to work .
but they do not know what young people are going through .
This was the typical life of mine before I come to U.S.A , go to school 8 , come home 3 : 30 , go tutoring from 4 until 8 , and then go to another tutoring .
when I get home it 's 1 a.m .
Maybe older people think that we live happy life we have no life for fact .
and reason that we do n't have life is because of adults .
We are told to do what our parents tell us to do .
they tell us if you study hard you will have better life later .

Moreover , younger people have limited life young people cannot work if their parents do n't allow them to work or drive .
olders life are not they can do whatever they want .
Their life is made by their choice .
Older can chose wether they want to work or not .
nobody is going to say , '' hey !!!
you have to work ! '' because they are adult nobody can control them .
they have their own right to be that way .
However , think about the young people like high school students .
They have to study for SAT , PSAT , ACT , TOEFl ...
etc. we also need to worry about friendship , look , love , and college payments .
So many thing to worry about and the pressure of the parents .

Young people do not have the freedom of choice and they are attached to lots of tests to worry about .
i bet old people do n't think that test is enjoy of their lives .
For these reasons , the statement should change like this `` Old people enjoy life more than younger people do '' .
