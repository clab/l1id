Many people have believes that young people today tend to spend less time to help their communities .
However , I disagree with the statement bacause there are a lot of ways to help other people and we ca n't estimate how young adults help .

To begin with , people can devote to their own society in different manners .
Without spending lots of time to work for others , they can dedicate themselves for the communities .
For example , one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor .
However , she actually did her best to provide helps through the Internet .
Since she took a variety of classes at her school , she could n't spend time just during the day .
After knowing this fact , most people felt sorry to her and regreted to focus on just quantity of the feasible time .

In addtion , helping others is not able to be observed , it also ca n't be estimated by an objective standard .
Of course , spending time would be a good basis , but it never show one 's all trying as I mentioned before .
To give an idea , here is the example from Kim-Jun , who is one of the famous lawyer in Korea .
He are renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedacation for the societies .
It is evident that he has limited time to make multiple things at the same time .
In order to overcome this problems , he has devoted for the community in various ways which do n't need to long time .
He provided a huge money for poor people and no one blames him although he dose n't spend enough time .

In brief , I strongly support that young people have still do their best for the world .
They have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying .
For these reasons , we should n't overlook how they contribute to our communities just because they have n't spent a lot of time .
