Some people say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing whar they already know how to do well while other people disagree .
In my opinion , however , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks because new things can stronly appeal to people , they are different from other things , and it is hard to be on the top with the same things .

Firstly , it is generally agreed that new things can strongly appeal to people .
When a computer was firstly invented , people extremly got excited about the new convenient machine .
Now most of people have at least one computer in their house .
Actually , the invention of computer was a sensation for the last century and also a good example of a new stuff that brought the success to the inventor .

Secondly , they are different from other things .
When a thing is different from all others , it gets its own speciality .
This might get extremly possitive effects or extremly negative effects .
However , it is worth to challenge for the great success .
Normally , successful people try to make or do new things while taking amount of ricks .

Lastly , it is very hard to be on top with same things because there are already a bunch of same things in the world .
It is very hard to win in the market with same stuff with others .
As time goes , people starts to look for something new and fresh .

To sum up , it seems clear that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already how to do well with three reasons stated above .
In order to be a successful person , they always try to make or do new things firstly rather than other people .
