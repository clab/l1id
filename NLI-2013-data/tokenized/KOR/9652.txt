People are frequently faced some difficult situations .
When they meet these circumstances , they act differently .
Some are trying to find other new ways and others are not .
I prefer the the first rather than other .
I believe this is the way to find better life in my life .

First , most of successful people willingly took risks .
For instance , Bill gates who is the millonaire in the world accepted the new situation .
He was a normal student in the university like other students but suddenly changed his way to find new one which other people did n't care about it .
What if he did n't do at that time , we could n't use the computer personally so quickly .

Second , the conditions we live in now was n't able to developed without taking risker .
Imagine , everybody avoid taking risks and stay where they are .
They never think which is needed to live better life .
They are not usually achivement and outgoing people .
Success never come to people who do n't seek to find it .

Third , taking riskers are always moving .
As soon as they are accustomed to deal things , they started to find others .
It 's not easy to begin with a new one .
Because it requires much attention from them .
But it is worthy to spend time on the new one even if it gives nothing .
After failing , they realized something from them .
And it helps to other steps .

I like the proverb that failing is the mother of success .
Without this mind , successful people cannot strive in the world .
I would like to be a one of the take riskers .
Taking risks needs to have challege mind but it will bring me a successful life .
