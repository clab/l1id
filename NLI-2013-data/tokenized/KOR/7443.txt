In every summer , A lot of people go Paris and visit many museums , and some of them just give a short look at every paints and sculptures .
It 's easier to travel in a group then travel by alone .
It 's , however , in doubt if this is the best way .
Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
The rationale behind this is that this kind of travel will never satisfy personal interests and it donse n't have flexibility in schedule .

The first reason why traveling by oneself is good is that a person can go and see what they want .
Unlike to touring in group , an individual can show specific interest on art or customs .
To illustrate , a newspaper article shows that a culture of an country has a lot of things that needs about a year just to see what there is .
Thus , It 's ridiculous to going through not participating on certain parts of an culture .

Secondly , taking a travel with nobody else allowes the flexibility in schedule .
Since it 's hard to know of a region without visiting the place , a person may feel like to change the time they spent on certain city or country rather than going other place .
According to an survey done in the airport , visitors who have n't come to a country before changed there perceptions they had before in many ways .
In this sence , traveling alone gives benefits to understand the country more deeply by giving changes to a plan .

To conclude , it is good to travel individually because seeing what they really want to see on a trip is important and allowes giving change in plan , even though there are good features of group traveling like time saving and being with a person who can speak languages foreign to a person .
If you are planning to join in a group , think once again if I 'm giving up the opportunities to broaden my sight for a little convinience
