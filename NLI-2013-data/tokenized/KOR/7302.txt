A plethora of methods of traveling are available these days .
The main two ways would be traveling privately and traveling publicly .
In other words , a person can travel by himself/herself or with a small group of familiar people and he/she can also travel in a tour guide .
Although traveling in a group led by a tour guide would allow me to gain more information about a particular place that I travel in , I would rather travel by myself or with my friends or family .

One of the requirements of tour guides is that there is a specific schedule that everybody has to follow .
Therefore , the people in a tour guide have to change their daily lifestyles .
When I went to a college tour with my friend , I had to wake up much earlier then I usually do and eat meals at times that I was not used to .
In addition , if somebody fails to follow the schedule , everybody else has to wait and the trip would not be as pleasant .
Consequently , it is better to travel in a private group .

Not only following a schedule , but also confronting unfamiliar people could be uncomfortable during a trip .
There are usually a myriad of people who are unfamiliar ; therefore , they cannot act naturally or be themselves with each other .
Since being comfortable is very significant and valuable in a trip , traveling in a tour guide is not preferable .

Another aspect of traveling that a tour guide lacks is the limit of time and place .
Since there are specific times and places , people might not be able to go somewhere they wanted to or stay as long as they wanted to .
Therefore , traveling with a tour guide is not an effective way to fully enjoy a trip .

Some people who consider traveling in a group led by a tour guide as the best way to travel might suggest that people can go to important and historical places that average people might not be aware of .
However , this advantage can be easily achieved by simply researching or reading books about a particular place .
As a result , a professional help from a tour guide is not necessary to accomplish the best experiences of traveling .
