I agree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
As much as time goes by , older people got more experience from the lives and they already have some fierce .
So many older people do n't want to try new things such as education , travelling , and culture , etc .
But the young people are different .
They are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things .
I usually get happiness from learning .
As my opinion , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people .

As time goes by , the number of entertainment increases .
In the past , people should work for living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of thier lives .
Young people have more opportunity to enjoy their lives than older people do .
For example , my father is very hard-worker and he does n't have free time for himself .
Sometimes , he looks like working robot .
I want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working becomes his routine life .
My father has worked hard for the living and he ca n't stop working even though he is enough rich .
I think my father is similar with any older people .
Goal of the lives is different between young people and older people .
So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .

I ca n't say which generation is happier than other generation because everyone has different conceptions of happiness .
It does n't matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own lives .
People should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve the happiness .
