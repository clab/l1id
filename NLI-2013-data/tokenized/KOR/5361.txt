I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are to help the company to commercial their own products to people , to make better profits out of it for themselves .
Then with that fact , it is obvious that they should make the products seem much better so that people would buy it more .

I myself , and everyone might have experienced it at least once in their life , that whenever you go to resturant or stop at the food place , you will see all these pictures of the food in the menu .
They all seem very delicious and look nice , but sometimes it does not taste or look as what you expected it to be .
Advertisements does this to make you eat their food , which will help them to make money for themselves .

No one will want to waste their money by purchasing anything wrong or bad .
People look for better and good one 's for themselves , therefore , advertisements try to show best abilities out of the products as much as they can .
Sometimes even by making up the fact that really does n't refer to the actual product , they compeat with other companies to sell more of their products than other 's .

In my opinion , it is understandable that they do this .
Since we already know that most of products are commercialized and exaggurated in a better and good way by the advertisement , we could avoid buying any fake or bad products .
Plus , it actually feels better for us to buy something that has more fancy and nicer advertisement than the ones that are not very commercialized .
Becuase by that we could know if the company is well and rich enough to support the product , which again will tell us that company has been making good profits for themselves by a lot of people who has been buying their products .
Therefore , I agree the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are which is true and understandable in many way .
