I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is group tourings led by a guide .

Of course , group touring can give several benefits : proving some good informations , making friends with peopel with different background , etc .
But as far as I am concerned , I believe that it is best to travel alone or travel with a few friends .

First of all , I like organizing tour schedule and preparing for travels .
I search good informations about my touring in the web sites .
We can have a lot of valuable information about cheap price hotels , affordable rent cars , or wonderful sightseeings .
In contrast , a group tour ususally makes me be very passive .
I do n't like being passive .

Secondly , I feel more free and comfortable when I prepare for my own travel .
Group travel ususally provides rigid time schedul and travel itinery .
But I enjoying freely choosing our schedul and places to visit .
Our schedul always can be adjusted based on our situations .

Thridly , I love driving my car when I make a trip to historical sites , parks and mountaints with beautifual scenary , or cutting-edgy cities such as New York , L.A .
In contrast , I cannot drive cars when I become a member of group tour guided by a tour guide .
Driving cars , especially in the highways , makes me feel relax and happy .

Finally , I do n't think that group touring provide cheap prices .
It usually need a lot of money to participate in group travel .
I believe , preparing our own travel can help us save a lot of money .

To sum up , group touring is not best option for me because it makes me feel more passive , less freee , and very often the price is so expensive .
I prefer traveling based on my own schedul and plan .
