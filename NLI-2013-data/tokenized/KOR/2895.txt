I am now 20 years old .
Older people would say I am very young to understand the society as an adult .
Younger people would say I am enough old to go out of family and experience the world .

In the year 2006 , many things happened to me .
I went to the United States of America for the first time , and have been a student in a college .
I had to experience everything in a foreign language , English .
Imagine , It still might have been hard if I was a student in my country , but i had to do in a foreign country .
It gave me new experiences in my life .
I had to make my decisions by my own .
My family and my friends were too far from me to give advise .
It was a hard year for me .

So younger people enjoy their life more than older people do .
Young people might feel the world and think in their own ways but they still stay in a particular places like house , school or by their friends .
They would also do n't know exatly what is happening in the world , What they do everyday is playing , hanging out with their friends and do their duty as children in their family .

When they grow up and become old people , they might have many things to consider in their lifes .
They have to consider about money problems , have to consider about their children , have to think about their future and so on .
Also they will find out that the world is not so easy to live than they were expected when they were children .

In conclusion , younger people will enjoy more their life than older people do , because they have less things to care about and does not know how hard the world is to live as a human beings .
