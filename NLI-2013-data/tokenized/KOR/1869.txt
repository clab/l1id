Last November seemed colder than usual , not because of the early winter gust winds , but because of one man who has been forgotten deeply in my mind for a year .
I stared at the portrait of this man .
Around me was only the mourning sound combined by high and low vocal sounds .
The man in the portrait-my father-was gone in my early life .

A Korean proverb says that the flower produces sweet fruits only after it loses its beautiful petals .
While anyone might expound its meaning thorugh the abstract-that perseverance thorough hardship is rewarded-I decided to illustrate its significant meaning thorugh various aspects of my life .
In a sense , it is the maxim that drives and motivates me not to be succumbed to people 's common pessimism toward people without parents .

Perseverance strenghthens my body .
Few years ago , I committed myself to a class to learn Kungfu .
But it was more than a leisurely hobby to sate some restless action film-inspired teenages ; it was a process of grueling training under a demanding master who was quick to rebuke any faults .
In a short time , every other student quit , having grown weary of awaking at dawn on weekends for the sake of physical exhaustion .
I knew better ; rather than be discouraged by the sudden trend , I reasoned that the benefits of continuing-physical fitness , discipline , and competency in legendary martial art-far outweighed the costs-foregoing the chance to sleep in .
Through the course of two-year regimen , I continued to learn , emerging with confidence ahead of those who had quit under exertion .
Rather than be discouraged by the past , I found the source of comfort and challenge by refusing to succumb to ethical temptations for the sake of physical convenience .

Perseverance tempers my emotion .
When cancer claimed my father 's life last year , it was inevitably difficult .
It was not a simple process , but I learned that the most important form of perseverance is hope .
Through hope , bitter memories of my father 's death were redirected into fond nostalgia of his life ; worrisome lingering on whta the had left uncompleted truned into excitement at the prospect of accomplishing his dreams myself .
A Korean trained businessman with a profound knowledge of international economy , one of his goals was to study in the United states .
Inspired by his rich life , I seek to fulfill our common goal in the United States to share there my own unique Korean living in China .

So far , I have shed many petals of tears and sweat .
Unlike many fellow students of mine at school , I 've lost the most important source of inspiration in life-father .
Unlike my friends , I , one of the young people for my age , failed to enjoy my life by not caring for the hidden inspiration of my life in the past .
I believe that the sweetest fruit yet lies at the time I become old myself like my father .
