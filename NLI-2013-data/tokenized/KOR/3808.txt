It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Some people say that youth are pay enough time helping their communities .
However , I believet that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities because they have a lot of assignments and most yougers are individual .

First , young people have a lot of assignmemt , so they can not spend their time helping theit communities .
Nowdays we are live in a floods of information .
Youngers should study lots of information .
It result to young peoples to have a huge of assignments .
They do not have enough time .
For example , when I studied Gangnamgu Library , one of the most famous libries in Korea , I always study with juvenile .
They studied their school assignment too hard .
Thus , Youngers do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Second , most young people are individual .
They do not pay attention with their communities .
Even they do not have affection about their parents .
Modern society brought an individual circumstance .
People do not worry about surroundings except oneself .
Accoding to the Dongilbo , one of the most famous research center in Korea , 76 % young people do not know their neighborhood .
Even they do not care about that .
Thus , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do not care about their neighborhoods and surroundings .

In summary , youngers nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities bacause they have a lot of assignments and they do not pay attention .
