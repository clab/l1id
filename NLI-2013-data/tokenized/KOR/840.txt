With the help of the internet , transportations and communication techniques , people are getting closer and closer from the viewpoint of space and time .
As a result , we cannot help intereacting each other very deeply every day .
Therefore , I support the idea that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because the former is preferable in this competitve world .
It will enhance people 's competitiveness and make people richer

First , more and more people are competing each other in this rat race .
It is because we are living in a global age which connects us to other people across the nation .
It means that we have to compete with more people than ever .
Accordingly , without concentration on one area , we cannot win the race .
For examle , ` Baskin Robins 31 ' , my favorite icecream brand got a lot of popularity in my country .
It is because that it specializes in one item , icecream .
As a result , it provides customers with a variety flavors .

In other words , speciality improves the competitiveness .

Second , specialty also brings more money to people who succeed in paying attention to a specific field .
These days , it is often reported that experts , wherever they work , get paid a lot more .
It is because that they are such specialist that they know kind of ` know-how ' and creative idea in certain field compared with aveage people .
This illustrates that specialty make people more lucrative .

All things considered , It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in on specific subject .
