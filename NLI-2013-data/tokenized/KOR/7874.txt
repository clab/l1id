Some people may think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However I disagree the statement for two reasons .
First , individual traveling is more interesting .
Scond , the tour guide is not always leads some good places .
Let me explane in detail .

To begin with , backpacking is more interesting in travel .
It is obvious that group tour is convenient , but I ca n't do myself in that case .
And I ca n't improve a sense of independance .
Let 's take my experience for an example .
When I was sophmore , I had planed to travel to easten-asia .
That is the first trip to out of Korea , thus I was too confused everything such as making passport , reserving ticket and scheduling my trip to think the method using the traveling company .
However I decided to do own my on .
Finally I traveled to Thailand and gained valuable exprience .
After that I can do it everything myself and improve a sense of self-help .
In this sense a group tour is not the best wat to travel .

Next , some bad tour guides leads commercial place to make money rather than good place .
In the past , people does n't go travel to other contry through the travel company .
Now , many peolple use tour-agency .
Thus there are so many side-effects .
Let 's take my friend experience for an example .
He traveled to Baly with his wife for marrige tour .
Likwwise other people , he used a tour guide in travel .
First day , the guide leads beautiful place in baly and gives interesting mentions he prepard .
However the second day , the guide leads the coupple to a treasure shop and silver shop and explansed that these goods are most popular in this country and persuading him to buy the good .
So he disappointed greatly .
this shows that the guide is always good .

In conclusion , a tour guide is not the best way to travel for the reasons that
