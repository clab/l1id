I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For example , my family had a apple tree in our backyard .
When we get the apple from the tree the apple had worse looking than from a store .
Another example is I have heard that a company for selling foods , which are Manto and Dimsom , made the foods just good taste and good-looking , but not good for health .

First , when I was in my elementary school in Korea , my family had a apple tree in our backyard of my apartment .
We never gave it any chemical pesticide or never do advertisements .
After I graduated from the elementary school , my family and I could get nine apples from the tree .
Three of them were already eaten by insects , so we could n't eat the tree of them ; however , others were fine , but it looked really worse than the apples in a fruits store .
Even if the taste of my apples was better than of the store 's apples , I felt my apple 's taste is worse because the appearance of my apples made the apple had bad taste .

Second , I have seen that a company for selling foods , Manto , Dimsom , or etc. , made the food by the wasted trashes from restourants in the news .
When they made it had a good-looking , they did advertisements , also they put some chemical materials to make it has good teste .
So , the food from the company had really good taste and good looking , but extremly bad for one 's health .
There are still some companies like that in Korea .
Even though the food is not already eatable , the advertisments make it eatable .
For that reason , I agree that advertisements make products seem better .

Because of my expriences , the apple tree and news about ` Trash Food , ' I agree that the most advericements make products seem much better thatn they really are .
But , I also think the advertisements is necessary because I make the food taste better by giving good appearace .
