Today , we can see a lot of people who are around us enjoy their life happily .
Some people go abroad and have good experience .
Other people go to the beach and relex .
However , I think , most of people who enjoy their life are order people .
In my opinion , young people do n't have many opportunities to enjoy their life .

Firstly , most young people have to study for their future .
They have to go to school and stay in school for half of the day .
So , they do n't have many chances to play around .
For instance , I am in grade 12 and go high school and so busy about doing a lot of homework and choosing an university for my future .
Although I have no time to enjoy my life , I went to Rocky Mountain with my friends .
However , the experience was not that greate because I had to keep thinking about school and university .

Morevoer , order people can enjoy their life more than young people because they have much time to enjoy .
Many order people quit their jobs and have enough money from the jobs to relex .
So , they can travel around the world for a long time rather than young people .
For instance , my homestay mom 's mother is staying in Canada for four months .
She can stay even for a year because my homestay mom provides food , money , and room for her .

Furthermore , young people usually do n't have enough money to enjoy their life .
Usually , young people get money from their parents .
Because of that reason , they may not have enough money to travel or enjoy .

In conclusion , order people enjoy their life more than young people because they may have much time to enjoy their life , and possess not much tasks to concern .
However , young people have to attend school , need to study all the time that they have , and get not enough money to enjoy .
So , young people do n't have many chances to enjoy their life .
Therefore , order people can enjoy their life more .
