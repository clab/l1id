Many teenagers seem to just hang out with themselves and not help their communities .
However , this is wrong .
Students are actually helping the community they live in with small things such as keeping the community clean , and helping the elders and disabled people .

These days , almost all the schools are requiring the students to go to the government-related areas and help others for certain hours per year .
Because they get their marks off the grades , most students go to where the elders are , or to kindergartens to help out community people by cleaning and helping chores .
For example , a students will go to the daycare center and help the teachers -- or leaders -- take care of the kids and entertain them .
Helping them serving snacks and doing dishes will be another way to help the society .
Also , once in two weeks , students are to go outside the school building and are required to pick up small trash and garbages that are litered inside the school .
Even if it is just inside the school , it will help the school to look clean and organized .
Just like these , students are helping the community behind the adults ' eyes .

When you go on the public transportation , such as subways or buses , it is easy to notice a young student giving up their seat to someone who is carrying a heavy object , or someone who is old and hard to support themselves by standing .
This small thing can also be a big help to the society .
Others will learn this act from this student and will repeat the same act to help others .
The student will also feel warm about what he/sho had done .
Another example is that teenagers can help foreigners by just answering them how to get somewhere very kindly .
It is often for students to help others is minor things , but adults just think that the students do n't help the community at all .

There are more things that adults could help for the society , but not much for the young people .
Young people do n't have enough money to help others , when adults do .
They do n't have abilities to help other people in such a big scale .
Instead , they help others with minor things and be satisfy with it .
People who say that young people do not help the community should think about themselves if they help the community within their abilities .
