Nowadays , most people generally spend a lot of time in their company for their work in daytime .
Although they are busy all day long , they have their spare time .
I disagree with the position that the young do not have time to helping their communites .
For this statement , I have two specific reasons .
Helping another people do not need a lot of time and the young should reduce their waste time .

First of all , helping people , there are not needed many time .
And the important thing is the mind for helping people .
For example , in recently , public advertisement expresses the only 3 minutes needed for helping people , for instance , helping the old with the heavey broden when people walk on the street to go to the work in the morning or to go to home at night .

Next , if young people reduce their waste time , they can do more meaningful work like helping another poor people .
After working , most people tend to spend their time watching television and take a nap .
For example , whenever they have a spare time , if they help poor people and older people , they soon feel they are not alone anymore .

In finally , the young should have spare time to help their community .
They can make time for helping another people .
