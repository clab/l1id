It is controvertial whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Some people disagree with the idea that it is impossible to reduce using cars because today we are so depend on car .
However , in my opinion , I agree with the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
First , in reality , now , we are faced with the lach of oil or any fuel .
Second , by developing the technique of science , we may invent more innovative transportation to go to all around the world .

To begin with , now , there is state of lacking the any fuel .
We efforts steadily to find new fuel like hydrogen dioxide fuel , nuclear energy and wind power energy .
However , these could not be replace of oil fuel .
Also , in the world , there were still war to have the fuel priority .
According to the Korean broadcast in Seoul , in the 50 years , there were no fuel resources in the world .
In this sense , car which depend on fuel could not be used in 20 years .

Next , getting development in science , our scientist would invent a lot of innovative transportation .
Maybe , as we seen in `` Matrix - which deal with the future - , that situation would be coming .
People could move in just second as the girl in Matrix and could move using machines like rocket .
In addition , we could be fly in the sky .
If the scientists can make up the circumstances which does not have gravitional force , we could move freely the side to anothe side .
This is not familiar with me , now , however , in 20 years , we do n't know what happens are occur .
This clearly shows that in 20 years we could use another transportaion .

In conclusion .
I agree with the idea that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the reasons that I mentioned above .
First is lack of fuel and second is our scientist could invent more convenient transportation machines .
