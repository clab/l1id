Did you understang everytime your learend everything ?
This subjet is It is more important for students to understang ideas and concepts than it is for learn facts .
In my opnion I prefer important for students to understang ideas and concepts .

First , do n't worry by not your understanging fot study and understanding .
every eachother have each opnion and think so we can not contorl their think and understanding , so we need to say our opnion and we need to know why ?
and how ?
and understanding .

Second , we are different , every pepole is different , for example color , language , culture and custom so we ca n't understanding , i have experience , wheh i was came to first visit USA , i do n't know everything , and than i think if i eat good food and i give some food for my friend .
i think he like this one , but suddenly hi throwout everything .
so i 'm very surprise .
and then he said me our country can not eat pork , i really mistake .
so i understanding everyboby is different , and everytime nerver forget and think .

Futhermore , thinks and behavior , and ues .
If you learend something you can use good work , but you can also ues very bad work .
for emample , someone theated something , but you can understanding different or mistake , you can use tealent for your bad way .
this is very bad and sad .
so we need to know good understanding .
and thinking about possitive way .
