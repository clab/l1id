Some people like to travel in a group with a tour guide .
On the other hand , others like to travel with only friends and family .
Tour guides bother travelers from traveling freely .
Also , in many cases the people in the group traveling together do not know each other , therefore it is less relaxing .
Moreover , hiring a tour guide is expensive .
Overall , traveling without a tour guide is a better way to enjoy a trip .

First of all , travelers are unable to freely go where they want because the plans are already made .
Tour guides are people that ` guide ' travelers .
These people make plans beforehand and guide people according to it .
Thus , this bothers travelers from taking time in a new place enjoying themselves .

Second , it is hard to relax .
Relaxing is the actual meaning of traveling .
However , most of the time , people traveling with a tour guide also go together with many people they do not know .
This is rather uncomfortable than traveling with friends and family .
It is difficult to forget about daily life and relax with lots of new people around .

Finally , it is expensive to hire a tour guide .
With the money to hire a tour guide , travelers can spend it on other activities .
For example , people can buy more gifts to give friends and family , enjoy the famous dishes of the region , go to museums and watch plays .

To sum up , going on a trip led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
It is better to travel with friends and family to get some relax in a long time .
Adventuring a new place is the reason people enjoy traveling .
Wandering around enjoying and seeing new things with the money to hire a tour guide will leave a more impressive memory of the trip .
Consequently , traveling without a tour guide lets travelers have more fun .
