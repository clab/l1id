We see uncountable several advertisements in our daily lives .
People use many tools and methods in order to send information contained in several advertisements , and spend much time and money in order to make them attractive to purchasers .
Why do they fervently make their efforts to make that many advertisements ?
That is because the advertisements have huge influences for customers .
Then , what is my opinion about the statement ?
I strongly agree with the point that most advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are because many skills for making advertisements have been developed , and production of advertisements has a clear purpose .

Firstly , we should pay attention to the development of various tools and skills for production of advertisements .
Many people may feel the fascinating development of advertisement making methods , such as computer graphic design .
In my case , I esperienced that advertisements make it possible for products to seem better than real one .
I ordered a brand new mp3 on web site .
It was awesome , and looked the best among which I had ever seen .
I ordered it without hesitation , and I received it a few days later .
However , the mp3 looked so poor .
It was not what I had seen on web site .
However , unfortunetely , it was exactly the one which I ordered .
I came to realize the power and ability of advertisements .

Secondly , I believe that the statement is a main purpose of advertisements .
Many people , who request advertisements or make them , try to achieve that purpose .
They spend huge money and time in order to make a great advertisement to make their products seem better .
According to the principle of market , if advertising company do not make a good advertisement as much as it accomplishes the purpose of the advertisement , any advertisement cannot survive .
Therefore , as a result of that , we would be able to see gradually developed and attractive advertisements .

In conclusion , I am sure that advertisements can make it possible for products to seem much better than its reality .
