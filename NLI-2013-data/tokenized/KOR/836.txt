Whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject has been controversial among many peoplr .
Howener , I basically disagree with the statement that broad knowledge is better .

I have two reasons for this .
This is because and Most of all , the age want specialist than generalist .
As a matter fact , too many people know a lot of things , but they do n't have deep knowledge .
Furthermore , without specialized knowledge , one cannot succeed in some field .
Accordingly , we should focus on the specific subject .
For example , if student just learn about general idea and do n't study in-depth information , they would cannot fantasticaly function in their field .
From my thinking , I am sure that concentrate on specific subject is very very important .

In addition , by focusing on some narrowed field , one can build his or her power of concentration .
Generally , poeple who do n't have power of focus are not likely to success in their field .
Besides , when we focus our body and mentality are strengthened .
Therefore , it is wise for us to concentrate on the specific subject .
It is reported that 79 % people in the U.S live healthy and soundly when they focus on the specific subject .
From this data , I realized that it is essential that concentrating on the specific subject .

To sum up , I strongly support the perspective that it is better to have one specific knowledge than have broad knowledge .
This is because it helps to succeed and live healthy .
Therefore , having the specific knowledge is one of the factors having positive influences on our education ,
