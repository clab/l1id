These days , there are the growing numbers of people tring to enjoy their life in various way .
Some peeple say the young people enjoy life more than older people do , while others disagree with this .
In my oppinion , I disagree with the statement because I think the older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling the world and playing sevral kinds of sports .

First of all , old people enjoy their life by traveling many different countries .
As you may find on researchs of sevral TV stations , the number of people traveling other countries than thier own countries are highly increasing every years , and most of them are seniors who do not have particular jobs while other are busy to care their business than enjoying their life .
Due to they do not have their job to spend most of their time , they get a lot easier to travel arround and enjoy thier life .

Secondly , the older people enjoy thier life by playing many kinds of sports .
With the development of medicine and health supplies , older people are getting much more stronger than before .
These developments help older people to maintain their body condition enough to participate many sports activities .
For instance , I have seen many seniors playing squarsh game very well while I work out at my fitness club .
As I mentioned before , they have much more time than younger poeple who have to work hard to keep up thier jobs .
Thus , older people can spend more time to consider what kinds of sports they like to learn , and how they are going to enjoy their life too .

In conclusion , I disagree agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I think older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling arround and learning and playing many sports .
If people have more spare time when their are young , they can enjoy life more .
However , they are still busy to work hard .
