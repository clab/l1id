I believe that we should attempt new trials and take some risks for more successful life .
Because trials and errors let us realize our limitaions , and so , we can correct our errors and try to overcome our defects .
In addition , though there are some dangers in attempting new works , it creats unexpected results , gives great inspirations and makes us stronger and better .

I think that most people have limitations physically or mentally or financially .
If we just satisfy with our current situations , we never improve our life and never experience better and hidden happiness .
For example , Beethoven , a renowned musican and a great human , had an ear disease .
He did n't even hear audience 's loud applause after the premieur of his last symphony .
However , despite his severe sickness , Beethoven tried to overcome his defect and created many new and innovative classical music .
Due to his efforts , today many people hear many exceptional touching sounds .
If he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself , not only he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet many great music .

Moreover , I think that crisis and danger sometimes produce unexpected results and make us stronger and competent person .
For instance , many scientists have researched some risky and doubtful facts and they have found many wonderful solutions .
Thses discoveries have developed science and our life .
In addition , in my experience , when I faced difficulties in my job , I did not avoid them and tried to resolve those problems .
As a result , I could find various solutions and develop myself into a competent staff .

In conclusion , I do believe that trials and risks make people stronger and better .
We all have a brain and a heart .
I think that we need to use and devleope them through efforts to overcome our current obstacles .
