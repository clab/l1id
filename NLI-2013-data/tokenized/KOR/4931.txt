` It really works ' this is what i can hear every commercial .
Every products are not best in the world , and sometimes it does not work .
However in the commercial every goods are fabulous .
In my opinion , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than their real .

Advertisements exist for advertise the products .
Even though , the product is really good .
there is a limit of until everybody know about this product .
Because of this reason , people want to make commercial .
For instance , near my school , there is a really delicious restaurant .
Almost every my school students know about that restaturant .
We get imformation from our school friend .
However , my friends whose are not attend my school , never know about that restaurant .
The other day , the restaurant itroduced in famous TV show .
After that the restaurant is all the time crowd .
Even my another school friend know about that restaurant .
The restaurant has a purpose when they are on the show .

It need to provocate customers .
Many people buy products that they do not need after watching commercial .
The advertisement need to stimulate to customers .
Owner of products wants to sell products as many as possible .
Getting to result , they need more strong tihings than their real products .
Therefore , they make their products more fancy and looking good .
If it works products can earn lots of money .
When i was young the castle for doll was so wonderful in Tv commercial .
I keep asked to my parents to buy that castle .
Finally i got that , however it was so different from the commercial product .
Colore was different and there was no bell and It was not automatic .
Even though commercial disappointed me , it was enough to make me buy doll castle .

In conclusion , most advertisments make ptroducts look good better than real , I think that advertisment has a purpose .
Because commercial 's initial work is advertise to people and via stimulate customers make them buy to products .
