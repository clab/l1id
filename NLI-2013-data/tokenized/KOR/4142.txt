I agree with the following statement .
There are some young people who would volunteer to work for his or her communities , but the number of young people who would not give enough time to helping their communities is increasing faster .

The first reason that more young people would not help for the communities is that there are many ways to spend your spare time .
You can play games , play sports , watch television , or do whatever you want to .
Quite a number of people especially like to play computer games , and watch television .
A few months ago , I have read an article about this problem .
It showed that the percentage of watching television and playing games has increased after the law of working 5 days a week has been put into the reality .
So , instead of wasting time on games and televisions , we should try to help our communities .

Second of all , we have to study hard for our future .
Nowadays , there are hardly any jobs that you can get .
In order to survive in this cruel society , you have to study , study , and study and graduate collage with a degree .
Then , it would be easier for you to get a job .
The pressure of studying does not give you any free time to helping your community .
There should be some change in the curriculum of teaching and studying .

Furthermore , many things have changed from past .
It also made people to change .
Hundreds of years ago , our ancestors would have helped each other out when they are put in a hard situation .
But these days , people think only about themselves , instead of working as a group , as friends .
This is an improtant thing that we should learn from our ancestors .

Young people have strong powers and intelligent brains .
But they are using it on things that are not important .
Helping communities will out our communities to grow to be a better place to live .
