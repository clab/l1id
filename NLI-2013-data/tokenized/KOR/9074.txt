I believe that it is always better to do such things than just read or look at .
I definately disagree with it is more important for students to know the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
I feel this way because , just to learn the concepts students might lose their attention or interests , and to learn facts is very effective .

First , students often prefer to do some activities than be in the class , which means that if they learn only the concepts and ideas will lead them to not concentrate on .
For instance , in the computer class , most students do not really want to know how the system operates , why it is , and so on .
It make them to lose interesting .
On the other hand , if they go on to the computer and look how it operates for real and use computers , it get much more attention and interests to the computer class .

Second , to learn the facts is much more efficient to most people .
Education is always like to know what kind of educate can be more effectiveness on it .
The answer for this is doing `` real '' things .
Let 's think about the brain .
In what way do you remember things better ?
Read the passage , learning all the concepts , or do something with using all your five senses and exprience ?
I believe that experiecne helps you to remember meterial much better .
Here is a good example of that .
Before I came to Canada , I did kno nothing about computers .
Since I had to use computer to get done my homework and to chat with friends back in korea , it made me to be so familiar with computers .
Now I can even fix up and tune up the computer .
If I only read books about computer and tried to unerstand concept I could never be that good at it .

As the conclusion , understanding concepts might lose people 's interests , and do real thing is much more effective than other stuff , it is more important for students to learn facts than understand ideas and concepts .
We have to realize what is always better in what ways and try to bring them in the real world .
By having mroe activities and experienced will make education to be a lot successful .
