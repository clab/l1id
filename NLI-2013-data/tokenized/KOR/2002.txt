I am very interested to discuss about this topic , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I disagree about this topic , because young people are a lot of learn for their better life , young people 's body is more healthy than old peopel so they have to work hard for their future .

There are many imformations that we have to know for our better life .
when people is young , their brain is more active and knowlege so the young people study and learn more when their brains are active briefly .
And when we want to live more comfortably in older .
we have to make a lot of money for good when is older .
There is reason why young people have to make money in youth , because it is easy to make money and to have passion .

Another reason why I disagree about this topic is people work hare for their future when their body and brain are healthy .
The young people have more health and powerful , so they have to work hard for their country and themselves .
If young people do n't work when they are young , there is nothing to work for their countries .
the world is made by young and inteligent people .

Many young people want to enjoy their life when they are young , but if they enjoy their life when they are young , there is no time to work hard and to make money for themselves .
Enjoying their life is not late when they become old .
Many people needs people who have talent and inteligent .
If young people work hard and learn something , they are going to be more comfortable and more joyful when they are old .
These are the reasons why I disagree about young people enjoy life more than older people do .
