About this topic , either options have disadvantages and advantages .
If i choose one side , i will choose learning broad knowledge about many subjects .
There are three supporting ideas about my choice .

The first reason is broad knowledge about subjects helps people to have enlarged work choices .
If i know knowledge about science , marketing , and bussiness .
When i invented good products , i will start bussiness and marketing by myself .
I can be an owner of company , scientist etc .
These broad knowledge helps me to get more choices of job than when i just know about science .
Furthermore , it will bring more financial profits and better reputation .

The second idea is extent knowledge substitutes people 's work when if people fail their main subjects or works .
Let 's say i just know about painting industory .
When the other substance , which will use instead of paints , is invented , i ca n't get any job because my major knowlegde becomes useless .
However , if i knew many knowledge about many subjects , i can work at the other areas .
Therefore , learning broad information about subject is better than just learning one subject .

The last reason is it helps people to stand out at many places .
If i just know about science , i can show off when people talked about science , However , except science , i ca n't show off my ability because there are none left about the other subjects .
However , if i know many parts of subjects , i can show off my knowledge everywhere and everytime .
It helps me to live more confidential , Moreover , i can self-satisfy .

Because of these three reasons , learning just one subject is not as good as learning broad knowledge about many subjects .
Therefore , i think that if people already learn about just one subject , i wish they got an attitude to pay attention to other subjects also .
