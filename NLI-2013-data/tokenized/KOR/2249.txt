I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people is younger than old people and I think young people are teenagers to about 20 year-old-people .
Teenagers have very healthy bodies .
So they can go many different places .
If they have many trips , and camp , they will experience many precious memories .
Maybe they will experience with their friends and families .
Also they can make freinds in the camps .
But old people ca n't do that .
They are maybe 50 to 70 year-old-people .
So most old people have some disease in their knees and shoulders .
Their healthy also very bad .
Some old people also do n't have friends except their neighborhood .
If he or she is very healthy , they do n't have much money .
They ca n't go trips for other countries .

Young people have lots of dreams .
So they can enjoy their life .
They can be singer , teacher , doctor , and actor ( actress ) .
They will try their best .
It is very important .
Dream is make people alive .
In the world , every teenagers have dream , and they make their ways .
However , most old people do n't have dreams .
Some pool old people is waiting only death .
They are so pity .
If they have dreams and hope , they can heal their diseases .
I believe it .
If someone does n't have any goals or dreams , he will be fail and pool .
I also have dreams , I will be oriental doctor , because in the chaina , some doctor revive a man by his oriental medicine .
I think it will have dreams to revive man .

Old people can enjoy their life , too .
But it is less than young people .
Young peopl can have many memories , healthy bodies , and friends .
Also they have lots of dreams .
So I think Young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
