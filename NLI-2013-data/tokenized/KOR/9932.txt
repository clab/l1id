People , espeally ordinary people , often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already khow how to do well .
I strongly believe that Most honored people like to do something new one .

Most of successful people are curious .
they always think about that which people are not intersted in. as people know , the chief of Sony company is the best example .
when he was young , he thought he listens to the radio not only staying at home , but only walking down street .
So , finally he made Sony walkman .
he became known person and successful person .

They also have a dream themselves and they do that what they try to do new things .
they were embitionce .
and if they decided somthing , they never give up .

Of course , all of them are not like that .
Some successful people like to do what they already know how to do well .
But others are not afraid to faced with new things .
Indeed , they could do that what they want .

Taking all of these things into account , successful people would like to try new things and take risks .
