In today 's world , successful people try new things while others doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree that successful people always try new things in other to succed .
because people need new information and important to get new things .

First of all , if people never try new things how can they succeed in their business .
one of my friend 's mother has her own food store she always try to find new information and think about how can increase customers more and more .
Even though she already knows how to do well and what to do well .
I think that is why she can keep her own business seccessfully .

Second , these days technology is amazing and increasing so that means people make a lot of new things and find new things .
Every countries are getting change in these days .
In my opinion , sucessful people always try to find what is the best way and good .
And then people can succeed perfectly .
Third , if people doing what they know how to do well , that is not enough and must be failed afterwards .
every one know how to do well .
However , it depends on how much people can try new things and make good in order to succed .
It does n't matter that how to do well .
My friends is also succed her own business when she tried to find new things .
This is the one of the good way if one does n't want to fail one business .

Threrfore , I totally agree Successful people always try new things .
then they will succeed .
