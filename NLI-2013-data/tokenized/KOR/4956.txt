I agree with the concept that most advertisements make products seem much better because I experienced the same event .
Being a consumer , I meet first with the new products in magazine or TV advertisement .
If I get attracted to the advertisement , I wish to buy the product .
Thus , most advertisements exaggerate the good side of the product because the producers want the world to buy them .

For example , most advertisements do not mention the side effects of drugs even though they can be pretty detrimental .
One consumes drugs frequently whenever faced with illness .
Even though it is bad to take the loads of them , one takes it over and over again until the disease is gone .
I am not sure about American advertisement , but in my home advertisement , there is no mention about side effects of the drug .
There is not much chance that side effect will appear even 10 percent but I believe it is better to warn the cosumers with those beforehand .
The producers do not mention about the side effects because they want their product to be sold .
I believe this applies to any other products .
Thus , advertisment represent the product to be better than the real quality .

For another example , advertisements do not show how long clothes or the whiteness of teeth last for .
Two years ago , I bought a box of `` White Strip '' .
I did not pay attention to the lasting quality because the advertisement did not mention any of that sort .
I tried them for a month and my teeth sure did get whiter but that was a temporary effect .
After a month , my teeth were same as before if not worse .
From that time on , I never buy those products again .
Consequently , the advertisement did not mention that the effect lasts temporarily because they want consumers to buy the product .

Another example would be diet coke .
Advertisement say that diet coke has less calories than the original one .
If one has ever drank diet coke , she will notice that it is sweeter than the real one since diet coke use artificial sweetner .
According to the research , artificial sweetner has no calorie but is more harmful than the real sugar if consumed in large quantities .
Nevertheless , the advertisement does not mention anything about those information .
It is sel-evident that the advertisement gives the false impression .

In conclusion , advertisements are not to be believed completely because they omit the bad effects or disadvantages of the products .
Consumers buy the products if they are attracted by the advertisements and that is producer 's trick : representing the better quality of the product to allure the consumers .
