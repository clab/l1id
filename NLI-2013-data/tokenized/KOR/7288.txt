I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
I liked to travel .
And I went to many country .
Japan , Nepal , China , Kenay , Pilipin And Tywan .
I went to Japan two time ..
First time , I went that together my friends 10 years ago .
Of course , we had a tour guide ..
Guide was man and very hansome .
He was very nice and Kind .
He saied to us about Japan .
( history , food ... )
5 years ago , I went Japan because my best friends lives that .
But my friend do n't know that interestong 's plase and restrant musiem ..
Her thought very simple ..
Also , we make trip 's plan very hard .
I think , live and travel different !

To summarize , enjoy and happy 's travel need to guide .
