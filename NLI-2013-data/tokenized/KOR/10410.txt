There are so many successful people In my country .
they won the risk of situation .
In my opinion , Successful people try new things and they might be success .
they always reserch new things and made a lot of money .

The korea has some international company .
Samsung , LG , Hyundai , Kia , Fila ..
etc .
They tried new things and took risks .
For example .
Samsung had to choose future industry between memory chips and air plane industry .
and finally when they choose the memory industry , Almost people worried about that .
because the Samsung did not have any other know-how and information .
But now Samsung is very famous for memory .
and electronic hardwares .

But the successful people can not always win the risk .
Sometimes They got in troble financial problem .
even their company can not stand anywhere .
For example , The samsung owner Lee , Kwun-hee like cars so much .
He is famous for car mania .
So , He decided to make a Samsung car company .
Before he made a his company , There were three big car campanys in korea .
Kia , Hyundai , and Daewoo .
So he could not win this game .
but he made a car company .
The company lose the their game .
and the effect was suffer from the samsung 's owner .

I know some example like this situation .
The successful people or nomal people can try new things and wln their risks .
but no always
