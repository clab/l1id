As the social grows fast , there are many kinds of social aspects appear .
Nowadays , young people are likely to work for their society without thinking their own duty .
I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
First , they cannot receive their minimum wages or not return their money completely .
Teenagers , they are still young to have their own job and they do not have the ability to perform their working .
There are many employers who hire premature students and they use their students employees like a servants .
Students try to do their work best .
However , when the time they receive their money , employers do not give them any money and they postpone student 's minimum wages .
ability Second , young people like teenagers are likely to less sleeping so their health conditions becoming really terrible .
Young people have to sleep enough time because their time is the most important period in their whole lives .
They need to rest and regulate their health condition .
However , if they go out and work , it causes many health problems so they do not sleep well at night and exposed many different kinds of disease .

Third , they cannot do their own duties , so they can not adapt their on going life .
Teenagers have to do their own tasks and make things accomplished .
They feel frustrated when they do not have their own work if they throw away their duties and participate their community works .
They feel very hard to adjust their lives between their daily life and a lot of community works .
Thus they become losers .

To conclude , students are the most beautiful when they feel glad about their duties and continue to march for their dreams .
When they become adults , they can do their job anytime they want to do .
