I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In three reason , it can be proved , exazageration , repeating , and useing famous person .
First of all , exageration is good evidence .
Some company can not lie about the its production .
However , they usually use other factors in advertisements .
For example , there are many heathy people and they always smile in the madicine advertisements .
Even though people usually get a medicine when they sick , the advertisements always shsw healthy and happy people .
The consumer might think that they could be healthy if they get the medicine .
But , it is wrong .
This is exageration of advertisements .

Second , many company usually use famous person for advertisements .
If a famous person says '' This is good product .
And I am useing this product everyday. '' , people believe it .
People believe it because they are famous person .
But , usually the product is not concerned with the famous person .
People think that they can be nice if they use it .
But it is wrong because it is just advertisement .

Third , repeating is one of methods many company can use in their advertisements .
When people hear a prase again and again , usually people remember the word and praise .
It is not necessory to say that they will buy the product when they see it .
For example , my wife and I usually go to shopping together .
When we see the same product which we saw in advertisement , we usually buy it .
Because the product is only one thing that we have a information about it .
Even thouth it is just the product 's name or praise it often make an important roll in my decision .

In conclusion , I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because many company use exazageration , a famous person , and repeating , people buy the product .
