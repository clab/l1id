I do n't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There can be various types of travel .
I think the best way to travel is to go around alone and to operate the travel schedule for oneself .

First , we should choose travel whether to go alone or to e in group by its purpose of travel .
When we research a policy , visit official agencies and participate international exchange program or conference , to travel in a group is more effective .
But , when we travel for refreshment and leisure , we had better travel alone .

Second , traveling in group by a tour guide prohibits from choosing the time and place to go .
People in a group have a different preference to the time and place to visit and knowledge about history and background about the tour course .
Though a tour guide makes schedule , it dose n't reflect everyone 's need and want .
For example , when I have been to Great Britain in a group by a tour guide , I had very few time to visit British Museum and much time to go about many parks .
Though I want to have some more time in musium , I just could 2 parts of the musium .

Finally , traveling in a group by a tour guide never can give the meaning of travel itself .
I want to travel not only for visiting new places , but also for meeting myself and people living in other people .
When traveling in a group , I have liitle time to see and meet myself and other people and have to follow fast my group and time schedule .
So when I had a research trip in a group to Japan , I asked to have free time for 3 hours and visited the university campus where my passed grandfather had graduated .
It gave a chance to meet Japanese people and myfamily and myself .

Travel alone give
