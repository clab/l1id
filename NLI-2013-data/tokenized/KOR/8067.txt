I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is more important then to learn facts .
This is because it helps the students to understand the material better .
Also , it builds up the ability for the students to think .
In addition , it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinion .

Firstly , it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps the students to understand the material better .
For example math is the subject that does not involve much concept .
One has to accept the facts and apply it to other mathematical equation .
Although the teacher teaches individual the proof of the math theory , it does n't help much to understand the concept of it .
One has to accept the fact and practice that fact so that it becomes easier to apply it to the equation .
Therefore it is harder to understand the material .
On The other hand in biology class learn the facts and do several lab experiments to understand the idea and the concept .
In biology class it is easier to understand the material since it shows the procedure of where and how the facts relate to the facts .
It is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps one to understand the material better .

Secondly , it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps the students to build up the ability for the students to think .
For example english class , I simply memorise the answer to the questions , therefore I do not get to think how it is the answer to the questions .
My thoughts on that material is limited .
On the other hand in psychology class it shows the procedure and concept of a particular study , I get to think how much the results of the study is valid and if there is an ethical considerations for it .
By understanding the concepts and ideas it helps the students to build up on their ability to think .

Thirdly , it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinion .
For example simply memorizing the facts does not help much for one to raise their own opinion , since one does not know the concept or the idea how the specific material became a fact .
When one understands the concept and the idea of an specific material , the individual would have their own thoughts about the specific material , since we are not a robot and have own opinions .
Therefore the students will not hesitate of addressing their own opinion because they can back their opinions with various reasons since they understand the ideas and concepts .

As a conclusion , I think it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because it helps the students to understand the material better .
Also , it builds up the ability for the students to think .
Moreover , it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinions .
