It is often said that knowing a variety of subjects is better than concentrating only one subject .
Some people might disagree with this statement because they believe that specializing one major can help them to be more successful .
However , I strongly support the idea in the statement since having a lot of knowledge is very useful in one 's life as well as helps students to study better .

To begin with , studying many subjects is very useful .
It is no secret that we live in a complex society that is consisted of many aspects .
Therefore , you can use your broad knowledge during your life .
A shining example of this is one 's hobby ; Even though your major is business , for instance , you would probably enjoy your hobby such as listening to music , going to the gallary , etc .
If you have a broadened knowledge about these things by taking a music or art class , it will be helpful to you when you enjoy them .
Therefore , it is obvious that various subjects can be used many times .

It is also true that many subjects have something to do with each other .
It is especially true because there is no independent subject in the world .
In other words , all subjects are linked together .
Here is what I have seen myself .
My major is languge .
However , I am taking not only classes that are my major but also one physiology class .
In my major class , I study about human 's brain that is related to ability to speak .
Also , in the physiology class , I learn about haman 's brain , too .
This is an evidence that language and physiology are related subjects .
Given this , a lot of subjects can help one to study one 's major better .

In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is more important to have a variety of information in many subjects than only one major .
That is because it is useful as well as improves your study .
Therefore , if I can , I want to study more kinds of subjects in the future .
