I had a trip to Che-ju island in my country , Korea , with my friends , and it was a trip that led by a tour guide .
After the journey , there were more bad memories than good ones , because of these reasons ; caanot choosing visit places , and the problem of extra fees .
For my experiences , I disagree with the opinion that the tour group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .

First of all , People robbed their rights to choosing the spots to visit , If the travel team is organezed and led by a tour guide , people of the the team have to follow the schedule which is made by the guide .
For example , I could n't visit the museum which exhibit the numerous kinds of unique plants grown only in Han-ra mountain in Che-ju island .
Instead of that , we merely followed the typical travel courses like teddy bear museum , and restaurants that sells black pig .
How waste of time !!
I can see such a thing not only in the island , but in my town .
To follow the schedule we had to sacrifice our right to decide where to go .

In addition , going travel with a guide is too costly .
There are many so called ` options ' that we can choose whether we will experience it or not .
However , in reality , the ` options ' are not option as it means literally .
The guide makes people to do , or sometimes buy something madatorilly .
and of coures it is not conclued in the travel fee people already paid .
To illustrate this , a TV program in Korea revealed the reality of the ` option ' system .
They research about that , and conducted a survey to the people who experience the guide tour .
Most of them did n't wanted to do the program , but compelled to do that by the reason that if someone does n't participate alon , then he or she will break the harmony of the team .
Furthermore , about 90 % of them disappointed to the cost , and quality of the optional programs they had experienced .
It shows how expensive to tour with a guide .

In conclusion , I disagree with the view that the tour with guide is the best way of travel , because we cannot go where we wish to go , and have to pay for the extra fees for optional program , As for me who experienced such a bad-memoried-trip , I am planning to go Euroup next summer with my own preparation , and organization .
Even though It is hard to prepare , it will bestow me happier memories , and allows me to save money .
