It is hard to say that which one is better .
But if I were given a chance to choose one of them , I would rather to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because understanding ideas and concepts are more beneficial than learning facts .

Let 's shed some light on the disadvantage of learning facts .
It can be misleading information only if the fact is an exception of the ideas and concepts .
For example , let 's assume that some frogs are dark brown but most frogs are green .
If a child looks at the dark brown frog , he of she might consider all frogs as dark brown frogs .
As this example , wrong information may be worse than not knowing .
Also , it has small advantage which is that people learn more vividly .

On the other hand , to understand ideas and concepts helps people understand facts more .
If someone has no idea about specific idea and concept , he or she might not be able to catch that which ideas of concepts belong to the fact .
Unlikely , if I understood some ideas and concepts , I could handle the fact better .
From my experience , when I was on camping , I needed a fire .
I realized that I forgot to bring a liter .
Then , I could make a fire easily with glasses because I understood the concept of light reflection .
It was very useful .
I was proud myself .

As all is concerned , I prefer to understand ideas and concepts .
In my opinion its advantage always overweigh the advantage of to learn facts .
