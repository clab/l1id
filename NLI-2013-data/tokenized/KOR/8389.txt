I agree to the statement .
There are many steps on developing students ' cognitive capacity .
Students are learning from imitating their parents and teachers .
And they are learning the facts by taking lessons from them .
Leaning facts is very important .
Students learn from historical facts and scientific facts .
Those facts that they have learned may stimulate the students ' cognitive capacity and interest .
But when they learn only facts without understanding ideas and concepts they just memorize and simply accumuklate them to their knowledge .

`` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
When students understand ideas and cncepts it is harder for them to forget the facts than they just learn facts .
When students understand ideas and concepts , they can learn why the facts come to exist and how to develop from the facts to the further levels of knowledge .
There are basic ideas and concepts underlying the facts .
Students should know them to connect the facts that are related to .

Knowledge is accumulation of facts .
But students need to apply the facts that they have learned into thier real lives .
To apply the facts that they have learned into their lives they must understand ideas and concepts underlying the facts .
When they understand ideas and concepts they can develop more from what they have learned .
Further inquiry based on the facts that they have learned with ideas and concepts will stimulate their academic interest and help them advance their learning and achievement .

Understanding ideas and concepts also help students to organize what they have leraned and how to relate to one another in their cognitive organization .
Later on they can deliver and teach what they have learned to anohte students or their students who want to know more about the facts .
Teaching ideas and concepts to their friends and students will help them learn more easily from them .

Therefore understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learing facts .
