Is it the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ?
Some people might say yes to the subject .
However , it is my view that it is not the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
In other words , people cannot fullfil their desires and needs during the journey if they were in a group led by a tour guide .
The examples of Leonardo Da Vinci , thugs ( or horse-riding buglars ) in rural areas of China , and Herman Merville validate my statement .

When people talk or read an article about the graceful and glorious days of Renassiance , people soon encounter a familiar name called Leonorado Da Vinci .
Leonardo Da Vinci has renowned from those days of Renassiance for his ginuine intellectual accomplishments over the various subjects : Art , Sciensce , herbalogy , anatomy and so forth .
However , not many people are aware of Leonardo Da Vinci as a travler .
Da Vinci made all his trips alone ( or with a servant at his service ) through out the European Continent as one of his favorite activity when there was a demand for his cunning hands at various subjects .
Da vinci also took a lot of shor-trip to fullfil his desire for more knowledge and observation which meets his interests .
Da Vinci was the man who knows the taste of traveling alone .

It is not very common ( or well-known ) fact that there is still horse-riding buglars in rural areas of China .
And people feel more arkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going on as a current event .
What does this do with the wellness of the people who frequently goes to China traveling alone ?
Nothing pretty much unless you are a ever-wonderer who always seeks the scarcely inhabited lands .
Moreover , these buglars are mostly caught for the safetly of lonely travelers who even wants to travel undeveloped lands of China .

There is a great guest from Literature , Herman Merville when you talk about the one who seeked out the wilderness of nature .
Herman Merville made such great deeds on his work of The Whale ( Or The Moby Dick ) after whaling although he travled not alone and rather accompanied and guided with experienced ones toward whaling .
However , whaling or sailing has been always the subject of great travlers whether they like to travle alone or not they accompanied and guided with more experienced ones since there has been always no choice since traveling on the seas has to have a group work ( in most terms ) unless you are a lonely sailor with a small boat which goes not far away from ashore .
Herman Merville would have not been recalled as a great writer if he had not been a great sailor as he has been renowned .

All the instances from Art , History and Current-events validate my statement .
It is always the best to travel lonely .
