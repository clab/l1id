I agree with that successful people always try new things to do and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
As we can see them , most of the them are very advantureous people this fact makes they are very special , and successful people .

Successful people likes adventure .
One of the famous inventor Eddison likes advernture .
He always tried to get new things that other people do n't know yet .
Before he invented the light ( electricity ) , he has thousand times of lab for invent the light , evne his lab room was burned down , he never forgive up and enjoy the advent

They has a unique think that is we ca n't even imagine that .
Eddison was kind of unique child when he was young .
He thought the eggs are hetching if he makes them warm so he hugged the eggs for a while .
This story is very famous story about his childhood .
as we can see , he was not a normal child and does n't have a normal thinking likes other children .
That kind of unique thinking makes a person going to be different than others .
