I think travel with friend and without tour guide is the best .
true happiness and knowledge came from horrable experience .
if tour guide are together with you , there are any ploblems .
how and you get the worth of effort on that conditions ?

travel With friend means it 's better than the alone .
of course there are many benefits in travel alone , but the pleasure is less than the two .
I think to have pleasure and happiness also important in traveling .

2 years ago , I went to philipines with only my best friend for almost one year .
that gives me strong self-confidence , relationships , and lots of experiences .
through the terrible mistakes , I had many bad suffer .
but that gaves me amazing social abilities .

of course , travel with tour guide can give us specific information .
but it is less important than the lots of benfits which is get by oneself .
and that is more useful to live in .

in korea , many people travel alone or with friend before the graduate from university .
so called bagpack-travel .

in my opinion , the best way to travel is with your best friend .
