I am not young people , but I was .
When I was a young boy , I believe there is no higher principle of helping people .
But I have read the article at the newspaper which is young people nowadays not to try their time to spend helping other people .

I think this is caused because of 2 reasons .
The first , it is bacuse of the development of indusry .
as Industry developing .
We are more care about the study of technic and scicene than subject of moral activity .
In the scool , the student and some of the teacher are focusing only on their classroom to go the University .
They do n't want to teach and study human ' basic moral Value any more .

Second , the western culture made our yound people selfish .
Traditionally , Korean peoples are kind and like to help each other .
but after the 20th century , western culture inported to Korea so fast and widely .
that makes our young people changed i believe .
