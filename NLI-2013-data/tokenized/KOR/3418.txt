Some people have an idea that young people have a lot of time to give hands to their communities .
However , others think that youngers , these days , do not have enough time to accomodating the communities they are living .
In my opinion , to young people , time is lack to helping their communites becasue of their educating and more options for spending their free time .

To begin with , nowadays , many parents believe that education is the most important point to their children .
Therefore , they make their children concentrate on only studying .
To be specific , my sister who is high school student spend a lot of time on studying .
After finishing her class in the school , she go to the English and science institution .
When she come back to the home , it is always about 11 a'clock in the night .
As a result , if many younges want to contribute to their communites , they do not have time to care about the helping the communites .

In additon , aroud the young peole , there are many attrative options to spend their time except studying .
These attractive places interrupt to helping the communities .
In my city , there are many theaters and amusement parks .
Also , by developing the Internet , young people often play games and chat with friends in the online .
For example , my cousin who is 17 yeas old thinks that playing on line game is only a resort to spend his free time , He told to me playing the game is more intersesting than helping his community .

In brief , I firmly beleive that now , young peole do not use their time to working at their communites , because their parents let them focus on only their studies .
As a result , they are extreamly busy .
Also , if they have a little time , youngers do other things like going to the theaters or other places and playing on line game rather than sharing work for their communities .
If you are a busy student because of your study , which one will you choose between going to theater to watch exciting movies and working for your community ?
