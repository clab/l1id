How many times do you see advertisements a day ?
Recently we live in the flood of advertisements and it is true that sometimes they can be very useful information to buy something new .
However , it is not good to trust every fact which is in the advertisement .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Showing their product seem better than they really are can be considered as a marketing strategy .
There are too many products which have the same function in the world , and if they want to sell their products , they need to make the advertisement of their product which has the same function but has to seem much better than other products .
The problem is from that point .
They decide to lie in order to sell their product more and the customers who buy that product wil be cheated .

I had an experience to buy a set of equipments for cooking .
In the television advertisement , it looked like magic .
Show-hosts could to everything with those eqipments easily and it worked very well on tv .
And also the product was much cheapper than other products which were selled in real shops .
However , I could not do anything well with the same equipments .
The knives which had special purposes were worse than a knife which I had used before them , and I could use several types of pots and pans only for two or three months .
And then , I had to buy new equipments .

Even though it is true that advertisements are necessary to show someone 's products widely and easily , there should be only truth in the advertisements .
