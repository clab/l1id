Some people agree that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts or others disagree that .
When I read this question , I vicillated between agree or disgaree because both are important to students .
However , I agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it if for them to lern facts .
There are few specific reason and examples to support my statement .

First , ideas and concepts could be basic information of all theory or others .
For example , facts are from the ideas and concepts .
If there are not ideas and concept , ther also are not the facts , all investigations have patterns or method such a scientific method .
First of all we think ideas and concepts first .
That is why I assert that all facts made by lots of ideas and concepts .

Second , People can nat critical thinking when they learn facts .
For example , 1 + 1 = 2 is a absolutely facts but they would not know why 1 + 2 = 2 because they do not know the comcept of the fomular .
Students to understand is ideas and concepts that will be helpful to them .

In conclusion , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts .
