There are many people understand ideas and concepts but they do n't know what they are .
The student have to do what they are from doing To learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts for students .
Here are some reasons to support my idea .

First of all , There is a soccer ball .
Everyone knows what to do with the ball .
If there is two people that person Awho has naver played soccer ; however knows the soccer ball very well , and person B has experiences to play soccer but , he does n't really know about the ball .
Person B knows about a soccer ball because he has learned facts to play .
Person A knows about the ball ; however , he does n't know how to play because he only has ideas .

Second of all , there is a blind , and he understand to play soccer .
However , he has never seen it and played .
The blind has ideas ; however , the ideas is not worth because he has naver done .
To do what he thinks will make the blind to learn playing soccer .

Third of all , there are students in the classroom and a professor is giving a lecture .
The professor makes students understand ideas and concepts ; however , the students do n't know what they are because of no experiences from the ideas .

Finally , there is a Korean adverb which is `` To do once is better than to listen to ideas . ''
According to the adverb , even if a person had ideas , there would be nothing before doing things .
Therefore , he will learn what the ideas are .

In conclusion , I believe that to learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts .
I 'm writing an essey with learning facts .
If I only understood the ideas of writing , I would never write anything .
