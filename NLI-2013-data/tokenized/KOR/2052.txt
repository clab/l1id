I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and there are three main reasons why I think so .
First of all , there are more tasks given to young people than to old people .
For example , young people have to study in order to go to school and get a good mark at class .
They also have to work to make money or to be experienced enough to get a better job .
Sometimes they are too busy to do something they really want .
But older people have done all the tasks given to them .
All they have to do is to receive a reward and appreciation for their hard work and achievement .

Secondly , old people are wise enough to realize what pleases them .
In other words , they enjoy their lives whereas young people often get stressed out from living .
Old people have more experiences and clues about what life and they know how to behave when they face a challenge .
Probably the reason why young people think they are struggling through their lives is that they have less experiences than older people and panic whenver they find their lives difficult .
Old people know how to enjoy their lives , hoping young people will soon realize what they figured out when they were young .

Thirdly , and more importantly maybe , old people are richier than young people .
They have worked hard and have earned money as a result .
They can spend money on whatever they want .
They can buy a fancy car , they can make a beautiful garden , and they can even give their money to their children if they want to .

Everyone wants to enjoy life and the only difference is the ways of enjoying life .
People cannot assume that old people cannot enjoy life only because they are old and boring .
Obviously , there are many things for young people to learn from older people .
They need to learn how to work hard , how to achieve their goals , and how to enjoy life .
However , most of these questions will be answered completely as they actually get aged .
