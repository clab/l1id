In our scientifically advanced world , mass media have become a major part of people 's lives .
We consume most of our information from medias like television , radio , internet and newspaper .
They all have informations for people to learn , but they also have advertisements as a part of their income .
Therefore , the advertisements on the mass medias have come into people 's lives a lot .
Although the adverisements should provide accurate descriptions of its products , they often exaggerate the positive characteristics , hiding the negative part , and suggests unrealistic possibilities to convice the customers .

On television , every channel has periods between programs to show the commercials .
I watch most of the car commercials very carefully , because I 'm interested in automobiles .
What I observe from the advertisements are the biased display of facts about the cars .
For example , a car with very low horsepower and torque is shown only the good characteristics such as fuel efficiency .
There is no way for the customer to find out how small and weak the engine is from the commercial .
Also the car company often increase the fuel efficiency by not giving the average , but the maximum value they got from their experiments , which is an inaccurate information for the customers .
Advertisments make the products look better by only giving selected and biased information .

Another example is advertisements lik the Nike commmercials .
The sports equipment brands like Nike hires famous sports stars in their advertisements to connect the performance with their product .
They show great actions of sports stars like Andre Agassi and show their products saying the their great performances are derived from the use of their products .
It convinces the viewers that the products can also increase their performance as much as the sports stars ' .
These kinds of suggestions fabricates the product as a much better good than it really is .

In conclusion , advertisements are a method for the producers to sell more of their goods .
Therefore it is obvious for the produicers to make their products good better in order to increase the demand .
The car advertisements with selected and bias information make the customers believe the product is a better car until they find out the negative characteristics on their own .
Also the Nike commercials with sports stars convince the viewers that the product is good enough to help them become like the stars , which is highly unlikely .
I do n't believe making the products look better is neccessarily bad unless they present true information , because it is the whole point of advertisement and competition between brands to earn more money .
