I strongly disagree with the best way to travel with tour guide .
When I was a kid , I went to sighting with my parents , relatives , and tour guide .
It was the worst experience which I have ever had .
Here are several reasons why traveling led by guide is so bad .

In begin with , traveling with guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start .
It cannot give you a free time .
Not only that , but you cannot afford to break even though you cannot buy only one present for your friends .
I think that one of the purposes which have a tour is relax without busy life .
If you go with guide , you will not get any fresh air .

Second , traveling in a group makes people angry .
It can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested , others have a desire to move another places because they do not need to observe anymore .
In this case , they have to decide what they will do .
But any group in this situation would be disappointed .

Finally , there is a famous maxim - If you travel alone , you are not alone .
It means that going trip alone allows you make frineds .
For instance , I went to Japan when I was a freshman in the university .
I had a traveling for a month .
I cannot speak Japanese fluently In that tour , I can make friends - Nakasaki , Murama , and Yorisimo .
It was an unfogettable experience .
When you are with your fellows , you cannot have chances to have new foreign friends .

As I mentioned above , I do n't like traveling in a group led by guide .
Fixed tour planning makes me exhausetd .
Group tour makes persons dissatisfied .
And if you can go somewhere alone , you can get friends .
On the contrary , if you are very old , you can like a group tour with a guide .
It makes sense that if you are satisfied with that , you are too old to feel free .
