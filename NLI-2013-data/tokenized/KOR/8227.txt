I agree that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
There are some reasons that student should learn and understand ideas and concept before the learn facts and that they need to have solid mental background as base .
First , learning facts without understanding ideas and concept is same as making a sand castle .
For example , if they use a machine or instument for any reason without knowing the mechanism or concept , they can copy some work but they ca n't make creative work .
Or when they encounter some problems , they ca n't solve anything and have to depend on other people who know the mechanism .
Second , they wo n't be creative .
They do n't need to start from scratch for everything .
However , once they know some concepts , they can manuplate and apply many things as they want and develope the current stage of work or improve to make it productive .
The third reason is a making a good habit when they learn ideas and concepts .
People who like to learn facts usually are lazy or superficial .
Once people learn facts first , they do n't want to learn ideas or concept because learning basic needs a lot of time and effort until they get the final product .
They do n't want to spend their time and energy for learning invisible things .
They want just product without efforts .

Students mean who are learning new things and developing their ability for their future or for societies they are belonged to .
Therefore , I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , especially when they are young .
