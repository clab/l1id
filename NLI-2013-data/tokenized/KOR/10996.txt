Many people who success these days , have underwent many different experiences .
Espeacially , the ones who are introduced in the news or the internet , is speacial from others .
So , I agree with the Statement , ` Successful people try new things ' because they have courage that they would succeed in trying a new task , and try to develop the present .

To begin with , the people who have succeeded in their life try new things , since they have a faith in their heart that makes them succeed in a certain part .
If they did not have such courage , the successed people would not even have had a chance to change their lives .
For example , I have an uncle , who is a mountain climber .
Since he was in college , my grandmother tried to make him give up his dream , which was being a mountain climber .
Since it is not that of a famous job , my grandmother tried everything to stop him , even acted if she was ill to make him abdicate in that job .
However , my uncle did not give up , and practiced very hard and became a successful mountain climber who teaches students and helps them win contests .

Moreover , since trying to develop what we have now makes people successful , people should have the chance to try new things .
Making what other could not think of is a huge step up .
For instance , if Bill Gates did not try to invent Microsoft , the society would not have been developed this much .
His attempt to develop the human lives also made him repectful and succeed in his life .
I think that his courage for such an attempt , which made him through all the way to being a the inventor and the richest people in the world , was the key for his success .

To conclude , having risks or trying new tasks is the way to be successful because that person had the courage enough to make it trough .
Also , since the people who succeed had the mind to make a better world , people should try new things .
People should try anything to make oneself succeed in their goals .
