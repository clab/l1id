Most people are afraid to take risks or learn new things because they guess that it might fail .
However , I believe that try new things and taking risks is what makes a person a successful person .

It is good to have one thing that a person can do well .
However , when he or she learns about a new thing , they can relate what they have learned to what they already know .
In my school , our civics class do the chart called KWL chart .
It 's a chart listing what I already know , what I want to know , and what I have learned , which we filll out after the lesson .
When I take the lesson with a basic knowledge that I already know to learn a new thing , I can relate them afterwards and also , infer factors about the topic .
When someone only sticks to something that they know and how to do it , they will not succeed in society since they do not have broader knowledge than other people in the community .

I strongly believe that taking risks is a best way to succeed .
When people take risks and fail , they can fix what they 've done wrong , and get it right next time .
For example , Thomas Alva Edison had failed alot of times when inventing his light bulb , however , if kept on trying and finally made a light bulb that changed out lives .
If he had stick to the job as a railroad worker and not put his job on risk for what he wants to do , he would n't be called `` the wizard of the Menlo Park . ''

Taking risks can also being sure of what someone is doing .
If someone made decision , he or she should be proud of it and stick to it .
For example , the famous chairman of the Microsoft Bill Gates dropped out of college to start a new world that he wanted .
He did not drop out because he could not follow the courses , but he dropped out because he was sure that he could make this world different .
And by sticking to the decision he made and working hard to achieve his goal , he became successful and got what he wanted to get .
Even though he had the risk of not getting a successful job if he failed , but he came out successful because he stick to the decision he made .
if he just stayed in school like a normal student , our life would n't been very modernized as today .

Being successful is what moast people in the world aim for .
However , i believe that trying new things and taking risks makes a person successful such as Bill Gates and Thomas Edison rather than just doing only one thing that they are good at .
