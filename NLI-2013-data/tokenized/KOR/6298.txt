I can say I agree with this topic but I also can say I do not agree with this topic .
I 'm not sure about the point of part of it says `` cars in use '' .
Car is one of the most familiar goods that we need in day life .
we also can use bus or subway even the air plane but we always need a car when you try to go somewhere , even with your family .
And poeple actually thinks they needs a car for some reason .
this causes horrible traffic on the road all the time also with bad gases from the car It destroies enviroment these days .
We always want more comfortable life style with better quality that we could have .
Now days car is pretty much affordable goods .
Even though there are alot of expensive cars .
But I 'm pretty sure about the number of a car for each person who has the car would never get discrease but not everybody would drive their car everyday .
It is already enough that we going through right now with horrible traffic and bad Air .
I do n't have my own car yet but I see my parents , They have their own car but they do n't go out driving with their car all the time .
Sometimes subway is much faster than driving a car without being tired .
Basicially what I 'm saying is , the number of cars in use would never be discreased but It does n't mean that traffic would get worse than this or everybody would n't drive their car and only start using a bus or subway .
About the bad gases from cars , alot of Technicsions are working on making non-gas cars .
For example the car could run with sunshine or even water etc .
Actually I heard some one made that kind of cars already but It 's not that common for everybody .
I 'm sure There will be alot of poeple who would drive that kind of car .
But I also hope we make better situation to use a bus or subway for going everywhere .
That would reduce the number of cars in use for sure .
