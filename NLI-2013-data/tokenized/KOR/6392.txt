Some people believe that there would be fewer cars in use in the near future than today .
I personally think that there would be more cars in use than these days .
First of all , people are looking for alternative fuel resources that would replace the petroleums , which is the major fuel source for cars .
Secondly , there would be better access to places , meaning better roades for cars .
Lastly , many third countries are developing and that would lead to more people being able to use the cars .

First , these days , people are searching for alternative resources to petroleums .
People use petroleums for many uses but especially for the fuel of cars .
When people are looking for another fuel source for cars that would mean they would keeping on using the cars in the future .
This shows that people would n't stop using the cars even in the future , meaning the number of cars in use would n't decrease in twenty years .

Second , the world is getting smaller , meaning access to places around the world is getting better .
So many people are not able to travel around the world since flight ticket prices to other countries are extremely expensive .
Since people are trying to let people move around easily , the roads for cars would be developed and built to many places to the other countries in the world .
There are many people who are willing to visit foreign countries , and in the near future there would be better roads for the cars .
That would lead to increase in demands for cars .

Finally , the third and developing countries are rapidly growing .
For example , China is growing to become one of the strongest countries in the world .
Many people in China do n't have cars due to the poverty they are going through , but the country , China , is growing by days and nights and is suprising so many other countries around the world .
In the near future , more Chinese would have and use cars to move around and China has the biggest population in the world .
China is not the only developing country which would become a strong country soon .
There are a lot of countries that are in similar situation like China .

To conclude , the demand for cars and the use of cars would n't decrease in the near future , but increase instead .
There are people who searching for alternative fuel source for cars .
There would be better roads and better access to so many places in the world .
Lastly , there would be more people who could afford cars from many developing countries .
Therefore , it would be impossible for the number of cars in use to go down in twenty years .
