Nowadays many people dream to be a ` succesful person ' in his or her society .
In my oppinion those succesful people try to express something they already know well rather than try new things .
That is why I disagree with the statement saying ` succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '
Most of success comes from doing something you already know such as drilling oil , developing upon something somebody already made , and having comfortable family .

Idea of drilling oil and selling them existed since the industrial revolution in England .
However , people drilling oil are still one of the richest people in the world .
My friend Sanjar 's dad was just a high ranked government officer in small country called Uzbekistan .
When his dad started to own a oil drilling business .
Now his dad drives Mercedes , owns summer house in 4 different countries , and gives his some 100 dallars a day .

Another example of getting rich without trying the new thing is developing upon something someone already acomplished .
In this way you can just pick up an idea of someone else , modify it and sell them .
For instance , Ipod , one of the most famous mp3 player brand just copied off an idea of one South Korean company .
All they did was add bigger memory and create new attractive design .

Last exmaple of being succesful people is people with happy family .
Creating happy family and managing well existed for centuries .
Yet they are not admired by some people it is very hard to acomphish and it is very pleasant to acomplish .
I can say people like my dad have very succeful life since he never divorced or never have kids that smoke or drink .

Eventough , who is succesful or not can be differ from person to person .
I believe most people who have succesful life are people who held on to their knowledge and skills they have rather than try whole new idea .
