People are constantly exposed to the facts being broadcasted through means of books , media , or the internet , but it is more important for the people to undertand the ideas and the concepts behind those facts than just learning about them .
A person might know a fact , but if she does not understand why such thing is happening , such a fact would not do any good to her .

Understanding is crucial , because it creates a huge impression on the minds of students while the facts impress them only when they hear about it .
In most high schools , the students in history class are exposed to facts .
However , it is their responsibility to go home and understand why such things happened in the past .
It makes logical connections between the events , which helps the student to remember the facts even after a long time has passed .
Moreover , the essay questions on exams for such cources tend to ask why an event has occured , asking Teachers would not be asking such questions on the exams were it not for the importance of them .

Understanding is important , because it is what brings changes .
When I was younger , I did not feel any need to study .
I was getting decent grades at school wihtout much effort , even though I was not the best .
Some told me that it might be a good idea for me to start studying , for it would make my future so much easier .
However , I never listened .
I knew that I would have to start studying someday , but did not believe it to be that moment .
I started to work harder at the school only after I understood the facts that were known to me all along .
I did not just know that I had to study , but I understood that if I do not , my life will be very different from the one I always dreamed of .
I could finally understood , only after I met some students in their last year of high school regretting over the things they have not done .
If it were not for the understanding part of my experience , I might still be a slacker .

Learning facts is less important , because they can be found everywhere .
The world we live in is now filled with information .
Therefore , we can look up the facts in seconds if we wanted to .
Understanding , however , cannot be found on the internet .
It is something that one needs to try to achieve .
Therefore , it is more valuable than mere facts .

Understanding is more important , because it allows us to apply the ideas on many fields .
It is possible to read a book a medical student might be required to read .
However , if one cannot understand what the book says , the information is useless to her .
It cannot be applied to anywhere else , and might be lost to her in seconds .

Since understanding brings changes , requires effort , and makes facts applicable , it is much more important than the learning facts .
Moreover , it will last help the facts to stay on one 's mind longer than learning without understanding .
