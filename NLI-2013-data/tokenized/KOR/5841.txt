I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Instead , I think the number of cars will increase .
There are two reasons of my opinion .

First , the cost of the fuel for cars will become low .
In these days , many scientists are studying about alternative energy sources .
There researches are largely supported by government and moreover , the automobile companies who are anxious to meet their customers ' demands .
What people want is clean and cheap energy .
and twenty years is long enough time to discover or invent the alternative energy .
If it is invented , people will not hesitate to change their car from high-cost , gasoline-using cars to alternative energy-using cars .
And gradually , the number of cars will increase .

Second , nowadays , people are becoming more self-centered .
I think internet and technology made this phenomenon by providing an enviornment that people can work , play and rest alone .
Human beings love to enjoy the individual values and riding their own car is the perfect condition to be alone .
Technology is progressing and after twenty years , public transportation may be incredibly faster than now .
However , taking a crowded subway or bus is not as comfortable as riding one 's own car .
It is hard to be ` me ' in such a crowded place .
People need to feel comfortable and act unique in their own spaces .
For example , in one 's own car , he can sing , dance , yarn , talk loudly on the phone , etc .
I think people will prefer buying their car and enjoy this kind of freedom .

To sum up , I do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are now in the future ( within twenty years ) , because of the possibility of lower cost of fuel and people 's tendency to enjoy their freedom .
