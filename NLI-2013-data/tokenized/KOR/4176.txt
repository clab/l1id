In my country in Korea , there are time to helping their communities in elementary , middel , highschool .
They have sixty hours a year , so they make them helping communities .
So they help their communities not one-self .
These system show that young people nowadays do not want and give enough time to helping their communities .

There are several reasons on this situation .
Frist , nowadays young peopel do not perticipate the importance of their community .
So they think one-self is the most importance .
The do not think of their communities , so they could not think of helping their communities .
This situation is cased by only one child custom .
Many parents do not want to have many childern , so many families have only one son or daughter .
This son or daughter cannot have their sisters or brother , they do their own .

In addition , these days young people have many thing to do .
For example , when my cousin who is in eleven years old finished the school , she goes to learn about piano , math , so on .
When she finished her schaduel , the time indicates the evening .
Otherwise , they cannot have enough time to do another things .

In brief , I firmly agree with nowadays young people have more time to helping their communities .
Young people need to thought of helping their communities , and we are not live alone .
We should know the importance of community .
Also , governments should young people keep this thought continue .
