It is better to specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowlege of academic subject .

First of all , human brain is limited there are cuntless of books and knowlege in the world that human being has achieved .
It 's surely impossible that one individual has all that knowlege .
Beside if we want to broaden our knowlege the depth of it would be shallow .

However , if we specialize in one subgect , still it woul be a lot to do , it woul be much easier than to have broad knowlege , and we can deepen it by study and all kinds of efforts .

Second , there'are lot 's of college graduators in the world .
However if they have same level of knowlege. , it would be not helpful for each other .
In society , we ca n't live with other 's help .
We need doctor 's in hosptal , but also nurses and pharmasist .
It is efficient and easier to divide the work than one person does the all the jobs .

Third , we need to relay our accomplishment to our next generations like our former generation did .
If our ancestors have n't acheive anything , there would be no civilization and industralizaion of present time .

The world is developing by the people who study in specific subject .
We call them specialist .
Without specialists the world is not going to be develonped any
