Understanding facts are more important than understanding concepts .
Some people said `` We have only some real facts and others are theory . ''
But I disagree about that because of make problem when we make standard , make confuse , and attitude .

When I was in high school in second grade they have problem in Korean SAT .
They make a question about universe .
But the fact is different from the answer because our text book is old one .
Some students complain about the question .
The goverment have to agree about that .
So they have to make two answer at one question .
Even it suppose to has one answer .
Our country usually think facts is more important than concepts .
But this kind of problem always happend when they make standardize test .

Make confuse is other important reason that I disagreement .
If school teach concepts more important than facts they have to make mistake when they teach their student .
They have to make some example for explain their concepts .
But Concepts is more important than facts they use wrong example but easy to explain that concepts .
Maby this problem make students dum .

If school teach concepts more than facts students atittude can go wrong way .
In every work or problem they just think about the problem 's concept .
If they get bad grade because they use wrong facts they always complain to teachers and schools about their grade .
They think they are right because they use right concepts .
Their facts are not important for them .

Learning concepts is useful for study ; because it 's one of the easy way to unerstanding problem .
And it 's work pretty well at socail work .
But in math and other important sceince subject it never work because it does n't need wrong facts for explain their concepts .
