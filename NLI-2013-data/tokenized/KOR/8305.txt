It is more important for students to understand ideas and conceptd than it is fot them to learn facts .
there are some reasons why it is more important than learning facts .
facts are just lecture .
Idea and conceps are lecture , too .
However , they are different .

To understand ideas and concept are effective an education system .
For example , when teacher is explaning about abortion , if students understant the concepts .
Why is it argument ? , and why it is legal or illegal .
Students know about cuasing and effect of abortion .
Also , they can understant alternative way between molar and reality .

they know just facts , they can remember just result of abotion .
they can not know why it is argument .
they know just it is good or bad .
For example , teacher explain mathmatic .
If studends know just facts , they can know just answer .
they can not improve their skill , and they do not know process .

To know abot main point is the most important part of education .
the answer is important , but the process is more important than answer .
