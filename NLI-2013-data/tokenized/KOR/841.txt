I firmly disagree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
I would say at any time that digging in one field of study as far as you can go is much better than poking others wasting time and effort .
The reasons for this are lack of in-depth knowledge and difficulty in being successful in career .
Perhaps , a famous saying in my country , ` When digging a well , dig only one , could give a fundamental idea about my opinion .
I will discuss my reasons in detail in the following passages .

First of all , having broad knowledge in many academic fields may seem wonderful from time to time but it would only result in lack of in-depth knoweldge in any of those fields .
For example , if you study biology for 4 years instead of physics for 2 and biology for 2 , you will get really deep knowledge in biology and even be able to plan your future academic life more easily .
Also , this might get you acknoledgement from others and raise a possibility that you will be awarded for it someday .

Secondly , for most people schools are supposed to help them to get advanced in their career .
Having broad knoweldge in many fields can seriously damage your future career plan .
Suppose you are being interviewed by excutives for a nice job .
They will certainly be looking for a person who would do well on the jobs assigned to them .
They will want some who know what they are really doing , not just someone with various , but useless knoweldge on different fields .
This also can seriously hamper your promotion in the organization , even if you get hired .
A person with speicialized knowledge has more chance to advace in the organization since they can really develop thier niches and know exactly where they stood and are going .

In conlcusion , specializing in one specific subject makes a person more realiable as well as knowlegeable .
Keeping integrity personally and professionally has always been repected by others and accepted to be better than having shallowness in a variety of fields .
Just looking at today 's academic environement , it is easy to know that people are heading more specialized direction than ever .
