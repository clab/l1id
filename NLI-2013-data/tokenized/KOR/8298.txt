It is early in the morning .
Sun shines showing us its beautiful , radiant bright .
Birds sing in melifluous sounds .
But somewhere in this village , you hear constantly yawning sounds of students in a class .
The teacher is filling the blackboard with stringent face .
The words which are filled with balck board is all about the history of ` the hundred year war ' over France and US .
Students fall asleep subtly .

That was a brief description of a class in Korea .
I was born in Korea , and raised in Korea , and educated in Kroea .
And now , in 2006 , I am here in United States of America as sixteen years girl to experience American education which i 've heard that is extremely different from the education that I 've used to have .

The first class I had in American high school was biology .
It was `` literally '' different .
I was shocked in pleasure .
The new learning about biology was a fresh catharsis for me .
I learnedabout the system of the cell .
Actually , I 've learned about it in Korea too .
but the difference between that same concept is this ; my Korean teacher taught me the `` fact '' and my American teacher taught me and helped me the process of understanding ideas and concepts .
She did not force me to memorize facts that I used to do in Korea .
Instead , she had a laboratory with me , Together , we made a model of Cell , and then that was definetely easy to understand .
Furthermore , she finded the real video from the internet and then show me how it works and what its principles are .

It 's been several months pasted since I learned about the system of the cell , however , I still clearly remember the video she showed me and each detailed structure we 've made .
No doubt I got a one hundred on that class .

Learning facts is short-living .
It will leave your head as soon as you learn other things .
You can not remember it unless you 've translated that facts into your own language and solidified to `` concepts '' .
It takes amount of time to pass the process of turn facts into ideas .
You should find the way to clarify and figure it out .
It might be burdensome .
But once you 've figure it out , and you can clarify yourself that you understand the ideas , then it would be a genuine knowledge not just facts .

I 'm so glad to have topic .
Actually I was a sort of suprised to face this topic which reminds me the experience this American education gave me .
I ca n't wait to learn ideas and concepts and then understand it .
I did n't know or experience the joy of learning when I was in Korea .
My eyes were always heavy and not active .
But in here , the eUnderstanding its genuine idea or concepts enable me to study with my volition , not by parents .
