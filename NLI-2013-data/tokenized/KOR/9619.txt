It is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Some people might agree with this statement because of the probability of innovation by trying new things .
However , I disagree with this statement in that knowing how to do well is as much important as trying new one , and doing familiar is more secure than taking risks .

First of all , doing what people already know is very important as much as trying new one .
People who do only what they already know how to do well often lead them to be an expert of their fields .
Because they do the same work repeatedily , they may know many useful information of the work .
For example , my uncle is an owner of a restaurant .
the restaurant had succeeded from his grandparents , and my uncle has workd there for his entire life , and he did n't try to do new things even though he felt bored with the work .
Now , his restaurant is very famous traditional restaurant in my city , Seoul , S.Korea .
He knows well the recipes of the menu , and sometimes teaches the skill to his workers .

In addition , when it comes to the safety of work , doing familiar things guarantees more stable life .
Some might say that many innovative inventions were from the trial new things and taking some risks .
However , the successes were very small parts of the trials .
Much more people have failed at those trials and risks .
Moreover , many successful professionals like doctors and lecturer have shown that their skillful work style was the key of their successes , but not just trying new and innovative things .
Their work is very safe as well .

In conclusion , it 's not bad to try new things and find other ways in their fields , but it is not the best way to succeed in their fields .
This is because the importance and safety of doing what they already know how to do well cannot be underestimated .
