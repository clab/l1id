`` The object of travel is not only seeing other scencery but also experience a lot of things . ''
This is my opinion about the travle .
Thus , I do not agree with the topic .
I will stated briefly the two reasons supporting my opinion .

First , the reason why it is better to travel without tour guide is that people can feel foreign people those who live in that country .
Actually , in my experience , I went to the UK with my freind few month ago for enjoing hollidays .
We just walked what we want to go , during going to other place , we needed to ask how to we get there to someone .
During this , I did talk many people , also I made a foreign freinds .
However , If peole in group with guide , there is no chance to meet and talk to foriegn people .

Second , the reason why it is better to travel without tour guide is that if there is any limit to travel , people could enjoy your trip freely .
There is no time limit , so people can go anywhere what they want .
For example , I went to snow festival in Seol Ak mountine with tour guide .
There are so many routine in mountine but I should fellow the guide .
And there was always time limit to comback somewhere if I go someplace what I want to go .
It was bad memory to me .
If someone go to trip , so , I will recommend enjoy travel without guide .
It let them have a time more happier trip .

To be encapsulated , the 2 reasons which I mentioned above make your experience abundantly such as making a freind who live in other countries , going to a lot of place what you want .
Thus , I think travling without guide is better way .
