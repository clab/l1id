I strongly agree with this statement .

When I was in secondary school I had to spend huge amount time in memorizing what year what treaty was signed on , what kind of crop was imported or exported in and out of Korea in what year , what philosopher founded what school of philosophy .
However I do n't remember much of those facts but I still remember the ideas and concepts that I learned from Mathematics or Physics class .

For another example I had attended `` Principles of Economics '' in korea about more than 10 years ago and I learned the same class in America last year .
Though many of the concepts were reminded to me , I could tell the big difference , too .
That was I was not expected to memorize the name of the scholars or several characteristics of each theory without understanding the concept first .
I could not quite grasp the idea before when I read some newspaper article in business section about business trend or reasoning for a new economic policy even after I had finished economics class in high school and college but I am smiling in my mind patting on my back remembering the concept that I learned in class last year not 10 years ago that I just had to memorize short facts and history of economics .

Another good example is even though I was not good at mathematics and had to spend a lot of time solving problems , that time helped me to understand the concept of Math and I still can help other students understand at least level of 8 or 9 th grade .
However I do n't remember not much from history class or chemistry that I had to memorize and memorize all those years , names of people or chemicals .

When you get the ideas and concepts you can utilize it and it is easy to apply to various usages or purposes but when you only try to shovel short facts and knowledges into your brain it is highly probable for you to lose the grip of that knowlege and you wo n't retain it long enough to share it with your children or your students .
