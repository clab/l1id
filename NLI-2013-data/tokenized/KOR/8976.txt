Some people emphasize learning facts at the education My country Korea is also following that belief and whole education is established under that concept .
However , while I go through the 12 year 's Korean education system , I found that it is not good for students .
I prefer the other way , emphasizing understanding ideas and concept at the education , since it makes students be able to use their knowlege , be creative and enjoy learning .

Most of all , even though students know facts , if they ca n't understand them , they ca n't use their knowledge .
When I took music class , teacher explained me about chords - C , D , E , Minor , Major , etc. - but I could n't play music by them .
However , very after I hear those chords by touching the keys of piano and understand what they are , I could play lots of songs .
Such a smart idea it was to understand the concepts , not satisfied by only know them .

Moreover , understanding ideas and concepts make students more creative .
If students learn only facts , they only know about that .
However , if they understand the original ideas and concepts , they can creat and change those in their own way .
This experience may extend their knowledge and give a new concept of futher study .
Indeed , it 's significant to understand ideas and concepts since it make them creative .

Furthermore , students become enjoying learning while they understand concepts and ideas .
As understanding ideas and concepts , they can feel the joy of discovery .
They can feel the feeling of the one who first find the theory .
It make them enjoy learnig and study by themselves .
Always , people who wants to study well , they should enjoy it and understanding concepts and ideas helps them to be like that .

In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is better and more important for students oweing to that they can use their knowedge , become creative and feel joy when they study .
If the education systems of countries follow this way , it might be better for the students of that country .
I suggest my country Korea to choose that way , either .
