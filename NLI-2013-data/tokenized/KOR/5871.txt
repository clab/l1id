In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and I am strongly agreeing on that statement .
Currently the world is changing in extremly fast speed than what we expect .
Especially technology is the part where humans are really concentrating on and that will bring lot of influence to the future car .
Also environmental problem will give influence to stop making car .

According to the news article , the world gasoline will run out in next 10 years .
If there are n't any gasoline left in the world then the car wo n't move .
Currently most of the cars are moving with gasoline and it is in serious problem .
Lot of car companies are feeling this is serious problem , and they decided to make hybrid car .
Instead of making new designed-car they thought making hybrid car will be more efficient car in the future .
Instead of gasoline , they will use alternative energy such as crude palm oil or the sunlight .
Next twenty years will come really fast and probably they ca n't produce lot of hybrid cars so numbers of cars in next twenty years will be fewer than now .

Second lot of environmental issues had been brought by cars and that will reduce the number of cars in the future .
At present , due to air pollution , the global warming is happening .
The ozone layer has the huge hole due to air pollution .
The main reason can be CO2 which is coming out from the car .
To save the world , lot of country will reduce the number of cars to stop global warming .
Anyway as I mentioned in above information , the car wo n't go because there wo n't be any gasolines left so cars which is running with gas will goto junk yards or developed into other tool machines .

With two above evidences , in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Due to cars which are running with gasolines are causing lot of problem to the world and that will reduce the number of cars in the future .
