Are there differences in enjoyment in life comaparing young people and those of whom are older at age ?
Well , I think that is a question that depends on a personality or different backgrounds in which the person came from .
However , I do think that a more younger person will have the advantage in enjoying and having fun in life because they have less to worry about .

When a person becomes older they are more aware and warned of personal and social problems , at school , friendship , grades and so on .
What I thought was the most difficult , while growing up to be a pre-teenager was that I had to conform with others and I had to use the right choice of words .
When you are little you have limited thoughts of how your words may affect others and how you accept differences , but when you grow up , you may be discriminated and segrigated because of your skin color and the clothes you wear , or the way you look .
These problems cause you to worry more and be less out going .
It can also cause you to be depressed and make you choose the wrong choices in life .

At school , not just young adolecents but also college and university students have stress up on managing their time to complete and hand in their assignments in on time .
With the growing stress , you can find yourself caught up on homework and writing essays , which prevents you from having free time to spend for your liking and enjoyment .

When you become older you have to worry about mannaging your deadlines at work , how you are going to pay the bills , conforming with your co-workers and more social problems along with personal stress .
With all of these stress and `` things-to-do '' going on , I do n't think that you will be able to enjoy your life so much as well as a younger person with less stress and less work would .
