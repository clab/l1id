It is debatable whether young people these days do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Some people think that young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their communities because they are usually considered to be selfish and not caring .
However , I disagree with the idea that young people in the recent time do not sacrifice enough time for their communities .

First of all , young people these days are not actually as selfish as they are thought to be .
They do care about their communities and know exactly what they can do for them .
For example , as one person of young people nowadays I have been participated to the charity .
From the experience , I was amased that lot of young people actully sacrfice their lot of time for communities .
They had been working for the poor and any people who need help at least once a week .

Secondly , we can see many articles and issues around us everyday lives about the young people giving their time to helping their communities .
According to the research on the Korean Chosun Newpaper , it is more young people than others who sacrifice themselves in sudden accidental situations by 30 % .

In summary , young people nowadays are willing to help their communities in diverse ways .
They sometimes take long and regular time to help others , and sometimes give great sensibility to save people in danger .
As there is also a saying that `` Sound body , sound mind , '' it is natural for young people with sound body to have sound mind somehow more than other people .
