I believe that in twenty years , there will be more cars than there are today .
Population is increasing , the age requirement for driver 's lincenses are dropping , people choose personal cars over public transport and the building boom in third world countries have increased the need for transportating matirials .
With all of these reasons , it is more likely that there will be more cars in the future despite minor setbacks .

The population in the world is rising , and with more people there will be more cars for them to travel in .
In many third world countries , like China and India , where economy is booming a family normally has 6-10 children who grow up to fill up the ever growing jobs caused by the growing economy .
And although not all of those children survive , half of them grown up to work that requires cars becuase most of their work places are not walking distance .

Also , many people today seek comfort and so a family might own more than one car so that the father could go to work , and the mother could drive the kids to school , ect .
I have seen many families that have more than two cars actually .
Also with more and more people today choosing to stay single and not marry , this causes there to be more cars because families share their cars and single people own their own .
( or maybe even two )
This doubles the number in cars and will continue to do so as long as people choose to stay single for a longer period of time .
Also many people also get sick of their current model and covets a newer model without selling their old car which doubles the car number in each household .

The age requirement to aquire a driver 's license has been decreasing .
For example in Kansas it is now 15 instead of 18 , in the Philippines it is 17 instead of 18 , and in Korea it is now 18 instead of 21 .
The younger they allow kids to drive cars , the more cars you will need , because there will be people reaching the required age sooner than before .
I also would n't be suprised to have the age requirement lowerd even more within the next 20 yeras .

Another reason that we might have more cars in the future is that we are a growing world , economically and industrially .
There are a lot of factories , resorts , hotels , houses and other buildings being built and they all need cars ( trucks ) to transport matirials to the alotted places .
Cities are expanding and more and more people are wanting to find recluse places that they can reside and rest in which require trucks and cars to haul things down to those places .

You might say that gas prices keep going up which will counter act the increase in cars , but statistics show that if people really want to use cars , ( and they are very convenient ) gas prices will not daunt them from driving and owning cars .
Also hybrid cars are being developed , which can be charged by solar batteries rather than using gas consumption .
So with the increase in population , decrease in age requirement , increase in builidng construction , and the increase of comfort seeking people , I think that there will be a lot more cars in 20 years than in the present .
