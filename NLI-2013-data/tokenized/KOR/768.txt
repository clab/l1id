There exist an old Korean proverb , `` Be the best in one field is the best , '' this saying indicates that a profound knowledge of one area is more beneficial .
however , I strongly believe that the wide knowledge of various academic areas is much better because broad knowledge fits with todays world and let people be open minded , First , contemprary society requires the multi-knowledge of many field .
unlike the past , with the advent of the era of the globalization and high techiques , people need to be flexible in work area .
one should have enough foriegn language ability with engineering or other fields at the same time .
soley being the specialist of one field can not catch up with todays changings .
according to the statistics , more than 70 % of CEOs said they prefer multi person because those can propriately step with todays rapidly changing trends .
in this sense , wide knowledge gives good effects on people .

On top of that , a broad knowledge makes people more open minded .
through learing differents and various fields one can raise a sense of understanding other things and broadens his or her horizons .
to take an example , experts have verified that the one who has wide range of academic ability is more likely to accept others opinions because he or she has learned the different but repectable concepts of many subjects .

in this respect , broad knowledge of many areas leads people to a good way .
To sum up , despite some adventages of becomming an expert of one field , those of the wide knowledge far out weigh .
since learing multi areas can confer an ability to adapt to fastly moving world and a good personality , a sense of understanding and open mind .
how can the one stubborn and old-style expert can suvives 21th century ?
