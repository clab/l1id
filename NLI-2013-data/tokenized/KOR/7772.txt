It is generally said that when traveling somewhere we need a group led by a tour guide .
Although a group or a tour guide would give some benefits , however , I definitly belive that the best way to travel is to do alone , because traveling with a group led by a guide is too costly and time consuming .

Above all , the cost of travel in a group and a tour guide supplied by tour companies is extremely expensive .
I experienced that before traveling the Osaka In Japan , the tour company that I chose suggested different options , if I added the tour guide to my travel , the tour company required almost twice cost as another which did not include guide .
Eventually I chose traveling alone and could buy presents for my family and friends with extra money while abroad .
Moreover , nowdays we have a lot of resources about the tour informatation such as books in the library and internet that do not require any cost .
With those methods , we do not need to expensive guides anymore .

Second , within the schduled courses suggested by tour guide , people cannot enjoy the travel entirly .
As each person has different tastes during the travel , naturally there are differences that members want to look at .
For example , when I traveled over the Europe with my family using package program desined by tour company , I felt uncomfortable because I wanted to stay in Paris longer while others did not want .
Unfortunately I could not make schecule changed , I should leave Paris in short times with unsatisfactory .

In conclusions , I disagree with the statement that a group led by a tour guide gives tourists most beneficial method , for the reasons that I mentioned above .
Traveling with a group or a guide contributes a lot of stressful cost and it is wasteful in time-wides .
