Many people argue that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
From staying up late and doing activities to playing extreme sports , many argue that younger people has the youth to do more things that older people cannot do .
Although it is commonly accepted that younger people are less fatigues than older people when participating in any activity , it does not mean that younger people enjoy their life more than older people .
I believe that the statment , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is false .

Being younger does not necessarily mean that they know how to enjoy their time well .
Younger people are usually enrolled into schools and universities , which gives them less if not no time to enjoy their life .
Also when they get older , they must find a job , and work their way up to higher position , where they would have more free time .
Only then would a person be able to enjoy life by doing activities that he/she enjoys .
Since it tends to take time for a certain individual to be in a higher position in one 's own company , people gets to enjoy their life after they get older .

Also Younger people face many disadvantages that older people does not .
Younger people may not have as much freedom as older people do , such as being denied to enter a bar .
Also an older individual usually has more money to spend for leisure time , while younger person might not have as much money to spend anything on .
Being younger does not only bring advantages , which offsets the disadvantages of physical limits that older people often face .

Although many argue that a younger individual has more capabilities , time , and youth to do activities than older people do , I believe that statement to be false .
Each individual 's physical limits are defined by one 's will power and one 's own physical capabilities , and since this is the case , the situation varies among each individuals .
Also since being older can bring positive advantages , I believe that younger people does not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do .
