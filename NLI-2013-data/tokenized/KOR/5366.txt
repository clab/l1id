Traditionally , many people , including those who are going to advertise their own products , believe that adversiments make products seem much better than they are and this enhanced image from the advertisements help to increase the sales of the products .
However , my opinion is that this common sense does not always make sense .

The cheif reason for my view is that ill-manufactured advertisements could have bad effects on the product image or sales performances .
If informations about a certain product which customer want to know from the advertisemet are not provided in the advertisement , most of customers may forget the product after looking at the advertisements .
Moreover , many advertisements could not succeed in focusing on the characteristics which the customer want to catch in the advertisements .

The another reason for my view is that core value or quality of product could not be invented even though most famous artists or advertisement agents manufacture the advertisement .
Real value or real qualities could be diffused by another types of advertisements such as blogs in the internet , word of mouth , or articles in the newspapers or megazines .

Some might argue that even though advertisement could be ill-manufactured or create diffrent effects expected , most of advertisement could create productive effets .
But there are many examples that show how much severely effects the ill-manufactured advertisements had .
For example , a car manufacturer advertisement put a stress on more security-guaranteed facilities in a small car .
But most of prospective small car customers wanto know how much low the price of the new small car because the most of prospective customers will use that car as a second car and have already security-strengthen big cars .

In sum , I concur with the opinion that advertisement could create good effects on the products image or sales growth .
However , I believe that this rule could not apply to most advertisements .
