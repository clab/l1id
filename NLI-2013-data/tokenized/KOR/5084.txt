I personaly think that there are substantial number of people who think this statment is true and I am one of them .
The retionale behind this is that the advertisment is the best way to introduce new product and let potential custers get attention to the products .
Consequently leading the public to buy this product is the final goal .
In order to make the people come and buy the products , advertiment should be more impetus and sensational and advetisment make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertising company use a celebrity to advetise the goods becuase people can easily think that if the celebrity uses a certain product , the goods are good enough to buy and people can get the wrong percetion about a product only because the celebrity uses .
For example , in my country , many advetising companies use one famous commerical star whose name is Ji-Hyun Jeon becaus all the items which she advertised made great sales .
The public regards all the items that she uses as higher-quality than they actually are .
I think the celebrity 's word on th TV commerical makes the products look better .
Moreover , the advertisment is itself very costly .
So the advetisements should be enough to get attention wihin a short time or small space with expressions that can let the people get imagation that the products are good to buy .
For this reason , the companies use computer graphic to make the products .
To illustrate , I have a bad experience that I bought the ear rings online becuase the products of on line adveristment looked so fancy and I was very temping to buy and bought .
However after I recived the actual products , I was so upset .

In a nutsell , for these reasons , I strongly agree this statemtn and advetisment shoud be improved for fair
