When people go to university , sometimes they should choose between learn many subjects and one subject .
Some people believe that specializing in one specific subject is useful for them .
Because they can study one subfect deeply , they can apply theit kmnoweldge to other situations .
However , others agree that having broad konwledge is helpful , Owing to various knowedge , they can communicate with no matter who .

On the one hand , One group think that people can be more professional in one field when they study one specific subject deeply .
Supposing , one have knowledge in one subject , one could develope the subject better than who have less information .
Besides , Knowledge that is focused on one subject could be applied to other subjects .
Specifically , individuals study chemistry , they can connect chemistry and biological .

On ther other hand , another group claim that people can acquire a variety of topic when they learn numberous subjects .
For instance , individiuals do not know when they will meet others , and who they will meet .
However , if they accumulate broad knowedge , they can not only converse easily about any topics , but also deal with the topic that a partner is interested in .

To sum up , I stroghly support that having various knoweldge is better , since if I know many things , I can talk about topic no matter what .
