I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The modern trend of elitism , individualism , and has robbed today 's youth 's knowledge of the inherent value in community service .

In Korea , a nation that has thrived on the basis of human resources , the main source for one 's economic success is one 's ability to perform academically : thus the trend for elitism .
The extreme competition in college admission and the strict education system that follows accounts for the fact that an average student spends at least five hours in an independent learning institution every day .
It is no wonder why these students find no time for community service , save a time for personal leisure .
As youths have been emersed in this merit-based society , they lost sight of the necessity to help the poor and helpless .
After all , if one were supposed to earn one 's way to the top , then does not poverty and hunger stem from the incompetence and neglect of those who suffer ?

Individualism , a western thought that is now spreading world-wide , is another factor for the youths ' neglect of community service .
During the Industrial Revolution , communities that were bound together by economic niches began dissolving due to the development of specialization .
Families and neighborhoods that used to work together on communal farms were separated as they were employed by mass factories .
Due to such a separation , the world today is becoming more and more self-centered and individualised .
The young peoples ' neglect of community service is only one manifestation of this phenomenon .

In conclusion , the strive for economic success and individual gains have blinded the youths of today .
We need to start recognizing that there is a greater calling out there in this world : love .
