Many peole enjoy their lives and they all have differnet ways to fulfill it .
Enjoyment that young people can get from their lives is so much bigger and astonishing .
Old people can never enjoy their life as much as young people do because of their surroundings and age .

The old think too deeply for what they do compared to young people .
I am 18 years old now and i do not think much when i do something , which makes me enjoy my life more .
Young people often do what they want without thinking about the consequences it might cause .
For the old , they always think about the result of what they do since they always have to take a responsibility in any situation .
That makes their lives even more boring that it already is .
As an example if you are a father of two young children , you have to nuture them by earning money and offering them many educational stuff .
You always have to think about your childen .
Even if you want to give up your job and find some other job that you can actually enjoy , you just cannot , for it is a big risk for you to give up your job .
Young people might have something to worry about but they can do what they want without being in a postion where they have to support someone so the change that young people can enjoy their lives is much greater than the old .

As people grow older the abilities of their body cannot but help being decreased .
In nine cases out of ten old people are weak comapred to young people .
They cannot be as active as those young people who play soccer and basketball every day .
As an example you are 60 years old man who has a son .
One day you follow your son to take a walk .
All of a sudden you son starts to run fast .
It goes without saying that you cannot follow him since you are old .
It is something that you cannot control ; as you get older your body is weakened .
Old people might have a great desire for doing new , but to do that they need to be in a good shape .
In a word , they have to be healthy which is really difficulty for most old people .
But for young people they are always active and they do not get tired easily since they are young .
They have more chances to enjoy new things that they have never tired in their life before , which makes their life more intereting and exciting .

Some of old people might feel miserable as they get older and they are likely to find out that their life seems to be boring compared to young people .
But They always have to keep something in their mind , which is everything actually depends on their attitude towards something .
They can change their life in a better or a worse way .
Young peole might enjoy their lives more than the old ; however , that does not mean the old cannot enjoy their lives .
They need to stay postive and find some ways to be more enjoyful .
