Advertisements are made for the sole purpose of increasing customer purchase .
The goal of advertisement itself makes it inevitable for advertisements to make products seem better than they really are .

In an memoir by a former copy writer Augusten Burroghs , the author looks back on his experience in the advertisement field and describes how he felt disgusted when he was forced to create a fake image around a product .
He was assigned to make an advertisement for a shampoo .
His copy told people that the shampoo will give your hair full body and make it look like silk .
The truth was , consumers in the sample group complained that the shampoo smelled like bubble gum and made their hair greasy .
In this case , the advertisement was clearly portraying a false feature of the product .

Another method that advertisers use to make products seem better is artificially creating images around the product .
An example is an Budwiser advertisement .
The advertisement displayed images of young women and men in their twenties , holding a bottle of beer in their hands and dancing , looking as if they were having the best time of their lives .
All the women and men in the advertisement were gorgeous and were portraryed as if they had no worries at all .
This advertisement connects the euphoric image of youth with a bottle of beer .
Research does show that alcohol generally elevates mood slightly .
However , there are serious side affects of drinking alcohol that are not portrayed in this advertisement .
For example , severe drinking is not good for your health and in some cases , may even jepordize your life .
Also , drinking may lead to judgement impairment and many drunk people make mistates which they would have not made if they were in a more conscious state .
The problem with this advertisement is that it is not portraying any of these negative consequences of drinking .

As consumers , we should be critical about the advertisements that we see .
The purpose of advertisements is to persuade us to buy products and persuasion works by only showing the positive aspects of a product which may even be fake in some cases .
It is critical to consider the negative aspects of the product that the advertisements are not showing us .
By doing so , consumer will be able to make better purchase decisions .
