I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Many people can think that older people can enjoy more , but I agree for the following statement .
Many people said that students should always study hard .
I think that 's wright , but not always .
When you are young , you can learn more various things that when you grow up , but I think you also enjoy your life when you are young .
Students are attending classes in school everyday .
And there are many friends in school .
It is very important to study , and get much knowledge from your teacher , but in my opinion , I think to get close and communicate with their frieds are more important .

Some older people said `` I want to be a student '' .
First I heard that , I thoght it is very funny .
I do n't know why they want to be a student .
But I recognize that student can more enjoy life .

Many students meet and hang out together .
I really like that .
When I play with my friends , I can do what I want .
I think enjoy life is doing something what I want .

When you grow up , it 's hard to do whatever you want .
Because you have your family .
So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
