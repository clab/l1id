Have you been any other country ?
I have been Europ and America , Now I am in the America .
Some people said the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour suide , but I disagree with it .

First reason we have to go with other people who I do not like .
This is big deal , such as when I went to the Europ , the guy who very old , bring a Denjang which is smell bad , and he eat this in the restorant when the bread came out .
The other native people cover their nose with their hand , and I feel bad because They will Think the Korean is bad .

Another reason that is the other people can feel bad about us .
Forexample , If the group is big , we can make a big noisy , and the other people can make their feel bad .
Supose you are in the hunny moon , and you went to somewhere very specal .
However the big group of people come and make a noisy .
What you going to do ?

I know the answer .
You will get med of them .
Last reason that we can make different think with guide .
Forexample , When I was 5th grade , I went to the Paris , France in Europ , at night , and we want to go to the Epal tower becuase the light would be beautiful .
How ever the guide do not want to because she was tirde , so we say to bus driver .
The bus driver was very nice , so we went to the Epal tower .
After we went there , she was so med , and the adults fight for pay with guide .

In conculusion , the travelling in a group led by a tour guide is very bad way to travel .
If I travel just with my friends and no tour guide , than I will feel happy than that way .
