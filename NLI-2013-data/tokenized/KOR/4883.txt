There is an old saying , `` Do not judge a book by its cover '' .
It is true and applies to everything and everywhere in the world .
It is impossible to see what the content of the box is only by looking at a box unless a person has an uncanny ability to do so .
A woman with luxurious clothes eating in an expensive restaurant might not be rich because she might have borrowed the clothes from her friend for a day and somebody else was paying for her food .
Same as the advertisements .
Since the purpose of the advertisement is to sell products , it is inevitable to describle products better than they really are .

Every product is covered with some descriptions and pictures on it .
In most cases , the pictures are not exactly same as the real content .
For example , one day , I went to the store to buy something to eat .
Every food looked great to me since I was hungry , and the pictures on the covers looked really delicious .
I bought a bunch of instant food and tried one of them at home .
I put frozen pasta in a microwave , and when I took it out from the microwave to eat , I was greatly disappointed and frustrated .
Although the picture on its cover had big chunks of meats and creamy sauce on softly boiled noodles , the actual food looked totally different from the picuture .

From this example , it can be concluded that it is necessary for food companies or advertisement companies to make advertisement with exaggreational expression or pictures to sell them .
I bought the frozen pasta since its advertisement looked great .
If there were two kinds of frozen pasta with two different covers with the frozen pasta and the other one with deliciously cooked pasta , what would people prefer to buy ?
