I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
People usually buy for looking the products which have good looking shape .
The customers cannot test the products before using it except special events , so the people who make the advertisements pay attention about making good and charming advertisements .
These are the specific reasons what I agree with the statement First , customers want to be a model who shows in the advertisement .
Everybody wants to be a nice guy or a beautiful woman instead of being ugly people .
As a result , the people who make the advertisesements make this kind of advertisements .
For example , If the TV shows very charming hair shampoo advertisement , the model in the advertisement has very beautiful blond straight hair , it blows by the wind and it looks really nice .
If I have think , curly black hair , I can not be as a woman who are in the advertisement .

Second , customers do not know its value exactly .
Just to see an advertisement , the customers never know about its value , since they never tried it before .
Even if the product has very poor value , the customers never know about it before using it .
So , the people who make the advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

Third , customers easily lose their sights about judging the advertisement .
While they are watching the advertisements , they easily lose their minds which they already know about the fake of the advertisements .
Because of this reason , the workers who work for the advertisement company are trying to make the products seem much better that they really are .

For these reasons ; people want to be a cool person , people do not know the product 's value , and people can easily lose their sight about the capacity to judge the advertisements , we should think about the advertisements .
People should aware to watching the advertisements and think again about the products that the people are willing to buy .
