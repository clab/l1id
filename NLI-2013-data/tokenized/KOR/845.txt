When it comes to choosing whether you prefers broad range of knowledges or just one specialized knoweldge , there could be a lot of opinions just as different strokes for different folks .
Some of my opposite numbers would try to win me over by saying ` One specialized knowledge is better ' .
They would come up understandable reasons like ` If you tried to learn a lot of things at one time it will simply overwhelm your self and you may not be able to master just one knowledge pluently ' .

Their reason is quiet acceptable and very tempting however if I am allow to choose one treasure from the various shiny ones I would claim my prize by saying ` I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ' .
There are various reasons to support my idea .
First our lives are limited to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a computer .
So what I figure is if you have limited time to learn might as well learn much stuff as possible .
The second reason is that we are living in fast evolving society and I think the era of one speciallized knowledge is over .
People with broad range of knowledges are treated more nicer than people who just specialized in one academic subjects .
Let me give you one example .
In our country it is very hard to get a reliable job .
We have to faster than others , smater than others , even richier than others .
At the time like this specializing one academic subjects is like a sucide attempt because jobs are limited and companies are looking for more intelligent people .

Come to think of it the idea which my opposite numbers are suggesting is very reasonable .
But I think what they are claming is kind of far from the reality .
Besides I do n't think my opinion is not a far cry from the given subject nethier .
So in conclusion I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have just one specialized academic subject .
