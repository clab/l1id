People can be successful in many fields such as arts , sports , or study .
In my opinion , successful people have enthusiasm that leads them to try and achieve something that seems challenging while other are just being lazy .
As if there is a saying , '' no pain , no gain . ''
.

First of all , I would like to say that people who are successful are challenging taking risks .
In my country , there was a famous swimmer .
He was very famous , especially when he was young .

He used to take all of the medals from the competitions and was considered as the best swimmer in my country .
He was very eager to try the father distance to swim .
after he retired , despite his age ( 40 ) he tried to swim across the river in Korea .
The river was the biggest in Seoul , and the every scenes were being aired on TV .

Even though he looked very hard , people could see that he would success to swim across the river .
After the success , he tried another river and also to the island near the mainland .
Actually , after that , he failed by tireness and long distances , but he kept trying to achieve his goal with his challening spirits .

Secondly , successful people have common in their willngness .
What I mean by that is that people who are successful have strong wills .
There is a singer who is very famous in Korea and Asia .
When I saw him first , he was ugly .
Many people thought that he would probably not be popular and quit the job as a singer .
But his capability to dance and sing was so amazing that people were surprized .
after getting popularity , he had lots of interviews and he used to say that even if he is ugly , he promised himself that he would success as a singer by his talents .
Now he is a attractive and talented singer in Asia .
He never gave up and strived to become a singer despite the people around him who used to oppose him to become a singer .

In a conclusion , successful people have their strong will and challening spritis in common as explained above .
Even if people know how to do something well , if they just lose their enthusiasm , it wo n't certainly lead to a success .
People need to take the strong will before giving up .
