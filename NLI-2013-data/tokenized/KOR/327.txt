In accomplishing something that is risky comes the reward of success .
With success comes satisfaction , envy , prosperity , and confidence .
I believe that the human race would not be the same without the risks that some of our great inventors and leaders took .
It even takes great courage and confidence to be a successful businessman .
Going where no man has gone separates the great from the norm .

The best example of a risk taker that became successful is Bill Gates .
Not only is he the richest man in the world , he created something that almost everyone in the modern world uses , Windows .
Had Bill Gates stayed with Apple and graduated Harvard , who knows what the screen on our desktops would look like ?
Instead , he did exactly the opposite , he took a chance .
Bill took a huge risk by going out on his own to create a program that was not well known at the time it was introduced .
A few years later , Windows became the standard in the computer industry .
Unfortunately , Apple , Bill 's former employer , rejected his program when it was asked to get bought and suffered a huge loss in potential profits by `` doing what they already know how to do well . ''

Even the land of America would not have been discovered and colonized if risks were not taken .
The American pilgrims took a risk in leaving everything behind and starting a new life in an unknown territory .
Then came the Declaration of Independence .
This was a document that accused the forefathers of America with treason .
Had they not taken the chances of complete failure and war against the biggest military power at that time , America may not be the supreme power that it is now .

Even if one fails a thousand time before reaching their goal , the feeling of success is something nobody can take away from them .
Sticking to something that one already knows is not a bad thing , but it will never let a person shine or stick out from the rest - success .
