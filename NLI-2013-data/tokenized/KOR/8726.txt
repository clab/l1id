I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First of all , if we do n't understand ideas and concepts , it is difficult to have good view about facts .
That means we ca n't have our own ideas and opinions .
Therefore , even though we can remember the facts at the time for tests , it is easy to forget the facts .
For example , when I was a university student , I majored in chemical engineering .
There are a lot of concepts and ideas about principles of nature .
It could be impossible to memorize them .
However , I tried to memorize them for test because I did n't study hard .
As a result , I do n't have any knowledge about chemical engineering now .
But many friends who tried to understand ideas and concepts still remember many principles of chemical engineering and they are still using their knowledge to their jobs very efficiently .
Whenever I see them , I envy them .
I regret I just memorized facts without understanding ideas and concepts .

Second , if we only learn facts without understanding ideas and concepts , we are hard time adopting our knowledge to other area .
In other words , learning facts is only for tests , not for real situations .
If we face with same questions that we have learned , we would solve them and manage them well .
However , If we face with different questions even though the concepts of it is same , we could not solve those questions because we have n't seen them before .
This problem will happens because we do n't understand the facts correctly by only learning facts , we do n't have our own ideas and opinions about them .
That 's why we could n't solve them .

In conclusion , when we are in lecture , we will learn a lot of facts which are involved in the lecture and then we must understand the ideas and concepts about the lecture .
It is important to have correct views of them .
