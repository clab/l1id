There are two different things which are idea and fact .
Those are seems like so simular , however , it is so different .
Some people think fact is truth , however in my opinion , it is not true .
What is fact ?
It is the thing that we believe it is true .
For example , before Galileo believed Earth is one , no one believed his opinion .
Facts are usually confined in one paradiam when people are belong in there .

Campare with fact , idea or concept suggest people to think about different way .
For example , the fact which was believed that the Earth is flat , it made people stuck on the thought .
However , the idea which was believed the Earth is one , made Galileo to think about that and research about Earth .
Idea makes people to have more creative ways and method about thought or solution .

Idea is motivation .
When we were young , we underwent that we watched animation on TV .
Usaully the subject was about treaveling in the Universe .
Now we read articles in newpaper that NASA succesed to reach the Moon or the other planet .
These kind of ideas motivated people to estimate and reseach about something that we do not know yet .

We can also feel that idea and concept are more important than fact in the classroom .
Before 19C , especially during the War , school more taught about fact and physical things than idea or creative things .
However , nowadays , schools are changed to teach and encourage about idea and creative method , so they make student to learn about more creative thought .

We still live in industry revolution paradiam .
We still leave to descover about Earth , Universe , or more about technology .
Nowadays ' society is getting to change so fast , so I believe it is better to teach student more about idea which can change to our next paradaim , than fact which might not be truth no more .
