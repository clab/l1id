Someone thinks that a concentrated knowlege is better than a broad knowlege of various fields .
However , it is so arguable issue because both cases have advantages and disadvantages .
However , I strongly believe that people should have a specialized subject for the following reasons .

Fist of all , we should have a special skill or knowledge for getting a job .
when I was an high school student , my uncle lived in my home .
He was a gentlmen for my life .
However , he could not get a job because he had no specific skills and knowledges .
When he was an university student , his overrall grade was almost B - .
He told me that people should have a specific knowledge in intereting field .
He regreted his university life .
However , he had broad knowlege of many academic subject such as physics , chemistry , art , music , and so on .
At that time , I feel that I want to get a special skill or knowlege for my success .

Secondly , all subjects are becoming more deeply .
One hundred years ago , we do not know the special relativity .
At the time , few physicists understood the speical relativity .
However , I am a high school student in Korea .
I learned the special relativity in physics class .
I heard that one or two thousand paper are published in a day in physics .
Espeically , all sciences are rapidly and deeply developed day by day .
Therefore , we should concentrate one or two subjects for researching .
Another example is that we cannot learn everything .
Although people should have a broad knowlege of many academic field , it is less than one percent of whole knowledge in the universe .
In the view point , it is better to specialize in one subject than to learn various knowledge of many academic fields .

In conclusion .
I strongly assert that people should concentrate on a special subject .
First , we need a special skill or knowldege for a gob .
Second many fields of academic subject are becoming deeply .
To overcome this situation , we should study a special subject becasue recent knowledge should be a old one .
