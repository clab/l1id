Many people travel around the world in different ways .
And it is true that one of the best ways to travel is going in a group which is led by a tour gide .
However , I strongly disagree with this way of traveling .
I prefer the way traveling by myself .
And there are several reasons for my way of traveling .

First of all , if I travel alone , without guide , I can experience more valuable things compared with guide traveling .
I agree that traveling in a group led by a guide is convenient and can visit well-known places quickly .
However , while traveling with tour buses you just take pictures or walk around places .
You do n't really have free time to experience something spcial .
As the schedule is too tight , you will just look around many places .
If I travel alone , however , I can spend my time freely and experience something unique .
For example , when I was traveling Malaysia , I actually stayed with native people .
Eventhough we could n't understand throughly , we could become a good friend .
From there I could experience the way of the native people 's life .
It was an unforgettable experience in my life .

Next , most people thinks that traveling with a tour guide will be cost effective but this is not true .
If you travel alone you can actually save more money .
As a tour is operated by a guide company , the company tries to get more profits .
So they increase the traveling fees .
Two years ago , I actually wanted to travel Japan by a tour guide company .
But before I book I checked how much money will cost for the traveling by using the internet .
And it was surprising that the fee which the guide company suggested was two times hire than original cost to tavel .
So traveling with a tour guide is totally not cost-effective way .

In conclusion , the guide traveling is sometimes needed to travel certain places such as Alaska .
But in my opinion , traveling by oneself is the best way .
Because it gives you much experience which is unforgettable and you can save a lot of money .
