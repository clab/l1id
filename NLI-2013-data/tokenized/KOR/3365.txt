People have their own idea whether youth do not give much time to help their neighborhoods .
Some people may say that in these days , some young people do not have enough time to help others .
In my opinion , however , young people do not give time to help others : they focus on their own things and they are more busy than past younger .

First , young people have to concentrate on only their works .
It is generally agreed that young people can not avoid any competitions such as have a job or enter the university .
Therefore , young people do not have enough time to help other people .
For example , if they do not focus on their tasks , they cannot survive in modern society .
Having a job is the very important thing in their life .
They must think only their works for their future .
In this way , younger people cannot have time to help others .

Second , modern society makes young people busy .
Some people might think that young people have a lots of spare time such as vacations .
However , lots of people enjoy their life at an early age because if they get older they cannot have much time to enjoy their life .
For instance , young people make plan at long vacation .
They can go abroad or thay can study other major which young people want to learn .
In this way , young people nowadays cannot spend their spare time helping their communities .

To sum up , young people do not have time to help their communities .
They have a lot things to do and they must enjoy their time when they are young .
All things considered , I can definetely say that youth have difficulty in having time to help their neighbors .
