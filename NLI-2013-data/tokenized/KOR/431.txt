I agree that to have broad knowlege of many academic is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
I have two reason why I agree this opinion : the goal of education and feature of modern society .

First of all , the goal of education makes a good person who is adapted the society .
To make a good person , the school teaches many academic subjects .
Because the person must study the many academic subjects , he would be adapted the society .
For example , two high schools in Korea had another curiculums .
The one had many academic subject in curiculum , and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum .
Which high school 's students were succeeded ?
Answer is the former .

Also , the modern society wants to multipalyer who performs various tasks .
As one might expected , to specilize in one specific skill is better than to have broad skill of various field .
However , this society make a multiplayer .
In my experience , I work my company which has many tasks .
Because I do n't have no various academic knowledge , I can not promote the manger first time .

It is commly belived that to specilize in specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
But , this opnion is not available nowadays .
To know many things is allowed to victory the competitions .
