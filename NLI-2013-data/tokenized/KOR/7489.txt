It 's often said that travel without a tour guide is a countless benefits living in a state of art society .
However , I strongly argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because people do n't have enough knowledge about the place they go and it will save to waste of time .

To begin with , Group travel with a tour guide have positive influence on gathering information .
A tour guide is specialized in traveling , so the man know a countless of knowledge about the place which people travel such as popular parks , beautiful restorants , and even world famous traditional foods in the place .

For example , when I was a freshman in university , I planned to journey to USA .
Although I searched information about the country , when I was in USA , I could n't find any places where I really wanted to go .
That 's because the information i found was not up - date one .

Moreover , the travel help people save traveling time .
Most of group tours have a well planned schedule .
It prevent people waste of time to see the place which people do n't need to go to .
For instance , my sister , Juny Kim , went to Canada with a group members in 1999 .
even though it was just a week to travel , she and her group members traveled all around Canada 's famous places such as UBC in Vancouver , Quback and even Rocky mountain because of tight schedule of a special guide .

In conclusion , without any doubts , I significantly agree with a group travel because of benefits from saving traveling time within tight schedules and gathering information .
If you do n't enough imformation where you will go abroad in this winter , I suggest that you have only two decisions .
One is you should give up the plan and the other option is traveling with a tour guide .
