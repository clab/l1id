It is contraversial issue that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities whether or not .
Some people might agree with this statement because they spend time to watch television and play games .
However , I disagree that they use the Internet for making their interrest things for meeting and communicate long time to MSN and cellula phone .

To begine with , the internet in meeting is made young people .
As one might expect young people are likely to long time in fornt to computer .
They communicate their interrest thing like sport , food , and cloth .
We know that the internet have a lots of cafe .

In addition , they communicate to MSN and cellula phone .
Accord to the Korea Daily Newspaper said that young people spend 5 hour per day to the internet massanger .
For example , my sister also spend time to MSN .
And she talk with her friends .

In brief , young people take time helping their communities in order to making meeting and using MSN and cellula phone for their comminities .
