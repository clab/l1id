There has been a on going debate whether it is better to study a wide range of academic subjects .
Some people do not support the idea because they can not focus on one subject so they can not acquire deep information .
However , from my perspective , it is better for people to have wide range of knowledge in several academic fields because it will broaden their view to world and they can have a lot of experiences that they can apply to other fields .

First of all , they can have wide perspective to the world we live in .
This will lead them to have more open mind in society .
Especially when they are with other people , they can understand other people 's lives better because they study diverse academic subjcets so that they know how different opinions do each individuals have .
Not only can it help them to accept other people 's view better , but also it is beneficial for them to have rational thoughts .
They will not tend to be biased .
Additionally , for example , If I study science and history at the same time , I can think logical concept and moral value at the same time .
Thus , it allows me to get along with everybody as I am well-grounded on interacting with others .

Moreover , by studying a variety of academic subjects , they can acquire numerous experiences which they can apply into other fields .
For example , If I once had studied about computer and now I want to get a job in mathematic field .
Indeed , my experience as to computer skills can be applied into math too .
In order to collect data for surveying , there will be a lot of computer works required .
As we can see , learning diverse field can help people to get their knowledge once and they can use these information in several form of their assets .

Although some people prefer to concentrate their studying in specific field , I maintain that it will bring out more benefits to people to have wide knowledge of many academic area .
This is because that it allows them to obtain wider view and they can have more experiences which can be used in order to success in modern society .
