I think it 's probable idea that the use of cars will be decreasing from 2 decades now .
As we think of the speed of science development , it 's true that most people think the use of cars will be decreasing tremendously .
Not only the reason of the development of technology , but also the larger exploit of natural resources .
Besides , there are also some facts which makes people to think like that .

We 've often seen the news or Tv about the possibility of flying cars .
Truely so , in 10 years , most technicians assumes that it would be possible to ride the flying car .
And from this moment , multitude of people will prefer to having flying cars instead of normal cars .

However , these are not the only reason .
Nowadays , technicians from the many kind of field worries of the deploring of natural resources .
To prepare the deploring of natural resources they 're eagar to make substitute resources .
Furthermore , a few of them are now being used in our daily life .

Also , in 20 years , every single city or rural areas will be developed as a convinient transportation places where it is not essential to ride car to move anywhere .
Naturally the number of in use of car people would choose the use of more convinient transportation than cars .

Furthermore , it 's poplular for all people `` The Well Being '' .
Many people started to care their health and exercise more harder than ever .
If this trends goes on for 20 year , for their health , most people will choose to walk or use the convinient transportation .

It is mutual hopes that most people wants to reduce the number of car users or car numbers not only for the air pollutions or traffic problems , but also to elevate the quality of our life .
But , there are always exceptions in any cases .
It would be plausible for people to use their cat who have their car in an emergency or haphazard .
Also it 's possible people who likes more to use only their car .
so after 20 years , it would be possible to reduce thenumber of car users and also cars and peole will use their car efficiently .
