I agree with try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

The world is changing very fast .
Do you think that you can live without the advance of skills or technology ?
I do n't think so .
The poeple are becoming more intelligence and talented than those of 100 years ago .
Human beings are always want to be advanced .

First of all , even primitive people invented a lot of things to eat , hunt and retain the stuff .
At first , they probably did n't know how to turn on the fire .
They tried several times to get what they wanted to have .
If they had not tried to get the fire , nobody would have gotten it .

Second , to live twentyfirst century is not easy , and thesedays the competitiveness is very fierce .
The technology is advanced very high and everyday new products are coming to attract the customers eyes .
Even if someone has very unique skills , sooner or later the other person will imitate these skills or invent new skills .
Everyday is different , we have to invent new stuffs and think of new ideas .
If no , we will never win others .

Finally , as i just said , now is very hard to be successful person without inventing our skills .
We must know one thing before inventing something .
We probably will fail sometimes while we are doing something .
It can be happened .
Even though we fail , we have to keep make an effort to get what we are thinking .
To invent news things or skills , people have to be very brave and take risk .
For the first time , they might fail to invent but they do n't have to give up inventing .
If they give up because of the scare of the fail , they will never be grown and get what they really want .

Being a successful person is not esay , we have to keep doing until we get what we think .
