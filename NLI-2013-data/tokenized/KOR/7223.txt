People can choose between traveling with a group of people and alone .
Some people prefor trip alone because they are able to enjoy travel without other 's interruption .
However , I am in favor of traveling with a group escorted buy a tour guide .
This is mainly because people are able to deal with a unexpected accidetns and it is easy way to get useful traveling information .

First of all , people are able to ask help when they face the accident .
As one might expect , one would be likely to meet the emergency while traveling .
According , even though they fall in trouble , they are able to ask help to other members of group .
To illustrate , according to the research by the Dong-A travel , one of the most renowned travel megazine in Korea , 71 % of people who travel alone experienced trouble .
On the other hand , only 23 % of ones who travel with group of people falled in the dangerous situation .
If they had traveled with their friends , they would have avoided the emergency .

Furthermore , traveling with a group and tour goide is easy way to get informatin .
It is obvious that travel guide have large amount of information about the new location .
Consequently , by traveling with guide , people are able to get useful information about the new place and exchange with group members .
For instance , when I was freshman , i traveld to the Europe with my friend .
I did not have any knowledge about the Europe .
However , one of my friend , whose major is european history , give us large amount of knowledge related to the Europe .
If i had traveld alone , i would not got the useful information .

In brief , I stongly agree with the idea that travel with a group led buy a tour guide is best way to enjoy travel .
This is laregely because , individuals are able to avoid the emergency and are able to get useful information easily .
All in all there is a saying , `` The more , the merrier . ''
