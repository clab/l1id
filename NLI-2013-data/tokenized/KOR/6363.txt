I strongly agree this statement .
Generally today people are more and more interested buying cars as an important necessity , and this trend does not seem to stop for the time being .
However in twenty years a lot of changes will happens , such as technology will be advanced better , cyberspace will be more wider , and the concept of space will diiffer .

First , in twenty years , there will be considerable change and advance in technology .
That means new vehicle will appear instead of big cars .
Just think of the past .
When people used only carts or bicycles , they may think that kind of vehicles are essential to their life .
Who could imagine cars or airplains ?
Similarly , we may not need cars ant more in twenty years .
Totally different vehicle , more convenient , more safe , will surely appear .

Second , more and more people now can work and study at home without moving .
That is because we can use cyberspace or network system freely and efficiently .
People maybe do not want crowded street , wasting precious time and taking risk of car accident any more .
We wiil not need the vehicle itself in twenty years .

Third , many scientists from many countries now are working on discover more space over the earth .
If it comes true , the concept of space will be different at that time .
We can use only cars on the streets on the earth , but we cannot use cars in the air in other planet .
In different environment , we will use different vehicles or extremely we may not need any vehicle .

In short , I think the use of cars is just appropriate for now .
A lot of changes will happen , though we cannot imagine what will be like .
Cars are just the useful invention of NOW , but it will be useless after humans are sick of them .
There is no limit of human 's satisfaction .
