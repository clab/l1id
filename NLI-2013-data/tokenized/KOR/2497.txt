I disagree with the statement .
Young people have hard time loving their life because of the stage of adolescence .
On the other hand , older people spend their lives as they want to because they are far more experienced than the young .

I am a teenager , and I have seen a lot of my friends struggling in their lives because they do not know what they should be doing .
Also , this is the time of adolescence where many teenagers view the world differently from adults or children , and often become too emotional or revolting .
For example , when I first enrolled in my high school , I was very depressed .
This was because I kept believing that school was a place where young people my age were being measured by the grades that they received .
As I kept thinking that this was a horrid idea of recognizing one individual as good or bad , I found anger in my self , and I could not enjoy my life .
I also did not know what field I wanted to persue my career in , so I was very confused and pressured .
I think this time of my life was a time of struggle because I was quite young and did not have enough experience in life to make important decisions .
Being young means learning about life and going through different emotions .
Young poeple suffer internally and this is why I believe that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people .

My grandparents are one example of why I think that elders enjoy life more than that of the young ones .
Since my grandparents are both retired from their jobs , they have plenty of leisure time to spend .
My grandparents travel every month to different places in the world .
Since they have earned enough money in their younger years , my grandparents are able to entertain themselves more than others .
Also , they have more life experience , which means that my grandparents are able to figure out what is the most fun and benefitial to themselves .
Like this , I believe that older people can live a free life , doing whatever takes them to be happy .

Young people often have to go through difficulties in their lives , such as finding their true talent , peer pressure and worries on how they will survive in the `` real '' world .
On the other hand , older people can live a relaxed life doing what they find the most joy in .
They also have more experience in living , so they are wiser and know what is best for them .
Therefore , I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people .
