It is thought that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with this idea .

DespiteIf students study hard , they cannot memorize a long time ; if students learn just facts , they will not memorize what they learned .
When a students read a book about their studies , if the students just read all text with out understanding , the students cannot explain how was the book is .
If a student have excellent memorizing ability , a student can remember everything without understanding ; not only is it hard for students to have , but also every people cannot do .

To understand ideas and concepts are provide students with an opportunity to use information atpprociately that they lened in studies .
Only students learn facts , they can use information .
But without understanding has limit to use .

Students learn more easily if they undertand ideas and conceots then if they learn only facts .
When a students learn a vocabulary , A which way is more easy to use and memorize ?
