In the course of our lifetimes , most of people get education .
I agree with that satement .
to understand ideas and concepts are more important than it is for them to learn fact .
first , to understand ideas and concepts leave long time to mind .
second , to understand make students find facts themselves .
these reasons developing this essay .

Frist , to understand ideas and concepts leave long time to students mind or brain .
That means , just learn facts are not going to leave temporaty to students .
because they know about facts thus they are not try to find facts .
for example , I have been read the article which is about student 's studying behavior .
it tells about when students solve the threir math problems , some student can see the answer sheets , however others ca n't .
the result is to solve the math problems without the answer sheets students keep try to understand find the answer and to understand .

Second , to understand ideas and concepts make students find facts thenselves .
if before they knew about the fact of problem , they do not want to get proof of the problem .
it makes student lazy .
if always students get fact easily , they can not adoped with to understand idea .
for example , here is one student , who knows fact but does not know how to ~ ?
or why ?
that student can not develop own ability .

In conculusion , the best way is to understand ideas and concepts and than find or learn fact .
and the fastest way is to learn facts .
however , student have to learning whatever also they have to keep trying own their works .
therefore more important for atudents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
