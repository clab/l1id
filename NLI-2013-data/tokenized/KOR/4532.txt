Even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable in making the advertisements , I totally agree that most of them are n't satisfying consumers ' expectation .
I 'd like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion .

In the first place , they including CEOs and ads makers are trying to make their products seem better than product 's reality because if they do that , they can make more money .
For example , there is a car commercial which is shot in the paradise .
If they do that , people , most of consumers , would expect that we 'll be there if we buy this car .
As a result of this , by shoting the commercial in ideal place , the car company would make much of income .

Second , I want to argue my opinion as using current situation .
Many countries , especially developed which , the rate of asking refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies .
This situation is not only happened in famous companies but also small , develping companies .
Why is it happening ?
I think that because of unreality of advertisement make this situation .
In addition , if the companies did that againg and again , they will be charged more money and make this worse .
I 've read the article about this problem , in which the expert said since many company are pouring their much of money in commercial and ads , they ca n't afford to use their money to improve their products .
So it will even cause the situation worse than now .

From that kinds of account I asserted my opinion .
Moreover , as I wrote it , I think the companies which waste their money in meaningless thing should their money in the good reasons such as improving the quality of their product and making new polic
