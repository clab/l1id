I agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Our current society gives more opportunities to young people than old people .
Thus , young people have more oportunities that they can find things that they can enjoy .

First , young people do more activities than older people .
young people who living in society , they have to do a lot of things .
Some people have to do work and some people have to s tudy for their future .
also these are decided by their own opinion .
Young people can decide what they want to be and what they want to do .
they can find happiness while they are doing something .

I always thinking that I want to be a jouenalist .
That is why I would like to researching people and reading a book .
I really enjoy things that I do and I am happy to study that I want to do .
Aometimes I saw people who does not have to learn any more like my grandmother .
My grand mother graduated from Korea-University and right after graduation she went to China for learn Cinese .
However , she does not study anymore and just stay at home .
one day , when I visit her , she asked me that what I want to be and I told her I want to be a Journalist .
I remember she told me that do it hard wharever I do because she thought when she learn somthing that she want to was her happiest time of the life .

Second , also , young people have more opportunities that they can get involve the group .
In our society , people need to live with other people .
If people live alone they can never be happy and never enjoy their lives .
I think young people have more opportunities that they can meet more people than older people .

Almost young people are belonging many kinds on groups , suchas class mates , church people , also whatever they do for their habits .
Old people might belonging groups but according to research from the Korean-Broadcast that I remember said compare to young people group and old people group of book club , young people group have more activities like trip , meeting and discussion .

These are the reason of why I agree with the sentence `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
Because young people have more opportunities than old people , they can enjoy their life more than old people .
