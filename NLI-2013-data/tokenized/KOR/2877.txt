I do n't think that only young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .
It 's depended on how someone 's mind is .
Actually , young people have many things to enjoy more than olders have .
But some of youngers can have boring lives .
Even though a person is enough old , he can be more enjoyable than youngers .
The mind is matter .

I 'm actually one of people who think that the life is boring .
I came to the USA with when I was seventeen years old .
Everyone has said to me that I was too late to learn English perfectly because I was almost adult in my country , South Korea .
And I thought I was too late , too .
I really have spent my two years meaninglessly , doing something like thinking of going back to Korea .
My common days were not enjoyable to me .

But strangely , my mother is spending her life in the USA more enjoyably , and actively than in the Korea .
Even though her English is not good that much , even worse than mine , she says that she thanks to have chance to move to America .
Before I heard it from mom , I thought that she had harder time than I did , because she was pretty old to get into new society , which is difficult to non-English speaker .
However , now she enjoys her life more than others .
She enjoys to make foreign friends and mail them more than people who are younger than her .
Happiness is not at only youngers , it is given who knows how to enjoy his or her own life .
