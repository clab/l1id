I do not agree with the statement saying there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
First of all , car industries will not allow such thing to happen .
In some companies , cars are deliberately built to last less than 10 years , so the owners will buy new cars more often .
They consistently produce more cars and ways to encourage people to buy and use them .

In some countries , even the government encourages automobile consuming .
Those countries build more and more roads and also expand the already existing ones , so more cars can easily get on the road .
The government , or the city planner , could have built more railways and mass transportation instead of more roads if they wanted to reduce traffic and pollution , but the government fears that the automobile industry , which is a major part of the country 's economic , will fail to increase if they take such policies .
Building more roads instead of building complicated mass transport system might also be in fact a cheaper solution , and the only solution available at that time for reducing traffic in the short term .

The second aspect of using cars is that the people who have been driving will not easily go back to walking or using mass transportation unless it is a much better substitute for driving .
Driving and having an own car gives you the kind of privacy not easily gained by using mass transport , and going back to an old habit needs a lot of determination .

The types of cars used today might be used fewer in the future , but new and better types or cars will dominate the future .
The downside of driving was to have to concentrate on driving and keep an eye on the road , but more and more technical developement allow drivers to drive less and let the artificial intelligence do the work .
There will also be cars with less , hopefully no pollution .
The cars will almost definately be much less noisy than the ones today .
The comfort of driving or riding on cars will consistently increase , because the companies investigate for reserches in those areas .

Because of these reasons , the overall number of cars and the usage of them is more likely to increase than decrease .
