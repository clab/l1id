Unlike past , we are living in an era where tons of informations are going around every single moment though books , the internet and other means of communications .
The world is more complicated and complexed .
To survive from these kind of environments , I believe , it is very important to have various knowledge of many academic subjects .

First of all , having borad knowledge is very helpful to make social connections .
If you are at a party , you meet various people .
To be successful in social life , it is important to make conversations and meet people at social gathering .
People now days have all various interests .
To communicate with others and continue conversations , you need to know what others are interested in not just know details of mathmatics for instance .
That 's how people make friends and become social these days .

Also having various knowledge will help you getting a better job .
These days , companies are requring new face who have comprehensive ideas .
Recently I had job interview .
The question I got was solving problem of Seoul 's environment with historical knowledge and stastics which are totally two differnt academic fields .
As I were similar to both of the subject not detaily but enough to answer the questions , I was hired at the position .
And I am not the only example at nowdays job market .

In addition , things are more complicated these days .
So as the problems we are facing everyday life .
To solve those problems , most times details of one special academic subject does n't give us solutions .

Therefore I storongly believe , acheiving comprehensive knowledge of many different academic subjects are much better than specializing in one specific subject as for those living in modern life .
