I concur what the statement says .
Since i went to a lots of countries in many different kinds of ways , the best experienced i had was to travel as in a group led by a tour guide .

When I was eleven years old , i went to Phillippines with my family and we thought we would have fun not chasing by time becuase usually with groups we are chased by time .
But throughout the trip , since it was our first time visiting Phillippines , we did n't know any places so just looking for the good places , we spent one day just researching for places .
The following day , my parents borrowed a car and we bought a map but then it was hard to get to the place because all the poplular places were far away .
There were always full of people and there was traffic jams , when we got to the place , my dad was all ready tired .
But if have gone with a tour guide , since guide knows where to go and about the places , he will explaing to us about that places and give us great information .

Those are the reasons why i like to go trip as in a group led by a tour guide .
Travelers do n't have to drive and we can look at the views in relaxed mood .
We go to trip to have comfortable and have exciting time and we go to travel to get away from our normal same day lives .
What is the point of going to travel , if we are having tired days like as normal days ?

Also , if we go as a group , we get to meet a lots of new people with diffrent chracteristics .
I am outgoing and social so it was always fun to meet new people .
In conclusion , i again agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Traveling in as a group is a best thing to do !
