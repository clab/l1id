Before deciding which side I will stand , I would like to querry what is defined as successful people .
If successful people mean people who made a big advance in our life , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
However , if successful people mean people who live well doing their jobs well , I think successful people are those who only do what they already know how to do well .

First , you should know the history of human 's first exploration of the moon .
I think the people who were involved in that momentous event are those who are successful .
Unless did they plan to travel to the moon and enact their plan , we could have made no progress in our knowlege of the universe and our technology in relaion to aironaut .
With respect to human knowlege advance , I believe that successful peopel are those who try to do what has not been done .

Second , I even can observe how people move towards what they want .
For example , my husband make seemingly unfeasible things possible .
When he faces a barrier , such as dealine , facility unavailities , and job opening , he tries evey means .
He call to companies that do not announce any jod \ b opening .
But , he advertise himself and get a position .
He enjoys his way of life , which seems to make him as a successful person .

However , I also can find people who lives well without a big challenge .
For example , medical doctors seem to live well following well-defined paths .
Although they have to study had in roder to get into a medical school , I think they do not have to try new medical procedures .
On the ready-established path , they are considered as successful people .

In sum , it is difficult to devide people into successful and unsuccessful people according to whether they try new things and take risks or not .
Rather than , I think successful peole could be defined according to whether individual lives the way of life they value .
If a person who pursues taking a risk lives by trying new opportunities , he would be a successful person .
If a person who pursue a challenge lives in a way that is already established , he would not be considered as a successful person .
