Most people like to travel .
Some of them are trying to travel by themselves .
On the other hand , rest of them intend to follow a tour guide .
Both of them have each reasonable advantages .
However , I do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
If I have a chance to travel , I will travel alone or with a few friends .

Firstly , I believe that traveling is to get my own expirence .
Initially , I know that following a tour guide is more convenience , but I think that purpose of traveling is not being convenience .
Expiriencing new world and new culture is goal of it .
I had two exprience of travel .
One of them was travel to Japan , and another was travel to U.S. the travel to Japan was not to follow a guide .
My friends and I made every plan and reservation .
Surely , It was a little bit difficult but experience that we got at that time made us mentally strongly .
On the other hand , travelling to U.S. was fun and easy for a guide , but I did not have any special memory about that trip .

Secondly , One of meaning of travel is take some space from our regular lives .
If we travel alone or with just a few friends , we can do it .
But , following a guide should not allow to do it .
There are so many plans and events .
Sometimes those things can make a travel funny , but often those can make it irritating .
Nobody wants to spend money on meaningless things .
If a travelling is a way that make you escape your life and refresh , which one is more helpful ?
