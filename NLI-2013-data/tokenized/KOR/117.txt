I believe young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities and I do not agree with the statement .
In this century , the number of elders are increasing continuously .
By that , it became more important to maintain elders in the community .
The point is that it is usually those teens and yuong people in 20's who help old ladys on the street or go to nursing house to serve the elders .
I had volunteered many time with friends to take a walk whth elders who live alone .
Adults are not doing these works saying that they are tired of work or they do not have much time to do so .

Adults are also using young people to do additional works .
School teachers are a commom example of this situation .
Teachers order students to pull out grass and pick out small stones out of school gardens after school .
I rather believe that adults are the one that does not try to help their community .

I also saw many young people volunteer on their own and they were willing to do it .
In Korea , young people work as helpers at subway stations and mostly at the nursing house .
They also go to police stations or post office to clean up the place .

As universities are putting a rule on additional scores to those who volunteered for the community , more youngs now have chance than past .
Accordingly , more people will try to help the community .
Although it is not an active way , it is good to the community considering that adults are busy working and there is not much people to work for community .

For the reasons and examples above , I disagree with the statement and young people put enough time to helping their communities .
However , I think there needs to be more improvement to both adluts and youngs to actively help their communities .
