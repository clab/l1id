there are many types of teaching style in school .
Some teachers emphasize to understand idea and concepts , but others emphasize just fact and result .
Both of teaching styles might have adventages .
However , I think the statement that unerstanding idea and concept is more important than learning facts .
Before we know a result , we have to know procedure , and we have to understand ideas and concepts to know procedure .

In Korea , they emphassize fact and result .
we just learn how to approch the facts and results .
we do n't know why some facts do that .
we just know the facts .
We just memorize the fact .
For example , when I learned about multipling , I just memorize the facts as 2 multiply by 2 is 4 , 2 multiply by 3 is 6 .
It also happened in high school because students in Korea have to take a Korean S.A.T for going to university .
Korean S.A.T questions want to just fact .
In contrast , In the united states , they emphasize to understand ideas and concepts .
Students in the United States learn mathmatics less than Korean students , but they learn why the fact happens .
It 's different .
Students in Korea learn `` How '' , but Students in the United States learn `` why '' .

A friend of mine , for example , came to the united states when he was a high school students .
At that time , he was good and high grade about mathmatics in his school in the United States because he previously learned in Korea .
However , when he went to a university , and he also studied mathmatics , he could n't very well rather another american studens because he did n't understand the ideas and concepts , also he did n't know procedure .

it is not only mathmatics .
So , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important and a kind of best learning skills .
