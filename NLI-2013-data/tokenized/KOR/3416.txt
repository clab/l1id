The more technology develop , the more people are required to have a lot of work to do .
Of course , the fact that young people do not want to give time to help their communities is a bad happening .
However , if they already get streessed out by overloading work , how can they care about their communities .

First , most high school students living in Korea should stay in their schools for almost all days .
They have a lot of strees to have to enter the good university like Seoul National University .
They are forced to study hard in a school .
Actually , the forcing that they should study hard and hard is decreasing lately .
But there are still many students who are forced to study in their schools from eighty am to ten pm .
If they spend most time which they can have in a day on studying , I doubt that they can help their communities or poor people , even if they are truely interested in it or want it .

Moreover , there is another serious problem .
Most parents and most atmosphere in societies have been instructing young people as selfish ways .
They say that helping other people or communites is useless because that can benefit them .
Most people estimate a stuff what byproducts it can make , especially money .
People think that if some event can make a lot of money , it is definitely worth to consider .
But if that can not make money , for example helping poor people , free service for disable people , and aiding senior people , most people tell their children that they do not have to spend their time on it because it will not help thier ability or career .
If their children concentrate on it , their parents think their children may not keep up with other students and then they will be defeated in competitions .
Looser means people who failed in their life .

To conclude , it is not that young people do not want to spend their time on helping communites , maybe it is just that their parents and the society do not want them to spend on it .
