In addressing whether younger people enjoy life more than older people , I cannot state for certain .
However , I think that enjoying life is not heavily dependent upon age , but rather on the different situations of each person .

Admittedly , young people seem to enjoy life more than older people on the outside .
This is because younger people are more vibrant , adventurous , and have more energy .
They have less responsibilities than older people , giving them more freedom to explore and have fun .
But I cannot rule out the burdens that I have experienced growing up .
For example , the pressure of entering university , then graduating , and then acquiring a job .
It seemed that overcoming a hill led to an even bigger mountain .

However , I cannot ignore the fact that as people grow older , they have achieved many things along the way .
For example , a stable job , leisure time to do hobbies , birth and nuture of children are just some of the things that can lead to an enjoyable and fulfilling life .
In addition , the period after retirement seems so liberating and enjoyable .
But on the other hand , older people have more responsibilities , meaning less time to yourself to enjoy life .

It seems that who enjoys life more , the younger or older , does not depend on age , but rather on how the individual grows up and becomes older .
Some people may think that their childhood was a disaster , without many good memories , while being at there happiest at an older age .
On the other hand , some people may miss their childhood and wish that they could go back to the innocent days when they were free to do whatever they wanted .

In conclusion , I do not fully agree with this statement , as questioning happiness based on age does not produce a reliable answer .
Rather happiness , whenever experienced depends on the individuals life
