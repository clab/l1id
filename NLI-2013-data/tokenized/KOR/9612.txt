While i am living in present time , I have never seen people who do not want to be a wonderful person .
As developing in socity , most people always pursue to get success from their degree .
And Konwledge continuously keep going on changing for fitting in new things .
Also we have to chang mind from old thinking to new one .

For examples , we can see bill gate who is richman as employment of computer company .
He constantly try to develope software or hardware until now .
Even thoug he has big house and has been became riceman , he never give up in his business and always concentrate on fousing how to make a special products .
Althogh he experienced failure , took risks in a whole part of his life or he already konw how to do well , he tries to do rather than another employment of computer company .
Therefor , he can do anything and then he can keep his work in top of firms .
I like him because
