I agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years later than today .
There are several cconditions to make this phenomenon possible .
First , the fuels for cars will be almost depleted in the future .
This condition will render to decrease the amounts of usage of the cars .
The usage of car will be distinct , when the energy source of the cars are all used up .
It will continue until the other energies are discovered .

Second , there will be other transportations which can replace the cars .
There will be a huge change in technology and science , thus other transportation can be developed .
For example , the airplane can be produced in small size , small as cars , with large amounts , and by low cost .
Thus , it can be used as cars we uses in the present .

Last , the tranportations will not be needed at all .
As I stated on the last paragraph , there will be a huge developement .
A machine that can send people or materials from one place to another place can be invented .
If this kind of machine is invented , it will be worthless to use any transportation .

In sum , there will be fewer usage of the cars in twenty years later than that of the present .
It will be fewer due to the lack of the source of energy , or the developement of other transportations , or the invention of the machine that can convey people and materials .
