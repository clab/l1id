I agree this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Our common sense is not to try towad risk area .
however , No try new thing means no new happening in our lives .
As I read this statement , I remind the pastor Cho ' story who established the full gospel church in Seoul .
He started samll church in country side which lived many poor people .
As his ministry grew , he moved a little bigger church .
His church number was around 1000 numbers .
God gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 number .
He did n't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time .
He could n't see any reasonable things to start it .
It was big risks .
It might be worse if it influeced toward his church numbers because all elders of church number were not agree with his opinion .

However , He began it against all environments and conditions .
So some of church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harship for new church .
But His church number became over 700,000 numbers becuase the location the church was bulit , became the core of city of seoul .
All so important building such as the building the national broad casting and govenment , were established there .

The other reason is that all most people try to do what he or she knew well .
That means that there are so competitive in that area .
If He or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others , it is rare to get success .
Let 's think about one example .

There are a lot of Pizzah store in our area .
many of us know how to make it .
it is also not much risks for managing compnay because it is famillar for each of us .
However , it is easy to make it as well as to be known how to do it .
