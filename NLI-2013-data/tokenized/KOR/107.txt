It is often said that eoungh time to helping their societies was not given to young poeple in modern society .
Some poeple might think young poeple did not spend their time to do something for their communities , in terms of their lots of work to do .
However , i disagree with the idea that young poeple do not spent their time helping their societies because of the importance of volenteering activities , and the importance of guarding society .

To begin with , the significant of volenteer work are oncreasing these days .
It is obvious that volenteer activities are a mendatory for university students to get a job .
For examples , The Ministry of Labor in Korea resarch the importance factor that company select the person .
Accordong to their resarch , activeties for their communities are almost doubled than their scores in university .
From this atmosphere of the sociey encourages young poeple spend their tome for their communities .

In addition , Young poeple realize that we can not maintain our lives without helping each other .
It is commonly observed that the crime rate are incresing in modern society .
This risks give rise to the changes that young poeple think they are the poeple who gurad their communities by themselves .
For instance , my village can prevent the crimes thanks to the young poeple security club 's activeties .
They , include I , guard my village in turns respectively every once a month .

In conclusion I firmly believe that young make an effort to thier societies in terms of the atmosphere of modern society , and their won idea for guarding their communities .
