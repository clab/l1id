I definately agree with the statement that it is important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts for the reasons below .
First , understanding concepts can lead one to more profound information while only learning facts can only be just knowing facts .
Because Just like trees , under the big concept branches grows .
This idea applies every subject people study .
For example , When learning history , people can possibly say `` Hitler caused the world war II. '' which is true , but in this situation we do not know why Hitler did .
However if one say Hitler caused the World War II because Germans were so overwhelmed with the treaty of versailes and Germany wanted to show that they are powerful , It will make more sense , and it will be more easier to understand it as well .

Second , understanding concept can save large amount of time .
For students , using their the time properly is very important .
breaking their time wisely can make their life easier and sometimes they even determines their success as well .
In my opinion understanding concept instead of learning facts is more productive way of studying .
As I mentioned above , understanding concepts not only leads to more information but also leads to know the facts faster .
Once , I had friends who did not spend much time on studing but getting better grade , and who was so struggling with their study and spent great chunk of time , but did not get a good grade on it .
And I realized that their approach to the topic was different .
The smart one was trying to get the big picture of it while one was trying to see the small parts of it .

When drawing a picture , people measure and sketch it first instead of drawing details .
Because if not , the whole structure collapse .
For those reasons , it is very important to see and understand the big concept rather than learning facts .
