People have different oppinions on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I oppose the statement for the following reasons .
First , getting a job is important .
Second , broad knowldge can have when I need easily .
I will explain in detail .

First of all , people with specializing in one field are likely to be employed .
In the past , most universities taught broad and academic knowledge rather than specific knowledge .
However , nowadays many universities teach about practical knowledge for high rate of employment portion .
This is because many companies require students with spocialized knowledge and most students want to get a job right after graduation .
