I think that we will see fewer cars on the road in 20 years from now non .
Even though cars broght us many conveniences so far , together came many problems with cars .
They have been polluting the evironments ; are exhausting natural resources ; and are not safer means of transportation than others .
So governments and companies are developing other transportatin methods .
People will ahve to choose other means of moving than cars .

First , environments have been polluted by cars so badly that we have to take drastic measures to block more pollution before the situation gets worse beyond our capability .
The experts say that the main source of air pollution is the consumption of fossil fuels , most of which comes from cars .
Albeit car manufacturers ' efforts to cut down the level of emission , there are limits in diminishing the emission .
Besides emitted gases , we are appalled at the noise from cars in the metropolitan downtown like Mahattan , New York .
The only solution to be pursued should be fewer cars on the road .

Second , cars are called gas guzzlers because they consume so much gasoline .
We are dependent on imported petroleum to run our cars .
The world is running out of petroleum in the not-so-far future .
We are at a critical time where we should curtail the use of cars .
There will be fewer cars if the oil prices skyrocket to the unbearable level .
Recently the prices went over more than 70 U.S. dollars a barrel .

Third , comparatively speaking , cars are not safer than other transportations , e.g. , buses , subways or trains .
We are seeing so many casualties , amputees and disadvantaged from car accidents .
Big mass transportations as safer movement tool bewteen places will be preferred if we have more convenient mass transportation system .

Fourth , governments and companies are making various efforts to alternative transportations .
For example , some companies are developing monorails , magnetic buyant trains and high-speed electric trains .
Monorails and the high-speed electric trains are already in operation between Seoul and Busan , Seoul and Gwangju in Kroea .

Finally , it will be inevitable to give up on cars and turn to inexpensive , efficient vehicles in the future .
Every one 's wise choice will save the Earth from dirty pollutants , free the country from dependency on imported oil , save many lives from tragic accidents and steer Korean toward more livable place .
