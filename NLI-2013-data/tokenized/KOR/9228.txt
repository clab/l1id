I agree the idea that more important thing for students is to understand ideas and concepts .
The first reason is that if the students can understand and follow the whole ideas or concepts of one thoery , it makes easilier to learn facts .
For example , imagine that you have to learn the history of the 1960 .
If you learn a lot of facts related to the 1960 .
In 1960 , there are enormous events and many detailed things you have to remember .
At first , you can remember the specific things what you think significant thing , but you forget most of facts you learned the next day .
However , if you study the whole structure of the history in 1960 and then add the detailed facts and organize well , you can remember facts easily than just learning facts without understanding concepts and even you can understand the flow of the history in 1960 without any extra affort .

Furthermore , if you understand the entire ideas and concepts , it helps you can solve the questions on your midterm or final exam .
Thus , it gives the opportunities to understand another historical facts .
Most of the facts have connection with each other .
For example , you already studied some historical facts in 1960 .
There are some facts which have relation with the other historical facts something like some events in 1980 .
If you know the entire concepts of 1960s history , you can learn additional facts related to another historical times .

The last reason , I agree the idea that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
is it is the true that you ca n't understand , learn and remember all of the facts what you need .
For instance , I have a test tomorrow and the test is for types of arts .
It means , I have to memorize lots of types of arts including realitism , romanticism .
If I did n't know the concepts of the romanticism , but I have to memorize the facts of the romanticism .
So I start to memorize everything in the art of remanticism including the pictures , history , artists .
Evenif I spend one week to prepare my test , I ca n't remember everything about romanticism .
There are a lot of facts in romanticism , and it is impossible to memorize or even understand without understanding the ideas and concepts .

The facts is small things in one theory .
If you want to draw and see the whole picture of one theory , you have to understand ideas and concepts before you learn the facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts is the most important and basic step to learn facts .
