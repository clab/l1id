Some people might think that it is more important for students to learn facts , while others think understanding ideas and concepts are more important .
In my opinion , however , knowing ideas and concepts are much valueable than just learning facts .
I agree with the statement for two reasons , if understood ideas and concepts , the student could use the theorys in other aspects when studying various happenings not only in their academic studies , but also in ordinary lives .
And the students might think more logically .

Firstly , understanding ideas and concepts will help the students about the related factors .
They can use the theorys they have learned in many areas .
For example , science knowledge can be happened in our real life .
In the kitchens , in the garage , in the play ground , and so on .
If the student have understood about some various theorys they can understand the happenings that they have seen .
Like Newtons theory ; the objects usually fall to the ground , easy scientif knowledge like , if ice melts it gets into liquid ...
etc .
And they can deal with it when emergency situation , too .

Secondly , just learning facts would interrupt students when thinking logically .
Students those who get used to memorizing facts will have a hard time when they have to solve logical problems .
For instance , especially to those who are in language major students are mostly get used to memorizing .
I heard that professor in Chinese language course warning to the students practice thinking logically , unless they will have hard time when they go into some companies .

To sum up , it is essential for students to get the ideas and concepts than just memorizing and learning facts .
So that the students can get knowledge which can be related to our ordinary life , and could think rationally .
That is why I agree with the statement .
