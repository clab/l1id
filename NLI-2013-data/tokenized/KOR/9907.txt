Succesful people try new things and take risks .
Most important of succesful people 's quilities are creative and activity .

Successful people always want to new thing and they are created .
For example , In the korea .
famouse musician Moon Jae Sook , she is traditional korea instument ( Gayagum ) player .
Acually Gayagum is old instrument and the songs are not any more popuation .
So , She was made of new song and she play .
also she play westurn class music by Gayagum .
People surprised the Gayagum 's new sound .

Now , Korea young traditional artist try make a new song .

Secondary , successful people are not only creative , but also they are activity .
They do n't want just thinkig .
If they got a idea , They make it reality .

Third , Successful people has good people .
Recently most of important is relationship .
Varity relation ships are helpful all situation .

So I agree that successful people try new things and take risk .
