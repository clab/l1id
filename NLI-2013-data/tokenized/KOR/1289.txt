We can think about many ways to study our academic subjects .
One way is to make one 's knowlege of several academic subjects broaden , and another one is to concentrate on specific subject .
I think the former ways are the better .
The reasons why I think so are as follows ;

First , modern society is very complex and difficult to understand by a narrow width of knowleges about a certain academic concern .
The aspect of technogical improvement and changed social environment force us to know things with more broaden and open sights .
For example new genetic technologies need us to study not only genetics but also chemistry , bioloy and so on .

Second , to have broad knolwege of many subjects can help us to view things more accuratetly .
If we know only some field and not know any other thing , then we cannot figure out what 's going on in our society .
If you do n't know economics because you do n't have interst in that field , you cannot undestand why national economy is less active .
Another example .
Some parents have difficulty in explaining some easy scientific phenomenons for their children , It may lead their childeren to lose their interst in science and they cannot know our surroundings .

Third , knowledges of a field can be linked to other fields ' knowledge ultimately .
Economy is related to polictics .
So we have to know and learn various things in academic fields .

Thus , I think we need to learn various fields
