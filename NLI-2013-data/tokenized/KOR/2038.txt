There have been a lot of events from the past in Korea : the Korean war , the invasion from Japan , many political incidents , and so on .
That 's why older generation has gone through roughly in Korea .
However , young generation has no problem living within our country these days without thinking of many problems older generation has had .
There are some evidences that why I think young people enjoy life more than older peole do .

In a trip field , it is kind of boom for many young people in Korea to go to Europe for their travel recently .
Not only Europe , but also many countries , such as the States , the U.K. , the southern Asia , Latin America .
The most important thing is that they go travelling by their money which is from their part-time job or their work .
Whereas , there is no doubt that older peole did n't used to go travelling abroad when they were younger .
It 's because they could n't afford travelling abroad at that time , which does n't mean that they did n't want to .
Besides , development for flying abroad was not enough for them at that time .
In other words , there were a few barriers for older people to travel abroad .

As the work as it concerned , while older people had to work 6 days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. , even more , young generation has `` working for 5 days a week from 9 to 5 '' these days .
Even they can take a rest on Friday for some jobs .
That 's the reason why they can enjoy life on the weekends .
They go shopping , go to a concert , go to a theatre , and go on a holiday .
As well as there are lots of entertainments that they can enjoy .

I would believe that many older peole enjoy life more than they used to these days .
