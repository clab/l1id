I think understanding ideas and concepts are more valuable for students than students learn the facts .
understanding concepts is very importan for students .
because the students understanding concepts mean they understand real important basic of what they need to learn .
so there are few reasons can support my statements .

First if students just learn about facts , sometimes they ca n't recognize what they do and what they learn .
because when they just understand about facts , they not learning for understanding , just for memorizing for test .
for example , when i study in class , if i am not understand the concepts , but i need to study for test , i just memorize whole chapter for test without understanding real main purpose for studying that chapter .
so when teachers teach the students , they should make sure students understand concepts and idea of lessons before they teach facts of lessons .

Second reason that learning concepts or ideas is more important for students is concepts of every learning contains the basic information of topic what they learn .
so they can learn step by step .
in the summerize , concepts and ideas is summerize of the topic .
so in the book , it is introduction .
when people reading book , they need to read introduction first .
so they can figure out how the story will play .

Last reason for statement is concept is main material of learning .
if the students just learn factors , they ca n't learn more detail .
if the concepts contrast to part of watermelon , concept is the red part of watermelon .
people usually cut water melon 's surfaces for eating inner of watermelon .
the facts can replaced by surfaces of watermelon .
so students should learn facts for concepts and ideas , not concepts for facts .

Therefore , more valuable for students that learning about concepts and ideas than students just learn about facts .
so they can understan main
