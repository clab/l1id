When I was studying in school , I also felt that `` Why we have to learn junk subjects '' .
However , I really agree about the many academic subjects are good for knowledge , because it provide lots of opportunities , I mean it 's good for future .

In my life , when I was second grade in middle school , a teacher gave a homework to us which was find your talant .
After school , I tried to think what am I good at or what do I like .
However , I could n't , because I could n't find my talants .
However , after highschool finally , I found my talants .
My talant is a law .
When I was first grade in highschool , I had a friend who called Che-Jea-Heong .
He was very special friend .
He always tried to think strange way .
First , I did n't want to talk with him , but when we talked about the talant , we became a friend .
Actually , his father is police .
And his family is very poor .
So , first we started to talk his father , why he is poor .
After that we started to think law .
Then we found our talant .
Actually , this I found this talant from the school project .
When I was 3grade in middle school , I had a class which was Korean language class , but at that class , we had a special study which was law .
Because , my teacher thought law is good for stundent .
So we tried to study the law just one period with a game .
However , my friends are really bored about this , but me I was really enjoyed that law class .
So after that period , I said to the teacher that study more laws , but she could n't , because lots of people did n't like that .
Anyway , I really like the law , also I 'll go to the law university .

From this reason , I can think many way to find my talant from the school subjects .
I can think math , science , music or art .
So we can include our opportunities .
Now days , many students cannot understand the school about the acadmic subjects that why they have to learn too much subject , I was too , but now I agree from the school .
And I really thanks from the school .
