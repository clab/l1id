In ancient korea , there was country called Cho-sun .
The king of Cho-sun , SeJong , said that knowledge gives people to live with a fortune , and hope .
But knowing many knowledge , but just half of it is worths nothing at all .

The world we live in now , information and speciallity became the most valuable item to get a job or success and get lots of money .
If a man who have broad knowledge of many academic subjuects , He sure will be having not much problem to live and he probably wo n't get stuck by some kind of problem .
But if its me ?
I would rather gamble my life to become the best not just middle .

Having a sepcific but deep knowledge about one subject .
It can be very dangerous thing .
He should worry about even he is specified about that knowledge , what happens if the world , the society thinks that that subject isnt that usefull and not important .
Because he is speicified to it , he could not be able to get a job leaving that subject .

But , Like this days he is specified in a subject that is so usefull in this world .
He will be welcomed by anyplace that he goes , and he will get lots of money and people would see and get to him closer .

What ever people chose , I think that a man or a woman should have faith on the subject that they like and want to know about .
And with out a doubt keep going on within that subject .
