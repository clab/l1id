People have their own ideas about whether traveling alone is better than traveling by a tour guide or not .
In my opinion , the best way to travel is by alone in that it can be free to tour places and easily make new firends in the new place .

First , traveling alone enbles us to feel free to move on tour site .
Some people may think that moving new places alone is dangerous because we do not know about the places .
In my opinion , However , traveling alone can benefit us to have more chances to see sight seeing .
For example , If I tour with other people on scheduled , I cannot see museums and churches that I wante to visit exept determined sites .
Then I do not feel satisfied with the tour .
In this way , I can say that traveling along give us more chances to visit than traveling in a group .

Second , when it comes to making new friends , moving alone greatly contributes to making it possible .
it is generally agreed that traveling in a group is difficult to make new people as they have to move scheduled the sighteeing sites .
However , when we are free we can meet other people that may be traveling people or local residents .
If they are residents , we can get more detail information on the place .
It will be more helpful to take a trip alone than traveling in a group led by a tour guide .

To sum up , Traveling alone is better way to treveling in a group by a tour guide in that we can have more chances to visit freely favorite places and meet new friends who can give useful information about the new places .
All things considered , I can definitely say that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way as the advanteges of traveling alone mentioned aboved .
