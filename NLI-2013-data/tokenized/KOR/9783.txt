In general , to be successful , many people takes risks .
But in my point of veiw , it is better to do what one really knows to become successful for two main reasons .
Low percentage of failing , and a better chance of developing the thing that one really knows well about .

First of all , if one take a risk on doing something , there is a high percentage of failing it .
By contrast , if you know what you are doing and work on it by researching and getting new imformations about it , although you might fail , it is more likely to succeed than doing what you do n't know by taking risks .

Second , if you do something that you have no idea what it is about , there is a low chance of being successful .
But a person who knows the subject that he or she is dealing with could use the knowledge they have to develope the old one they already know about to a better one .
For example , when I was11 , my science teacher at school told me to do an experiment about electricity .
At that time , I had know idea what it was about and had a lot of difficulty even choosing a topic for my experiment .
I eventually did poorly on the experiment .
But in the experiment I did next year was successful because I knew about the subject that I had to do a project with .

In conclusion , rather than taking risks , it is better to do things that you know about to increase the percentage of being successful and have a better chance to develope a new thing and become successful in life .
