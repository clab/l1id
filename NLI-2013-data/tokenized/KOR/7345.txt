I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Though I think that the choice should be made depending on each person 's individaul personanlity and preference , there are more disadvantages of taveling in a group than traveling alone .

For one thing , I believe that some people do not like being in a group .
For those people .
traveling in agroup will be very uncomfortable .
I have many friends who do not want to be in a group .
They may need more free time to relax and meditate by themselves .

Second , traveling group people cannot decide where to go or what to eat on their own .
They should cooperate with other members and somtimes they should give up their choices for the schedule of group .
I have an example from my own personal experience .
I was traveling in Italy in a group with a guide .
The guide asked which restaurant people wanted to enter for lunch .
Malority of people wanted to have Italian Pizza while I wanted to have stake .
I should have to give up stake becuase I was the only person who wanted it .
If I had traveled alone , this kind of thing would never have happend .

Third , moving in group cannot as fast and efficient as moving alone .
For example , people should wait until all the members get together and it is not easy to find space for many people in restaurant or theaters .
One of friends told me her terrible experienc of travel .
When she traveld China in a group , one of the members was lost in the Great Wall and all the other people wasted time finding the person and they gave up rest of schedule .

But I also admit that traveling in a group led by guide have some advantages .
For example , I do not have to study how to travel or what to prepare because the guide will do it for me .
I do not have to worry what if I am lost , either .
But more research on the traveling country will give me more sense of achievement after finishing traveling .

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide involves a lot of disadvantages , less free time , less options to chose and less efficiency of movement .
Though it can be more convenient to be led by a guide , one should sacrifice those things for convenience .
Lastly , I believe that completing traveling by oneself will give him or her more sense of achievement with more exposure to the country they travel .
So , I cannot agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
