It is reasonable that it can be helpful to travel in a group by a tour guide .
If we used a group tour giuide service to travel , we could easily connect with a way to travel .
However , I disagree this statement on the ground that to travel alone or with close persons is more meaningful to traveler .

Admittedly , to travel with tour guide is the way to travel easily .
A tour guide serves to assist traveler .
A tour guides have an effort to have an reservation about ticketing and traffics and they list somewhere travelers to go .
Also , tour guides know more about travel region than traveler .
They explain about the travel region professionally .
These facts reveal needs of a tour guide .

However , the virtue of travel is achieve the knowlege of a travel region by himself or herself .
The point of traveling is to achieve a character of the region and to understanding as well as to visit the region .
Also , if the travelers searched and got the information of travel region , the information would be remain very long time .
These informations will be helpful to live .

Besides , travelers without a tour guide have a choice to travel where and when they want .
They do n't need to visit region they do n't want and they can plan to follow their wanting by themselves .

On balance , tour guide in traveling is helpful to travel .
However , to travel without a tour guide has a great advantage .
To travel himself or herself make achieve informations about the traveling region and have a choise to travel .
Therefore to travel themselves is meaningful to travel .
