Looking at the television , newspapers , books , or even our own environment , we can easily view successful people who live a valuable and meaningful life .
Some may argue they merely did what they already knew how to do well .
However , two successful models , Tyra Banks and Ki-Man Lee , contradict the idea .

First , Tyra Banks took a new step to be a model when she could have just gone to the college she was already accepted .
When she was only seventeen years old , Tyra banks decided to take a new step : being a model .
She immediatley goes to Paris in France and looks for opportunities .
However , it was not easy as it sounds .
She lived in a small apartment , cramped with twenty other models , away from her family .
Everyday , in oder to get a job , she will go to twenty five agencies a day , and will be on time for every single one of them .
After all the hardship she went through , she finally had a contract with an agancy in Paris and started to begin her career .
Of course , she continued to try her best at every situation , and finally became known to the public after seveal years .
Now , she is one of the most noted , admired , and respected models in the world .
She is now viewed as a successfull model possessing intelligence and maturity .

Second , Ki-Man Lee took a new step of being a model when he was once a wrester who weighted 230 pounds .
As a young boy , Ki-Man Lee always dreamed of being a model .
But it was only a dream for him , since he was a professional wrester who was far from having a model body .
When he was 27 years old , however , he decides to achieve his goal .
At first , people derided him for even thinking about such a goal .
But no one could stop him .
By hard work , he lost 100 pounds and fled to Paris .
Like Tyra Banks , he visited numerous agencies and was eventually accepted .
He then expanded his career to be a runway model in the most noted fashion runway .
Now , he is a famous and successful model in France , where people admire him for his determination and ambition .

In short , Tyra Banks and Ki-Man Lee transfered from doing what they already know ho to do , to attempting new things .
This enabled both of them to be successful and respected models .
People are meant to be successful if they take risks and try new things because they have the courage and determination to take a new step .
