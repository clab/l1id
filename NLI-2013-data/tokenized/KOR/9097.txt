I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
There are several reasons to prove this opinion .

First , Students understand and learn easily about the subject if they know what ideas and concepts are .
For example , in math class , they are learning about the multiplication formula .
At the basic level , they only memorize the formula .
Four times four equals to sixteen .
This is not difficult , but in problem solving quetions , they need to think about the quetion what formula they are going to use .
At this point , they need the skill derived from the main concept and idea about the multiplying system .

Second , if they just learn the facts , they only need to memorize the facts that happened in a specific time range .
They cannot apply the fact into real life .
In real life , people confront many unexpected moments .
They should be wise to solve problems when they are in difficult situation .
However , if people only learn the facts , how can they solve other problems that they have never experienced ?
Therefore , people need to apply ideas and concepts that they have learned to the problems in real life .

Third , every subject is interacting each other .
For example , math and science are related subjects and social and history are related subjects .
People would not know how they are related and study well both subjects if they do n't know the concepts and ideas of each subject .

Everything that surrounds people in their lives are related and interacting each other .
People study subjects that are related our surroundings .
If they only know the facts , they cannot be improved and go ahead because they have only limited knowledge and skills .
To think broad and fix the problems , people have to know the real idea they have to achieve and the main concept of the subject .
