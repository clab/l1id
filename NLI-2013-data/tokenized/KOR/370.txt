There is a saying , `` Knowledge is one kind of power . ''
I agree with that phrase because you can use knowledge as much as you know .
Some people think it is more useful to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have specific knowledge that you know very well .
However , in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject which you are good at .

To begin with , they are so many people who have common knowledge .
Specifically , the knowledge they have are not unique or special .
Therefore , in this competitive society people would have to compete with each other for a job that anyone can apply .
It is not efficient to have knowledge that everybody knows .
Broad Knowlege of many academic subjects is not a merit .
For example , suppose there is a graduate who majored three subjects , History , Business , and Math .
He would know many things from learning all the contents of three majors and utilize all the subjects he learned .
Because there is limited time , it is hard to learn all the three subjects precisely and deeply .
He would only know the basics of each subject , not the advanced things .

In addition , focusing on one subject will make you as an expertise .
Other subjects that you do n't know well can be solved by an expert on that field .
It is more effective to take advice from him and ask questions that you are not clear with .
It is better to focus on the thing a person are good at so the experts can share their knowledge in an advanced way .
For example , people from different fields , can help each other by combining their own knowledge .
It is a win win game .

In conclusion , for these unavoidable reasons , I firmly believe people should develop and stick on to their own special knowledge .
