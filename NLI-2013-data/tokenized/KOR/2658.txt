Enjoying life seems like the priority goal of life to many human beings .
Going on vacations , dancing all night in a club , catering themselves with scrumptious food and expensive clothing all prove to the world that people do whatever they need to do to enjoy the life that they will never get to experience once again afer it is over .
Because age can be one of the factors that influence how much a person can enjoy life , among the economic class and moral values , the question of who enjoys life more comes out into the public very often .
I disagree with the statement of how young people enjoy life more than older people do because it is not only the age that effect how much a person can enjoy life .

Going to the hospital about 2 times a week was my routine for the last 17 years of my life .
I have been born with a disease that makes me easier to be vulnerable to common sicknesses such as colds and flus more than others .
I am 17 years old , the age which most consider as the age when one get to enjoy life the most .
However , by comparing myself to my mother who is 40 years old , I believe that my mother enjoys life more than someone younger like myself .
Instead of going to the doctors and hospitals every week , my mother spends time cooking , cleaning , and taking care of our family , which makes her the happiest in her life .
`` I enjoy my life the most when I get to make dinner for you and the family after a hard day of school and work '' is what my mother says to me all the time .
Also because she is such an optimistic person , rather a pessimistic one like myself due to the condition I was born with , she enjoys life like there is no tomorrow .

Not only does the personal characteristics that one is born with effect how much a person can enjoy life , the physical and the outter substance of a person definitely effect it .
Paris Hilton , the daughter of the owner of the Hilton Hotel company , is considered as one of the people who enjoys life to the fullest as proven through numerous megazines and articles .
Apart from her values towards life , one of the reason that she is able to enjoy her life to the fullest is the money she has .
The economic support from her family buys her the most expensive clothes and jewleries , makes her look like a supermodel every single day and also `` afford '' friends that a common person like myself would not be able to do .
Comparing Paris Hilton with a young teenager like myself proves that not all young people enjoy life more than older people do .

However it is also not the case that older people enjoy life more than young people since older people have experienced more hardships and faced obstacles throughout their lives .
There is no doubt that I do not go by a day without falling asleep feeling so blessed compared to some of the less fortunates .
I get to enjoy life , maybe not as much as my mother or Paris Hilton , but at least I have the privillege to enjoy life while some others do not .
Not only do young people do not enjoy life more than older people do , it is also not the older people that enjoy life more .
It is merely the age that effect one 's events in his or her storybook of life - it is one 's gifts and outlook towards life itself .
