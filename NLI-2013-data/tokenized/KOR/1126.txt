There are so many subjects which entices our concerning during study in university .
It is not a matter you 're bachelor or master or doctor .
The real essentical of academic subject , knowledge itself , is interesting and attracting for human .
But , I do n't agree with the assetion that we must boraden our knowledge better than specialize in on specific subjec .
I will give you a two reasons .

First , there is no such easy academic subject which can conquer in one or two decade .
Almost every academic subject needs one 's whole life 's efforts .
Most important thing to become a intellecture is concenturation in one specific subject not become a know-everything man .
Actually , human can not kwow whole things of the world .
For example , there is a person who I know .
He studies philosophy and he also eager to know lot of things about the non-philosophical things .
It is not a bad attutude I think .
But , He did n't get the degree in year what he plans to get that because of that eager distracted his concenturation .

Second , the society wants the person who has knowledge which is specialized in one specific subject .
If he knows lot of other knowledge , of course it is a good things .
But it is not a primary but secondary .
People who are talent in one specific subject can works as proffessional .
But the person who know many things but not specialized is not a proffessional .
For example , there was two friends of mine .
the one of them was talented in many things .
he was a good singer and good dancer .
He also studed well but not the best .
When he became a adult , he get a job .
But it was not a specialized job .
The another friends was talented in only school study .
But when he became adult , he got a job in a specialized area and he got a lot of salery .

To sum up , very essential respect of academic knowledge does n't allow multi-studying .
Because the ability of human is so limited , We must concentrate in one study .
And The society need proffesional person not a know-everthing man .
