I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
When I was a high school student , I usually learned just facts .
It was a system of korean education .
For example , in math class , I could learn a lot of information in short periord .
However , I usually got low grade each tests .
Because teacher changed style fo problems in each tests , I could not use such factors which I learned before .
That 's why I think to understand ideas and concepts is more important .

Next , if I understand ideas and concepts of problems , I can use them in our lives time .
For instance , I learned effective value of electronic products through my physics class .
Therefore , I can save utility fee because I can find which products are more effective than others in home .

Finally , if we know about concepts and idea of some accidents , unfortunate accidents would never happen in the future .
For example , if we just know factors of invation from other counties , the invations would be face again because we did not know how to prepare them .

Obviously , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
We can use ideas and concepts in our lives and prepare bad accidents .
