There are a lot of problems which the great amount of cars causes nowadays : traffic jam , pollution , etc .
Hopefully , some say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now .
Of course , there are others who maintain even after more than twenty years , cars are not going to decrease .
In my opinion , there will be fewer cars in twenty years in that due to rapidly growing technology , there will be some devices which are going to replace cars .

Firstly , as you know , there are many airplanes which produce less pollution than cars per person .
They become more and more comfortable to take and cheaper .
People are going to use flights rahter than taking their own cars sooner or later .
This will , at last , reduces the number of cars .

For the second thing , oil and gas which cars need to work , are decreasing in quantity .
Accordingly , they are really expensive now and never stop increasing .
Technologists and scientists , somehow , need to develop other vehicles which just need natural resources .
Those vehicles will replace cars and bring the earth back to the clean condition .

Above all , the goverments all over the world need to make a strict bill which eventually reduces cars to reduce pollution .
If they do n't , this world are going to be covered only by air pollution .
Following surveys done recently , it is said that many countries require their citizens to take public transportation , not their cars .

In summary , I believe people who use cars are going to decrease steadily for various reasons .
There will be great vehicles with making almost no pollution soon because people in the world including technology experts and scientists , are concerned about the pollution , and they are doing thier best to make better and cleaner vehicles .
As flights are getting cheaper , many people starts to use them instead of using cars .
