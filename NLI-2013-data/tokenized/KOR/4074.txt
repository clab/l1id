The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is wrong .
Just a week ago , there was an article in the newspaper talking about teenagers who won an award for helping in a local welfare house .
That was not the only article describing the works young people do for their surroundings .
Though not frequent , the reports of them helping the society come out countinuously .
The impression of not working enough for the communities could be because of : their preferance of visiting particular places to work , their tending to work seprately .

Firstly , young people cannot visit all the communities that exist in their society .
Although they spend considerable times helping , they could give the impression of not working enough because they do n't show up every where .
However , helping out every community would be impossible to youngsters , since there are places where they prefer to work .
For example , a public record showed most teenagers like to work at a library or local festival which need many volunteers but dislike going other places .
This is natural because people prefer places where their age is suitable .

Secondly , young people tend to work alone when helping the society .
Nowadays , because of people 's busy schedule , it is hard to find someone who would be willing to work together .
Since they are working as individuals , there could be a chance that they are unnoticed while working , and people could get the idea that young people are not working at all for the society .

Last , but not least , even if there are young people who do n't give enough time to helping their communities , they have to nowadays .
Major colleges that young people hope to attend , looks through the students ' record of their contribution to local communities .
There are points given out after working at a community , and the accumulated points are big part of their entrance to the young people 's ideal college .

In conclusion , young people do spend lots of time working for their communities .
Because they do n't visit many communities , and because most of the youngsters work alone to help the society , .
it could give impression of not giving enough help .
Also , since there is a new policy of point system in helping local communities , young people would have to spend time helping out them even if they do n't want to .
