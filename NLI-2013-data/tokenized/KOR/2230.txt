Since the younger people have more energy , some may argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Personally , I disagree with the statement .
I belive that the older people have better understanding of life and therefore are capable to enjoy their life more .

First , as people get older they experience different situations and learn various things .
Older people tend to know more about how life works and be capable of accepting things as they are .
Younger people , on the other hand , tend to complain about their lives more .
They are always dissatisfied with their lives and things happening around them .
They spend more time on questioning and complaining about things than on accepting things and moving on .

Older people , having experienced in different situation , can look at things more objectively and move on faster .
Second , younger people spend more time on different things such as studying and working than the older people .
Young people are often too busy trying to achieve what they want to take a closer look at their life and understand what they really need for their lives .

In the novel , Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom , for expample , Morrie , the old professor who was dying , tells the reader how young people tend to waste their time trying to earn more money when what they really need is each other .
As people get older , they learn the valuable things in their lives and tend to enjoy theri life more than the younger ones who are often stressed out about their jobs or status .

Finally , one may argue that young people often are capable of spending their time and engergy on doing something wild and therefore can enjoy their life more .
Who says doing something wild is the only way to enjoy one 's life ?
Sitting around at home and having a relaxing converstion with some friends could be more enjoyable than trying to jump off a bridge with a rope attached to oneself .
