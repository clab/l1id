The statement asserts that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , I completely disagree with the statements for several reasons .

First of all , There are no substitution for cars .
Today , there are a lot of public transportation like buses , subways and monorails .
However , it does not reduces a number of cars these days .
In fact , a number of cars are increasing rapidly these days .
People uses their cars for personal reasons like shopping and moving their luggages .
Taxies might substitue this purpose however it costs a lot .
No one want to use the taxies for personal usage because it 's cost .
In my opinion , nothing can substitute need for personal cars .

Second , there are many countries in Africa and all over the world .
They do n't eat food well .
Furthermore , they do n't even think about cars .
However , in twenty years , many contries which are in poverty and danger now will be developed .
Individuals in developed contries might want to have their own car .
It will increase a number of cars in twenty years .

Third , car mania 's are increasing now a days .
They want to have more than two cars to show off .
Someone have 5 cars by it 's makers like BMW , LEXUS , HONDA , HYUNDAI , FORD .
In fact , in China , there are more makers we do n't know .
It will grow rapidly and many car manias might want to have more cars .

Finally , the population of world are increasing .
As the population of world is growing need for car will be growing .
When new babies become a high school student in twenty years , they need to buy cars for moving or go to school or for socail activities .
Someone might buy cars more than one like car manias .
In my view , growing population also imply growing a number of cars .

In sum , I fully disagree with the statement .
Because there are no substitution for cars , developing countries will need for personal cars , and car mania 's will increase too and people who want cars will increase .
For those reasons , I strongly oppose to the statement .
