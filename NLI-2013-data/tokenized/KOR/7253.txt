Hana tour , Uri tour ...
They are the platcard that we can see easily around us .
You will think go to to travel in goup led by a tour guide looks great idea .
But what I want to say here is that method is not a best way .
Best wayto travel is go to trip not with a tourguide .
That cause more fun and give you unforgartable memories .

Do you actually think go trip with guide is fun ?
The answer is No .
If you travel with out tour guide , then you can go to anywhere you want .
With tourguide , you have to follow the skedule , and be more careful to your behabiors not to behave badly to others .
And the worst thing is that tour guide even instruct the time of resting .
Like `` 10 minute ! '' or `` 1hour ! ''
.
We ca n't rest enough or do what ever we want with a tourguide .
Maybe we will learn more and get some extra-knowledge but remember that we can know it easily from books or other source like computer or TV .

It 's sure that you will get charming memories by traveling with out tourguide .
With tour guide , you have to do what he or her instructed .
It 's right that there are low percentage of accident like losting , when you go trip with tour guide , but think diffrently , It can be a one source of experiences .
An accident , meeting ...
In my cases , when I was traveling with my family , not a tourguide , we made a friends in the who live in other country .
I still communicate with them nowadays too .
They helped me a lot in many things .
But when I travel with tourguide , I do n't enjoy trip much .
Lie down on the snow for long time is lomantic things , but you ca n't even dream it with tourguide .
You will also feel bad or tired , but long times later , that memory will be unforgatable in you mind , that can tell to the other people you know .

Having fun and precious memories is really needs in traveling .
With out tourguide , sometime even annoying , you can enjoy the real point of trip .
Peoples , let 's packed the bag and go to trip where we can refresh ourselves !
