There is many kinds of people in this world .
also there is a lot of people who had successful with something .
some people believe that they good at and always .
try to do something that they already know very well .
I believe that the people who succeed in the society must be willng to try something new and take risk rather than only doing what they knoe well .
But , In my opinion , successful people should do only that thing they already know how to do .
Beacuse if you try to do something new things you may will have hard time to come back to that thing you could do it beafore .

For example , Let 's say your jop is a `` Successful dentist '' .
But , one day you learned how to play golf .
Since than you got too much in to the playing golf and you deside to be pro-golfer .
May be you will be amazing pro golfer .
but there only little chance to be like that I think .

Beacuse you spend allmost every time to be a dentist in your lifetime .
