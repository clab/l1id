Throughout the centuries there have been many talks on what kind of education would be best for students .
Is it more important to help students understand ideas and concepts of what they 're learning , or is it more important to help students learn the facts ?
Different countries have come up with different solutions to these questions , and as a person who studied under both types of education system , I will say that I personally believe it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

From my personal experience of studying under the Korean education system for a year and from hearing my peers ' first-hand experiences , I say that Korean education is more concerned on teaching facts rather than ideas and concepts to students .
Students memorize facts and statistics , line after line , without even understanding the meaning of what they are learning .
This has a harmful effect in a long run because after examination is over , students will no longer remember what they learned .

On the contrast , if students come to understand ideas and concepts of what they are learning , the knowledge has become their own and will stay in them for long term .
For instance , when I was little , I hated science because I had to memorize numerous formulas and facts that I did not understand .
However , under new American science teacher I began to thrive in science as he taught me the basic ideas and concepts of science .
As I understood what I learned and digested it as my own , I came to appreciate science more .

In conclusion , although both types of educaton is necessary and students need to understand and learn both ideas/concepts and facts , I think it is more important for students to understand facts and concepts first because it will be much easier to learn the facts after understanding the concept .
