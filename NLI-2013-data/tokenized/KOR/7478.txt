Yes , I do agree with this state ment .
because if we have group , we can help each other , and we will have great time and more easy way to travel .
and the reason to have tourguide is the tour guide knows , how to travel and what place is more nice and safety ...
exemple .
What will happen if we lost our way ?????
ofcourse the guide will help .
and what will happen if one of our member is sick ??
ofcurse the guide will bring him to the doctor ...
That is why i like this statement .

THANK YOU ^ ^
