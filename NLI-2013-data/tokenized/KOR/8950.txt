Sometimes , there are several argues how to teach students , and what is the ultimate goal of the education .
And as the creativity of a student is getting important , understanding ideas and concepts is more emphasized than just recieving facts .

There are some students who are good at memorizing and get high marks in school examinations .
Actually , this kind of studying could be a way .
However , in most cases , these students are not recognizing what those really are , and why they are lerning those .
This question would make the student be confused and it is easy for them to give up studying one day .
Also , even if they finished their academic work , they can not ` create ' anything because they have never tried creating , but accepting everything somebody obtained .

This era is could be represented by the word , ` creativity ' .
As the deposit of acknowledge is too tremendous for one person 's brain capacity and because of the computer , our past job , which was just accepting knowledge , was substituted by the computer .
Therefore , it is not the issue to copy and paste informations .
The role of people in these days is ` reproducing ' from past informations .
And only a person who really understand someting can reproduce , and creat something new from it .

Some people criticize that in some histrical , political , or other some cases which are controversial , making them understand could mean kind of brainwashing .
However , just knowing the fact without any standard or way to evaluate them would cause the student confused .
So teachers must teach them many viewpoints and opinions of several people , and then let them make their own idea and evaluate the situation .

Before the invention of the conputer , people could be regarded as intelligent people with numerous just memorized facts .
However , these person , in nowadays , is nothing more than a memory card of computer , What they should do is how to use given information properly , and make a new and better one than before .
