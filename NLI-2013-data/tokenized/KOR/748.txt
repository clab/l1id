Some people believe that braod knowledge of various academic subjects is more important than a special skill in one specific subject .
In contrast , others think that specialized skill in a certain subject is much more profitable , because one can become the best in that certain field .
I personally support the former idea , because having broader knowledge of diverse subjects indicates that this could be applied more often in reality and bring advantages when deciding one 's career .

Firstly , by having diverse knowledge of various academic subjects , I can find out in which subject my talent lies .
For example , one can attend numerous classes , such as mathematics , psychology , geography , biology and other .
However , the person can find out that he/she is only talented in subjects like calculous and science but is terrible in biology and history classes .
Thus , the person can find out where his/her talent is and be able to make clear and benefitial decision for his/her future career .
Not to mention that being knowledged in various fields , one is not restricted in one area when deciding his career or talent .

Moreover , people can apply their various skills in numbers of areas .
Reason being , if a person is only specialized in one area , he cannot contribute to other fields of work .
However , being knowledgeable in diverse areas , even when he/she faces challenging situation , the person can easilly apply his knowledge and therefore ameliorate the situaltion .
Additionally , when someone is in dire need of help , the person with broad knowledge can use his surviving skills to rescue the person .
In fact , knowledgeable in only one specific subject , often one cannot be well informed about what he/she must do when the person face emergency .

In conclusion , even though being specialized in one specific subject is also benefitial , I believe that having broad knowledge of numerous areas is much more practical and advantageous .
This is largely because , people can find out their true talent and more often apply those knowledge in reality .
