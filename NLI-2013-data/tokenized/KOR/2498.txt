It is often said that older people enjoy life more because they have more money and time to buy something or travel .
However , I do not agree with that older people enjoy their lives more than younger people .
There are several reasons and examples that young people enjoy life more .

To begin with , young people have much better physical condition .
They can go wherever they want and do whatever they want .
For example , my uncle , who was over 60 , really wanted to try bunge-jump at least one time .
But he was too old to do that kind of risky outdoor sports .
He regreted that he could enjoy his life more than now if he were young .

Secondly , young people have more desire about their lives than older people .
I believe that dream is a essential factor to feel happiness in their lives .
As people age , they tend to lose their dreams because the possibility decreases to fulfill their dreams or goals of life .
It often leads to frustration and abandonce about their lives .
For instance , a lot of parents in Korea sacrifice themselves much for their kids .
They have little hope besides their kids .
It is almost impossible for them to work more , make more money , or make new friends .

In addition , young people can feel happy in thier lives from even small satisfaction .
There was one TV program how each generation react to some given events .
They were more likely to smile and laugh than older people .
They felt happy very easily just because they were more happier people .
Very small comedy or even trivial action was able to satisfy young people and make them laugh .
It shows that young poeple can enjoy almost everything in all situations , in contrast , older people are picky .

In short , I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people have better reasons and conditions to enjoy life more .
They have enough both physical and mental energy to try what they want to .
And their desire will encourage them to explore and enjoy their lives vigorously .
Also they have more tendency of satisfation .
