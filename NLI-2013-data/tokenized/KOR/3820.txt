Nowadays , many people believe that young people are very selfish and they do n't do anything for their community .
But , I disagree with this kind of opinion .
From long time ago , people have complaint about younger than them .
However , nowadays youger people volunteer in many fields for their community and they study very hard .

First of all , we can find many young students to volunteer in many place .
Of couse , some school need some volunteer job for their credit .
Even though , there are many students to do it just for helping their community .
For example , we can see many young poeple to voluteer in the orphanage or hospital or school .
They can be very helpful in this kind of place .
Because , in the hospital or orphanage house , there many peoples to desire the help .
But the supply is very lack compare to the demand .
The young people compensate the gap .
How appreciatable thing it is .

Futhermore , many young people study hard and work for thier future and their community Actually healthy minded young people can be very important resorces for their community .
They take responsible the future of their society and the results , it can the most helpful thing for society .
For example , if young people reglect their duty in the society , it can be very miserable thing for the community .
Because they are our future by themselves .
Fortunetly , most young people take their responsibility , it can naturally predict the positive future .

To sum up , many students give enough time to helping their society by voluteering and studying or working .
As I considered , our communitie 's future is very bright because of appreciatable young people .
I think that we should encourage the healthy-minded young people to go on the positive way not to blame them .
