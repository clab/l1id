In my opinion trying new things that you never did before is the apportunity to have more chance to succeed .
Because people would know what they are good at by trying .
It is very important to know what you can do well and also you can enjoy As an example , I used to play the piano when I was young .
And I always thought that I was good at playing piano and it would be my career in the future .
But as I grew up , I experienced that I lost the interest and the joy from playing the piano .
After that , I started to learn playing the violin for a year .
But it was only interesting at first several months .
Then I started to take an art class in school .
I used to draw and paint when I was young , but this time I felt the passion and joy from it .
Now I look forward to attend in art school .
The several art awards that I received are always making me to think learning new things are so important .

Although I already decided to study more about art and work in art industry , I try to learn new things to improve myself and for my future .
I learnd Tae Kwon DO two years ago and I try to meet as many people as I can from volunteer works to understand different kind of people and their cultures .
Also I joined many clubs in school that I want to do .

I think successful people try and learn new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It is like to explore yourself what you are capable of .
Also I believe that the trying many things will become your valuble experiences and knowledges to make you successful and it will be also very helpful for your life .
