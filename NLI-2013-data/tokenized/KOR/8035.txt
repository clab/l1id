People say that we prefer to learn facts in the our life .
some people also say that learning something without understanding ideas and concepts of the materials are dangerous in the their fields .

In my opinion , I think that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts At first , when I was high school , I had to experience to learn my science subject without understanding concepts coming my test .
As the result , I was not taken score that I wanted because I had to memorised the subject on purpose such like another students studing their test .
However my friend named Mathuda had to study his subject in keeping understand the test .
in addition if he was not understand any more about science , he tried to struggle to understand the science of the concept .
so he won the prize of test .

understanding the concept contributies students to konw in the fields more detail .
It offers our to have imaginage in our life .
It means more effective than learn facts because we need to develop strong skill of our subject in our life .
Having understand ideas is to establishes to expand our field more .
In this manner .
I prefer to study understanding ideas and concepts .
In conclusion , I agree with above statement .
