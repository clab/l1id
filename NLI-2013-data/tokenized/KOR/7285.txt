Over generations , the way people want to travel has changed .
In the past , people wanted to visit as many places as they can in a period of time .
Nowadays , people want to make much memories with travelling members , instead of hurring in a fixed minutes .
To make much memories with close friends or family , the best way to travel is to plan by themselves and take their enough time to look around .

Going on a trip by themselves , instead of a big group , gives them enough , and even plenty of time to look around .
Often , touring with a group with a tour guide makes tourists in hurry and out of time , because they have a fixed schedule to follow and the group to stick with .
These make them nervous about being in time while touring and take away comforts in their mind ; however , travelling by themselves does n't have strict time limits to follow , and therefore they can take as much time as they want without hurrying .

Also , having more times ables travelling members to make more memories .
The aims of a touring with a group are to visit as many places as they can and to get knowledge about places they visit in a fixed time .
On the other hands , travelling with with their own members ables themselves to make more memories of the travel taking pictures , having a cup of tea , looking around shops , and so on .

Thesedays , people plan for travels in order to be out of everyday 's business , to feel comforts and to spend time with their friends or families ; however , if they tour in a group led by a tour guide , they will not be able to achieve what they expect for the travels ; therefore , the best way to travel being absence of hurriness is to travel by themselves instead of put themselves in a tour group .
