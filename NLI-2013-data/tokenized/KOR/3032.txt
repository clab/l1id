Most people would like to enjoy their own life .
In a modern society , the old are limited to do activities rather than the young .
For example , most things change to technological like using computers or machines .
These are not familiar to the old .
As a result , young people enjoy life more than the older in a community .

First of all , the young have more opportunities to spend their time anywhere or anytime .
Most buildings or systems are benefit to the young , because the young know how to use .
For instance , in a downtown of big cities , there are many familiar places like shopping malls , restaurant or music rooms for the young .
Also , most things are used to computer systems , so it is much easier to the young than the old .
