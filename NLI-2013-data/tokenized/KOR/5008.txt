There are so many advertisement in the TV , newspaters , and magazines .
The purpose of the advertisement is the increse of the sales .
Maybe it works very well , for the advertisements still exist even though the cost of advertisement is so expensive .
I agree with the statement that the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .

I can easily find the example that the advertisement works well .
My mother has good conditioned refrigerator .
There are no problem to preserve the food or to freeze the ice , but after she watched repeatedly the advertisement which explains the new and good funciton of the refrigerator during the TV drama , she considers whether to change the refrigerator to new model or not .
I think the real funciton of the new refrigerators is not different from the old one we have .
However , advertisement makes her think the new refrigerator have better function and buy it .

Second , advertisment also provide people the illusion by showing that the famouse people use the product .
Famouse person like actors and sports star use the product and persuade the people to use the product in the advertisement .
This type of advertisement make the image that the product is good because famous person use the product .
The advertisement misleads someone to buy the prodcut even though the quality of the product is not good .

In conclusion , the advertisments make people to buy product more if the advertisement does not exist .
The advertisement give the information of the product , but because the purpose of the advertisement is not only giving the information but also persuading the people to buy the product , thd advertisements definitely exaggerate the quality of the product and makes the some image that differ from the real product .
