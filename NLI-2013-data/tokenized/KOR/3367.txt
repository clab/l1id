Thesedays , it is really tough to give time to help our communities .
Most young people are busy to have fun by themselves or to get ready for their future .
Did you have enough time to help your community ?
Let me tell you how young people 's mind became evil .

First , young people in Korea love to get drunk .
I saw Korean Times last week , and it said `` More than 77 percents of Korean University students are near alcoholics '' .
I do not think the `` near alcoholics '' have the time to help their communities .

Second , other young people in Korea are really busy to get ready for their future .
They try their best to get all kind of licenses like MBA , GPA .
It is really hard to get a job in Korea nowadays .
That is why young people get ready for their future .

Third , young people hate to help their communities , because they think it is bored and not necceary .
Their parants should tell them to help their communities .
Last , it is really bad for their future if they do not give enough time to help their communities .
It will make them to be phycos .
If they are not used to be in communities , they will be selfish , mean , and evil .

I saw a person who helped his commnunity when he was young , he did almost perfect control with time .
He never got drunk , got many licenses , helped his community .
He is enjoying his life now .
I am telling you that all young people should give enough time to help their communities .
