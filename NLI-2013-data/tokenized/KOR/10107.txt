I agree to the statement .
If you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make changes and reach the top ?

Of course , being successful means different to everyone .
For me , being successful means being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in .
A successful businessman is one of the most influential leaders in the field of managing and administrating an enterprise .
A successful pianist is one of the most revered musicians and plays the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others .

For instance , Hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four fingers , is now a successful pianist in Korea .
Her performance may not be as good as Mozart ; but the thing is , despite the harsh circumstance , she became one of the prospective pianists in Korea .
She would not have gained the fame and recognition , had she given up and blamed the situation .

The potential to succeed is not born with ; it 's all about grabbing as many opportunities as one can and doing things that usual people do not even think about .
