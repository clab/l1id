I strongly agree opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Some people say this society have lots of young people who help our communities and show some example of article of newspaper written about young people who help community , but I think they are particular young people .
Most young people does not pay their time to help their communities .
It is real of nowadays .

Lots of young people is personalized people nowdays .
They do not think ablout others situation .
The only thing they focused is their own problem .
Moreover , young people nowadays does not like activity or performance , rather like staying in home .
In home , they play computer game or video game .
Even they communicate their friend on line not off-line .
For example , they chatting and doing group homework by messenger program in computer .
It is natural that these toung boy does not like helping their communites .
Helping communities need lots of activity .

Studing harder than past is one reason , too .
Young people in past are not depressed by study .
But nowadays , study is prior things to young people .
Oil price is raise and long-term depression in economy is exist so young people concern about their future naturally .
So , they cannot afford to give enough time to helping their communities .

It is another reason that old people do not struggle to make yong people to help their communities .
In past , old people is good role model to young people .
But sociey are more developing and lots of people live in city , old people also no more give enough time to helping their communities .
Roughly speaking , the problem that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is making old people who has not helping their communities .

In these reason , I purport that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Young people acknowlege that development of community is develvopment of own quality of life .
We need young people who help our community .
