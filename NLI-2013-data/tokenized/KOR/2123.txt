I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I do not think it is true because there are many reasons i think that older people enjoy their life more .

The first reason why i do not disagree that statement is that It is depends on what is personalty the people have .
there are young people who does not really like to do something and just be alone .
I do not think they are really enjoying theirn life .
On the other hand , there are some old people who really like to go out and hang out with their friends .
my host mother is an example of old person who enjoys her life even more than me. she is in her 60s now and she loves to go out with her friends and go shopping .
when she doen not have work to do she always make a appoinment with her friends to do something .
she never like to be home all day doing nothing .

The second reason is that there are lots of things that allow old people do but not for young people .
generally old people has more time and money than young people have .
young people have to study if they are still in school .
and they get certain money from their parents so they do not really have lots of money to go out all the time .
for example , my mom and dad love to travel other countries with their friends and they do have money to afford it .
Of course I want to travel with my friends too but i do not have money for it .

In conclusion , I do not think the statement is right .
enjoying the life is depends on how the person 's personality is like .
And there are a lot of things that allows only old people do .
