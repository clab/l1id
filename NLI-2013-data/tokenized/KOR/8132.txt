Sometimes , what people believe to be a fact turns out to be wrong , and many people are astonished by it ; however , their notions toward the fact are less likely to be changed .
It is because their minds are already hardened to accept the new information .
Therefore , what people must learn is the concepts and ideas of the fact , not just the fact itself ; since it offers them more flexible mind , the ability to accept the foreign ideas to them , and a broad perspective .
History itself asserts the power of the ideas and concepts .
For example , the fact that the sea water does not freeze is proved wrong by Napoleon .
In most cases , it does not freeze , yet there was a historical event that showed the exact opposite .
Napoleon was the figure who knew the power of ideas and concepts : he broke the dam to invade Netherland ; the breakage of the dam created a very sound lake made by the sea water ; and when the winter came , the lake froze .
The army of Napoleon could invade Netherland easily .
Therefore , it is more important to know the concepts and ideas to apply in real world than to know a single fact .

Also , the students are likely to have more flexibility when they understand the ideas and concepts , since they can apply their knowledge to a variouds range of studies .
For example , a person knows about the way earth moves during the earthquake , then he can adapt that knowledge to construction in order to build a earthquake-resistence building .
It is important to point out that it is not his ability to know as many informations as possible ( knowing facts ) but it is his knowledge and understanding of a certain matter , in other word , understanding ideas and concepts .

In conclusion , it is much more beneficial to understand
