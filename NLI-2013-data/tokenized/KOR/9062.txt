In my oppinion , these both suggestions : understanding ideas and concepts , and learn from facts .
Because these both teaches people a idea about common sense in the world .
and some of the common sense or common knowledge ca n't be learned by own experience .

For example , people often learn better behavior in their life through the religion .
because some of the ideas that religion teaches people cannot be figured out by one 's own wisdom .
and for the improvement of their life and spiritual health , people often willing to learn more about their religions .

Besides this reason , a lot of those beliefs , ideas that had been found by mankind in the history , Always had begun from the curiosity about somebody else 's idea .
For example , the famous scientist Galileo could prove the truth , ' the earth is spining around the sun ' , indirectly by the idea based on Roman catholic ; which he argued to .
his conclusion about universe came from his own experience about the fact .
but if he could n't understand the concept of the universe and ideas which people before Galileo believed , he could n't take any chance to make arguement .

Just like the exemples showing above , to learn something from fact , we basically need to have some basic knowledge which had already been set by somebody else .
Through the history , The idea and peoples ' creativity has been growing upon another .
that shows the important conclusion ; people learn from the idea before they prove the truth by their own fact .
Along with this fact , we are living in the world that requires the proof ; we have to prove things that we have learned .
if we know only the knowledge which learned from fact and we ca n't prove it .
Then our knowledge become just one 's stereotypical method with our any reasons in the public .
therefore , if we do not understand the idea and concepts which is generally proved as truth by somebody .
We ca n't expect our fact that learned from experience to be general truth .

In conclusion , to learn or to prove new things learned from our life we have to know about old concepts too .
