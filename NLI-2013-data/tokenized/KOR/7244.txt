Some people like to travel alone , while others want to go travel with a guide .
Each has sevral pros and cons .
However , I believe to enjoy traveling safe and effective , one should travel with a group of people led by a tour guide .
That ' because it is safer and a tour guide knows well about certain regions .

First of all , traveling with a companion is much safer .
No one denies that there are bobberies or dangerous accidents in famous spots .
If a person faces a problems when going travel alone , it is greatly hard to solve it .
However , with a group of people with a guide , one is likely to overcome angerous situations , because a tour guide may be aware of some difficulties in the country .
For example , I went to a Jeju island a yeas ago with my family .
We had hard time to see a doctor because my sister got food poisoning .
At that time we could cope with problems thanks to the guide 's aid .
If it were not for her help , my sister would have sicked during whole vacation period .
We never forget her kindness and after that we become to go trip with a guide whenever traveling .

On top of that , we can travel as many places as long as we are not tired .
Since tour guides are a professional of their region , they can recommand which places are good to see and which market sell product more cheap .
These abilities help travelers to enjoy fully their vacation .
To be specific , I went to East Europe with a group of people , and we could go where we had looked forward to visit .
That 's because we notices this to a guide and guide made a perfect schedule .
As a result , that travel is the best trip in my life .

In addition , one can make friends with the help of a tour guide .
Most of tour guids are living where they are reponsibla to show and explain .
Therefore , they know many people living there .
We have chance to meet indigenous people with a guide , This gives great pleasure to foreigners .

Of course , there are some negative aspects when traveling with a guide .
However , positive effects are much more .
In conclusion , I believe that traveling with a guide with a group of people is the best way to enjoy one 's vacation .
If I have a chance to on a trip , I would go abroad with a group which is led by a tour guide .
