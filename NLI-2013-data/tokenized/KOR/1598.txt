It has been a controversial issue whether some people think to specialize in one specific subject is more effctive on developmence of student .

in my case , in elementsry school , i learnd about math english , arts , music , but after , exam i thought i lterested in music and arts .

when i was a little child , i spent whole day drawing a picture .
i did not know why i spent a lot of time even do not eating .
after graduated from middle school i went Arts high school and also i graduated from Arts university .
that is becaue i could found which subject like it and what i boring the subject .

Last but not least , it helps development of knowledge .
if student study one specific subject during the childhood .

after 5years , when he was in Korea he can not speak Korean .

althought he is Korean .

In conclusion , i think that to have broad kowledge of many academic subject is
