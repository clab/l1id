Nowadays , people cannot only get very much information on television or newspapers or magazines and also subway even more on streets .
i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are several reasons are first .

i have seen many people who buy some products on internet shopping mall often return products , second , it is broken easily .
I saw many times that some people returned products .
It is usually sell on internet shopping mall and home shopping .
For example , i have experience .
In Korea , home shopping is general .

I saw the program to sell gelly shoes .
It showed very cute and pretty .
But it delivered to me , i was disappointed because it was different when I was seeing .
So i had to return it .
Somtimes , many people are attrated good models who are advertise special products .
People cannot bear for temptation .
All advertisements are not lie .
Just a few products show much better than real products .
