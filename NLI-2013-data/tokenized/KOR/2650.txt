People usually say that young people are the future of our socieies .
It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of lives and their futures .
In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want .
Moreover , young people are usually very healthy to do something hard thing that they face on .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more that older people do .

Firstly , older people have less time to consider and already experienced many things that can enjoy their lives .
Young people are literally ` young ' , so they have lots of time to think about their lives .
Also they have much more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people .
For example , young people have a lot of dreams in their futures , so they are always consider what they really want to be .
Therefore , they spend a lot of time to learn new things that they have never experienced , but older people already experienced most of things in their lives so not a lot of things are left for them .
In addtion , young people have enthusiasm to try new and hard things which can definitly enjoy their lives .
Although things are hard and difficult have have youth passion to figure out but old people are not really facinated in difficult and dangerous fields .

Secondly , older people are not often healtier than young people .
For instance , older people can not run as fast as young people .
Therefore , although older people want to hike Rocky Mountain , they can afford to hike as much as they want .
On the other hand , young people are very healthy to try whatever they want , even though things are very difficult and dangerous .
In addition , although they get injured , their bodies are easily get better than older people .

In conclusion , young people have much more time to enjoy their lives such as thinking about their future , learning new skills and experiencing new things .
Moreover they are heathy to enjoy these new experiences and skills than older people .
Therefore , young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .
