I agreed about that statement because of two reasons .

At first , I think the number of cars will be reduced in the future because of lack of fuel .
Nowadays , the fuel we used to operate cars has showed the bottom .
I think it will be disable to use in the near future , so we will have to find altinative things .
Another transpertation can be appeared or people can use more public transpertations than cars .
We could n't expect what will be the solution to solve lack of fuel , but expect the nember of car is reduced .

The second reason that I think is that cars can be products based on trend like other products .
When l went to Seatle , l saw an interesting sentence on a woman 's T-shirts , it was saying `` Computer is a Trend '' It looks like non-making-sence thing , but l thought it was possible .
Like computers , cars also a products making by a factory and following trend .
The color , shape , brend people prefered are always changed by the year 's trend .
It 's possible that people do n't want to have car anymore and prefer another more awesome products .

for these two reason
