Success people can be defined as people who have much knowledge and have good propectives of behavior .
To be successful people , I believe that peole have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In that way , people can have more experience as they try new things and also people can try their best all the timeas as they take risks .

Successful people challenge new things to get own experience .
If a person challenges new field , he or she will experience a new thing .
Thus , he or she will have more knowledge about the field .
I , for example , am trying Toefl test for the firt time and it is sure challenging me and pressing me .
However , since I experience the test for now , I guess I could do better for the next time .
It is becasue I challenge the new thing , Toefl thest , and have more knowledge than before .

As taking risks , people can have good prospectives of behavior while they are trying their best .
When people are taking risks , they have to be careful as possible as they can and also try their best to acheive their goals or not to fail .
Even though people fail , they will try their best not to make the same mistake like before .
For instance , if a student gets wrong on the test .
On the next test , the student will learn something from what he or she got wrong and will correct later .

As people challenge new field and take risks , they can have much knowledge and good personality , which mean they can success for the rest of their life .
If people only do what they already know how to do well , then it will make them not learn anymore , and cause them to think they are the best .
Therefore , I stronly recommend people to try new things and take risks to live better quality of life .
