There are some people who likes to go with tour guides in a big group when they travel overseas and even in domestic tour .
It is not the case for me .
I like travel by my self .
There are three reasons why I like travel by myself and I disagree with the statement above , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because it would be impossible in groups to go places that I want , delay the flight , and not buying lots of suveniors .

First , It will be impossible to drop by the places that I wanted to go .
If I go in a tour guided groups , group ca n't go wherever I want to go but where people in group agreed to go .
It is impossible to get out of tour guide ' itinerary too because of the safety reasons what they call .
For example , I will be really sad not dropping by at the most famous cholate store in San Francisco when other might think it is waste of time .

Second , It is impossible to delay my flight .
Groups move by itineraries that have assigned long before by tour companies .
The tour guide would want to go as many places as they think in a short time .
What if I want to stay in tour area for a while for a nice , bronze tan i wanted to get in France ?
What If I fall in love which hot italian guy who is really good at kissing ?
I would want to delay my flight for a week or so .
Is that possible for touring in goup ?
No way .
Some people might say , `` i miss Korea , I want Kimchi ! '' when others do n't .

Third , tour guides tend to take tour groups to tons of suvenior shop .
Just like leashing dog off from owner , tour guides spares many hours in suvenior shop thinking that people might want to buy lot 's of them and take it home .
I do n't go traveling to buy suveniors .
It would be wasting of time , spending three hours in duty free shop .

In conclusion , traveling in group is not attractive to me because , if i go traveling , I want to spare more time knowing and leaning the place that i go by willing to spare more time and efforts on trying to know what I want .
So , it is not the best idea to travel in group led by a tour guide .
