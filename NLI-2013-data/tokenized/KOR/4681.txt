The main purpose of the advertisement is not only make customers to understand products but also make products look nicer and better .
Thus , I totally agree with the following statement .
All people would have experienced the power of the advertisement a lot of times .
I have a few examples to support my idea .

When I go to the mall , I see the new products each time .
One of them is cell phone .
I watch the TV almost everyday , mostly advertisement , I see the new cell phones everytime .
So many abilities of cell phone lured me to buy it , such as camera , mp3 , recorder , mirror , and walky talky .
Although I thought I will going to use it for sure , I did not use those abilities not much as I thought I would .
Because those abilities were less than I expected .
I will buy digital camera rather than camera phone , mp3 player rather than mp3 phone .
I was lured by watching advertisement .
I did not see the inside of cell phone but only believed in my vision .

Everytime I go to watch movie , I always decided to see the movie that has interesting poster , or has interesting short scene from the advertisement .
There are so many times that I regreted .
I realized that advertisements are important as much as qualities of the products .
I would not think that movies can not success without the advertisements .

The purpose of the advertisement is lure customers .
There are people make interesting advertisement , and that 's what they are for ; make it look better and nicer .
The market of the advertisements is growing , sometime company spend a lot of money to make best advertisement rather than make better quality .
However , we need to be warned before we purchase the products as well as understading the products .
