Everyone has differnt flavors about the traveling , and it always depends on the situation or the place a person is traveling .
The travel could be by alone , or by groups with tour guide in lots of places .
However , the best way to travel is to go on a trip with a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons for that .

First , if a person is traveling in unknown area by the traveler himself or herself , then it is more safe to go on with a group with a tour guide who know the area that the person is traveling .

Second , if the person is going alone , it is better to go on a trip with groups of people .
That way , the person can have the opportunity to meet new people as well as see new places .
Also the traveling with a group can more safe , because in case a person is lost during the trip , then he/she can get help from other people that the person is traveling with .

Third , going on a trip with a group of people will be more fun .
If there is more people , then more things you can do with lot of places .
For example , if a person is going to Las Vagas , then it would be whole lot for fun to go with lot of people to play poker together .

In some cases it would be the very nice if a person could have some own personal time for himself or herself during the travel with the group led by the tour guide .
These days , lots of tour guide provide free time during the traval for the travelers who would like to have some own personal time by themselves .

In conclustion , the most ideal way to travel is to go on a trip with a group led by a tour guide for safty and to enjoy , and if a person would like , then he/she could take some free time from the group and the tour guide .
