I do not agree with this statement has provided .
Young people could enjoy life in many different ways in present than past days however I do think the word , `` Enjoy '' means solely living without any worries .

First , Old people experienced many ways in life and these experiences bring to enjoy life .
When I first saw this statement , I came up with many different experiences that I heard from my grandmother and mother .
Simply , Old people lived more than young people did and this shows how old people experienced many different situations before the young people .
They already experienced and survived many different situations , so they deserve to enjoy life .

Second , Old people would have their children and grand children and to see how their own children growing and giving new births , are the real meaning of enjoy life .
I came up with this topin sentence to thinking about my grandmother in South Korea .
Even though I have n't seen her in past five years , I will never forget all the words that my grandmother told me .
In my experience , since I was young , my grandmother told me to respect parents and having family is the most happy thing in life .
As well as she told me that Young people could enjoy life in their ways however , they have more responsibilities about schoosl , futurse , jobs , and many more things until they think finished everything .
My grandmother told me that she has children and grand children and they all grown up to work everything by themselves so she does n't have to worry about future .
When she first thought about what is the real meaning of enjoy life , she said that even though she 's getting older and everything was n't like when she was young but only her mind was more peaceful and comfortable than when she was young .
As I heard that , I did think that I want to live like my grandmother .

In conclusion , Young people enjoy life as what they feel about to enjoy however , I do think old people do enjoy life more freely and happily than young people do and they should have to because they deserved to enjoy life .
