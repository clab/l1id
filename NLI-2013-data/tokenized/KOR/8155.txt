Many students hate to study , because it 's boaring , yet when the students realize the ideas and concepts .
At that time , the studing will be fun .
The ideas and concpets affect to students , grab the interesting , to understand what they learn , for unsing the ideas and concepts in our life and outstanding it .
The ideas and concepts are very important to students for learning school courses like math and science .

Many students hate to study because it 's boaring , and they do n't have interseting .
However , when they know ideas , and concepts , they will ahve interesting .
For example , Jason has son , he is 5 years old , Jason want to start teach him simple math , but the son does not have interesting and not good at math .
One day , Jason see the advertisement , `` most impotant thing is ideas and concpets . ''
He call to that educational company for helping .
After two moths , His son interset in the math , because he understands ideas and concpets .
Therfore the ideas and concepts are impotant to student to learning .

Students should know what they are learning , if they do not know what they are learing , the reason is they do n't understnad the ideas and concepts .
For instance , when we are evaluate the math questions in the class , however the students do not understnad the question , because they do n't know the concepts .
Thus , the ideas and concepts are impotatnt for understading student 's learning .

The purpose of learning is to use in our communicatio or society .
For example , James and Kyle , they both listen geography in their high school .
Yet , James understnads the idea and concpes of geography ; Kyle just memorise his text book .
After they graduate , they live in same village .
Oneday , the earthquake comes suddenly in their village .
At that time , James survive from the earthquake , because he understnds the ideas and concpet of erathqukae for his geography class .
However , Kyle gets serious injury , because he does not know the ideas and concpets of eathquke .
Therefore the ideas and concpets is very impotant for student learing material .

We agree , the ideas and concpets is important to understand for students .
For theses three reason , grab the intersing , to understnad what they learning , and for using in our society .
When we realize how important is ideas and concpets form these three reason .
We can understnad the ideas and concpts
