I agree with the statement .
We can see someone who success in his life with pursuing new things and taking risks .
We should n't be hang on our usual , binded thinking .
Creating something gives us successful life , happy emotions , comfortable feeling etc .

For example , our lots of equpiment , a computer , an refrigirator , an radio , an television , an laptop , a microwave etc were invented by someone long time ago .
If everybody think same thing just like normal people and behave , we do n't live now with convinence .
Certainly we could n't manage our life just like now .
Thank to them , we can live comfortably .
More and more the age change , we require more comfortable equipment , facility .
we ca n't satisfy our reality everytime .
So this time , we try to invent making something which will give us peaceful life .
Sometimes changing thinking accompanies danger .
But we should break the nervous feeling , furious feeling .
If we want to get innovation about something .
Besides , the japarody will create an fresh idea .

Depending upon only donig what I alreay know how to do well wo n't give me a good effect .
It will help me just live commonly .
So if we feel like thinking of varying , altering , innovating something , we should n't be hesitant to do it .
Shortly think and do it !
There is nothing to do with an great , huge idea to make an new idea .
Even if it is very simple and look so shabby , it is enough that you think about something by yourself creatively , differently over other people .
Only , with the reason , you deserve prasie .

I think that development is from not an big idea but an new idea .
It will be resource .
So if we want to alter from out-fashioned to out of stated , we should try to do it .
It will lead us to have successful life .
