It may be true that everyone wants to be successful .
But to become succeed is not easy .
If we refer to some people who have succeed in their life , we can find that what they did in order to succeed is not as same and simple as normal people do .
It is common that people who were successful have a common trait .
That is , they tried new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and I agree to this .
We can find the evidence of the statement as we read the articles of the lives of famous people such as Thomas Edison who was a genious in invention .
Also , there is a rule in the business that successful business people try new things and take risks .

I remember readinig an article about the life of Thomas Edison when I was young .
While reading it , I did n't understand why Thomas Edison tried to hatch an egg by himself , do experiments in the train , and other `` unpredictable '' things he did .
However , I now know that trying new things like him led to him as one of the successful people in the world , in invention .
It is because he learned from his tryouts .
He sometimes failed and succeed .
When he failed , he learned why he failed from what he did by figuring out what went wrong , what needs to be improved , and so on .
For example , he failed to hatch an egg because there is a certain conditions required to hatch an egg , the condition that hens have .
On the other hand , when he succeeded , he become more confident encourage himself to try other things .
Without these traits , he would not be one of the successful people .

In business studies , I learned that it is one of the facts that a successful business person tries new things and take risks , which is fairly true .
For example , if a person wants to start running a business in ice-cream market , he should have superior and interesting ideas that catch the attention of consumers .
To find unique ideas , he tries new things such as making new flavours of ice-cream which people did n't taste before , making interesting shape of the ice-cream , and so on .
Moreover , he should assume that he will be responsible for taking risks as he try new things .
If his idea fails , then he should replace the financial problems resulted from the failure .
However , as he get over these factors , he will later became a successful businessman in ice-cream industry .

People want to be successful but it is true that most of them do n't know how to succeed .
For them , I want to suggest to try new things and take risks , as statement said .
