Nowadays , many people want to success in their life .
Some people try to do very special thing that other people do n't try because they think that it is a way to make them better than other people .
I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First , successful people try to do new thing and take risks because they want to resist themselves from the life .
We live our life that is composed of continuous challenges .
There is no way to avoid these challenges .
If someone ignore the challenges , they will be a loser .
Not only this reason but also successful people want to examine themselves .
They do n't like such a flat and normal matter and They want to improve themselves .
Also , they love themselves so they do n't want themselves to be lazy .
It is really important point .

Second , Successful people try new things and take risks because they do n't afraid of other people 's saying .
After people do the things successfully , they feel self-confidence .
It is such an important part of our life .
If someone already succeed in some area , people will be admire him .
However , if he fails in the other area , people will ignore him more than before he succeed .
Actually other people is not the whole part of his life .
They are just part of his life .
Successful people know this so they do n't really mind other people .

If we try new things and take risks , we can improve ourselves more and more .
We can feel self-confidence , too .
Success is not a whole part of our life , but we need it to make life better .
If we try to make our life better , it will be great even though we fail in some area .
