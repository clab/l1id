I agree that successful people try to do new things and take risks rather than doing only one thing that they know well .

First of all , I think that learning is a life-long job .
Every person who wants to succed has to learn new things very hard .
I believe that having an open mind , trying to be adventurous and taking risks are the key to success .
If I am afraid of change and do n't want to give it a try on new things , I will not be able to develop myself .
For instance , say that I am afraid of water , so I avoid learning how to swim .
I never try to learn so I do n't know how to swim .
But one day , I was on a boat or a ship and the boat was on fire .
Or , I fell from the boat and I 'm in the middle of the sea , not being able to move .
What will happen then ?
I am a foreigner , good at my native language .
But since I am good at what I already know and do n't learn foreign language such as English , I will not be able to study in the states nor communicate with people from abroad .
I will be stuck in a little world .

Second , I think that people who resist to make changes become lazy and outdated .
They do not develop nor improve themselves and just sit idle only doing what they know how to do well .
I have seen many pople around me who become outdated and fall behind other people .
For example , many korean people who came to the states do not know how to speak English .
I was very shocked when I met some Koreans , who lived in the US for more than 10 years , not being able to speak English well .
The reason that they could n't speak was because they were comfortable with their life .
They did n't want to try new things or learn a new language .
Nor do they wanted to take risks to adapt in the American society .
They were just doing what was easy for them .
They only hang out with Koreans and watch Korean TV shows , and do not know what is going around in the US .
No self improvement nor development .

All in all , people who sit idle and just do what they already know well will not be able to succeed .
Only the ones who try new things and learn consistently will flourish and succeed .

If a person only does what he wants and does n't learn anything else but what he knows , the outdated person will not be able to succeed .
