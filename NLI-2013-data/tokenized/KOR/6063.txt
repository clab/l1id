There are some people saying that there will be more cars in the future than today , because the car is convenient for ourlife and it saves our time .
But others say that in the 20 years after there will be small amount of cars than now , because the energy is running out and the car is no more can work .

These two opinions are reasonable , but I agree the latter opinion .

Firstly , there is lesser and lesser petroleum the energy source of car .
But those kinds of resources are limited and someday it will be runned out .
Then , the car cannot work any more without constituting the energy source .
But within the 20 years it will be impossible to develop and commercialize the new energy sources .

Secondly , there are many regulations and consensuses about prohibiting the air popplliution .
The main source of air pollution is came from the car diving .
It will be more and more lessened to use cars all over the worled .

Thirdly , the traffic is so busy .
There are limted roads available which the car can go .
But it is overcrowded day by day .
As a result , the government construct many different transportation systems , such as railroad , bus , and subways , which reduce the road traffic .

In cities , at rush hours , traffic cause many people to waste their time on the road .
It results inefficiency to their work and everyday life .

In conclusion , in twenty years , the cars will be used little than today .
Because , there is little resources to run the cars , the car produce much polution which is regulated all over the world , and the traffic is so serious that the people use other transportation systems than choose cars .
