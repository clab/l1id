It may depend on what kind of field or job these successuful people are involved in .
If they are involved in a business industy that requires rapid update and application of creative ideas such as computer or car industry , I agree that sucessful people tend to try new things and take risk rather than doing what they alreayd know how to do well .

Successful people in these fields make a lot of money from successful business .
For example , Bill gates is known to be very rich person in the world as a founder of Microsoft company .
But his company is consistently trying to update the existing computer system or invent innovative new system , rather than staying as they are .
It may apply to most of the big companies that produce brand name products , including vehicles and electronics .
They spend large amount of money for research for the new and better product .
This kind of investment can be considered as taking risks .
Because they may not come up with better product as a result of research and may take a lot longer time to generate better product than they planned .
However , there is a chance to produce product with much more improved quality and this may lead to more successful business .

On the other hand , people that are considered as successful as working in traditionally respected professions , such as doctors or professors , they may not have to take much risks to stay successful .
Becasue their means of making money-treating patients or teaching students-do n't change fast .
Although they may have to keep up with a new trend of field needing to modify their methods .

Therefore , it may depend on the profession or business where they are involved inwhether they have a tendency to take a risk or not .
