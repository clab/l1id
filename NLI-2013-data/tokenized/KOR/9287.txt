I think for students to understand idea and concepts is more important than for them to learn facts .
I have very strong opinion about that .
My favorite subject is math and i like math but i can tell i 'm not suprer good at math but it 's alright not really bad .
On my way to do it math is i do not think about that the answer is .
i need to know how should i solve it .
If i just know the answer then what am i learning ?
to finding answer skills ?
not really .

For history and math or other things to learn , first thing that you have to understand .
You need to know what your doing .
My math teacher not only counts the answer .
I need to show how i got this answers .
if i only write the answer then i will lose my points .
That is the idea that im telling .
it would continue that if you have a same situation that you did before but you do n't know what to do , then what are you going to do ?
nothing .

I could tell the fact is just cover , and understand or concept is inside .
i hope that people look at the inside .
Of cource the fact is important we have to know what is correct or not .
i know many people just want the fact expect the how did you understand .
you have to make your own thing , that calls understand .

if you understand then you can solve easily that you expect .
Sometimes just look at the bright side that do not just focusing on the fact .
You need to know the way you did .
it is more important for students to understan idea and concept than just facts .
it should be good experience for your life .
