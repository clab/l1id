As we all know , creative people succeed in our society .
I agree on the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .
Basically there are two reasons ; for new inventive ways , and another chance of getting failure .

Firstly , you can have better solutions if you try new things .
If you recall all the inventions in this world , those were invented through the attempts to try the things in another new way .
Successful people also try new things to have new inventions of their own .
Since the creativity is the key to the succeed in these days , the chance you can be successful is up to your creativity , which means , trying new things with probable risks .

Secondly , you can have the failures to learn from them .
Even if you had failed in the attempt for a new way , you are still gaining something from it : the evaluation skills .
You can evaluated the process yourself and find the new other ways that will not repeat the same mistake .
And if you succeed , you can have another new way of your own , which you know so well since you invented it .

For conclusion , I think if you want to be successful , you should be creative enough to undertake the risks that can be follow your creativity , because in that way , you can have your own solutions to be successful , and that you can learn from the failure if you had failed .
