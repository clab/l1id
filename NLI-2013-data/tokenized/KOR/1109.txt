I disagree with this statement because I do n't think that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than to specialize in one specific subject .
In many kinds of careers , There are many careers which need the specialized skill in the process .

There are several reasons .
First , In executing the work , if we have more specialized knowledge in the working process we can do the work more exactly and fastly than the people who has not specialized knowledge .
For example , a friend of mine has specialized knowledge in business marketing field more than others so now he has a splendid job in a famous big company and he is executing the work excellently and many co-workers are respecting him and his working skill .

Second , in some case , The people who has not specialized knowledge may not execute the work at all .
For example , my major is architecture , exactly interior design .
In architecture field , If the planner or designer has not special skill or knowledge about structure and resist for many thing ( water , wind , heat ) , he cannot design the tall building , airport , school even if small house .
For above statement , In this world , there are many kind of works which need the specialized skill not only architecture field .
So we have to learn about many knowledge in the specific subject to work for the specific field .

Finally , Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is just only memorising the Britaniker dictionary .
With these many knowledge we can only use the knowledge at small and paltry question and we cannot use the knowledge at specialized work field .
If we want to have a good job for me making much money and feeling happy with our job , we have to have the specialized knowledge in our specific subject or field .
