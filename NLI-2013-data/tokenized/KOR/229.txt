Many people tavel by a group led by a tour guide today .
I have trveled both with the guide and by myself .
When you travel alone , you will be able to do things that you would like to do .
However , I think it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

When you travel in a group led by a tour guide , they give you a lot of information about that country .
You will get to know abot the historical events that happened , and learn the things that you did not know by listening to the tour guide .
For example , When I was in elementary school , I went to France .
We had a tour guide .
Since he explained things really detailed and humorusly , I listened to him carefully and I got to know a lot of details of France after the tour .

Next , you do not have to care about where to go for restaurant and if you will get lost while traveling .
When you tour with a tour guide , they will lead you to the one of the nice restaurants and where to go .
If you travel alone you might get lodt often , since it is the place you have never been before .

Finally , the tour guide will probably know the langage of the country they are guiding .
If you do not know the language of the country you are visiting , you will have hard time talking to people .
But , when you travel in a tour group , you do n't need to have hard time making conversation to people , sonce the tour guide translate things to you .

To conclude , I think it is much better to travel in a group led by a tour guide because you can get a lot of useful information , you do n't have to care about where to go or fetting lost and you do n't have to concern about the language .
