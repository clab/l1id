Some people think it is for them to learn fact , but others think it is more important for students to understand idears and concepts personally , I agree this is very important to studants .

Among them many reason , the most important is that students develop their technology and ideas .
It is better that the students have more deep thinking and responsibility .
Forexample , My cousin is 12years old .
Although he has many books , he do n't understand many part exately math .
So his mother bought one book about understand idears and concepts .
he enjoy the book and always try to understand anything .
Right now he like math .

To conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
