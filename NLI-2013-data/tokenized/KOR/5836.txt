In this ambivalent society , the issue whether there will be fewer numeber of vehicles on the land in the future or not is often raised and debated .
A portion of society believes that there will be much more cars in our lives , since the opportunity of delivering goods increases as time goes by ; however , I have a differing idea .
In twenty years , the number of cars will decrease because the society encounters environmental and social changes : the Greenhouse Effect , and Globalization .

One example of a trigger that makes the number of cars reduce can be seen in the responses to the Greenhouse Effect .
As society grows , environmental issues are raised , especailly the Greenhouse Effect .
This Effect , caused by damaging gases emitted from cars , harms ecological order by influencing sea level to rise .
Furthermore , unexpectedly changing climates threatens human live directly : Tsunami in Indonesia .
Therefore , people begin to invent alternative vehicles that does not make harmful gases , such as hybrid vehicles .
In addition , the increasing uses of bikes encourage people to avoid air pollution .
Thus , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in our lives to protect our surronding safe and clean .

Not only do the current events furnish an endless array of examples encapsulating the claim that the number of cars on land will be reduced in the future , but social trend does as well ; a prime example is Globalization .
As the whole world become a one town , the opportunity to trade and travel among foreign countries has been expanding .
As a result , rather than cars that are limited in only one continent , airplanes will attract more people in the future .
For example , according to the research in Korea , about 85 % of the nation prefers airplanes as transportation .
Also , as most companies , such as Samsung , LG , and Sony , expands their markets toward other countries , the importance of taking airplanes , instead of driving cars in domestic markets , are percieved by many nations .

In the paragraphs above , I have shown that in twenty years , there will be much fewer cars in our live , but much more alternative vehicles that prevent environment and help to adopt international trend , Globalization .
So , I call the readers to make technological progress in innovating our limited transportation to prepare comming future society .
