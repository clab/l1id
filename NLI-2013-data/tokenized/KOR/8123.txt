When I was a student in high school in my country , South Korea which country has a lot of test in school system , I studied hard to get a good grade on my test in a short time .
So , I had tutor to help my study .
The tutorial was a professional to lead her student to study efficiently .
Her teaching way was to give an ideas and key concepts to her student .
First of the half week , I was the way far from the class that I was n't sure about what points she wants to point out .
However , after few lectures with her , I really grasp the main point that contains the fact that we try to reach .
With my great experience , I agree with the opinion that understaning ideas and concepts is more important than leaning facts for the three facts .

First of all , The facts that we learn is usually has the some `` reasons '' why that facts occured .
The `` reasons '' is an ideas and comcepts .
To recall of my school days , my professor was always teaching the student about the main key ideas to approach to the main problems , the facts .
This approaching way to the fact was really helpful to think up the multi other facts .

Second of all , When we read a textbook , you will soon find out that it says a lot of the concepts of the facts .
This fact shows me that the author of that textbook pocus on the concepts rather than just pointing out the facts .
As we generally know , the textbook authors always try to help readers understanding .
And the authors way to writing textbook is shows as many information that could give the ideas and concepts .

Third of all , In the real lecture test , the professor do not only ask about facts .
Professors usually ask about how the facts happened , or presented .
It means that many of professors believe that studying and understand ideas and concepts rather than study only fact is more effective to learn .

In conclusion , It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
