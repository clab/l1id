There are different opinions among people concernig whether having broad knowledge of many subject is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject .
Although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people in various problems , as far as I am concerned , I conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life .
I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea .

The first reason is that because the society will change more complicated , the demand for the specialized knowledge or skills would increase .
In fact , in ancient age , people should do everything well to survive , but now people do n't need to be capable of everything .
For example , famous baseball star can earn enomous amout of money only because of his abilities of throwing balls fast .

The second reason is that in modern society people cannot obtain broad knowledge of many specific subject .
Nowadays socioty new knowledges and skills are produced so fast and much that we ca n't keep up with the pace of the development .
If there is a person that is able , the person 's faith is only his or her subjective faith .

For example , we could not even imagine the internet only a thirty years ago .
Of course , broad knowledge of many subject can help people make their life balanced and rich .
However , the more important things to do in modern society is to specialize in one specific subject a person can do well and interested in .

In conclusion , I would rather specialize in one specific subject than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
