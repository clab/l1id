I agree that successful people are not only doing what they already know how to do well but try new things and take risks .

For example , about five hundred years ago , Korean Naval General Yi was continue win consist Japan Naval army .
But he does n't confuse it and forecasted more bigger war after a few years .
So he made many new ships and training his army .
Therefore , after a few years he made so biggest win from Japan .

Second example is my mother .
She already gave many wealth and became well-known people in society .
But in 1998 , Korea met IMF .
As my mother taked risk , she felt to leck education level herself .
In fact , she was graduated elementary school only .
So she started middle school course when she was 45 years old .
Lastly , graduated middle school , high school , and university .
As I am a person who see my mother most nearby , I strongly confuse it .

In my opinion , when successful people meet difficult thing , they always challenge new thing .
