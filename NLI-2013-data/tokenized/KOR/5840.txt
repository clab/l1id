It is reported that the number of cars has been increased for past ten years .
In some cities , persons not having cars are regarded as to be even strange .
However , I strongly agree that in the future less cars will be used because of their bad effects on environment and other transportion .

To begin with , current used cars have many drawbacks .
First of all , the environment has been polluted by cars .
The harmful gas from cars causes respitory diseases .
On top of that , the gas results in globla warming .
This is why governments regulates sales of cars .
For instance , in many contries , bicycles are encouraged to use for going near place in stead of using cars , and in Korea , a person who have over three cars should pay tax as six times much as a person having only one car .
Moreover , annually , an uncountable number of serious car accidents break out .
This prevents many people from using cars .

In addition , in the future many better transportation ways or vehicles will appear .
Already , airplanes and express trains are widely used thanks to their fastness .
The need of them has been increasing becasue moder people consider time important .
For example , in Korea , my countrary .
An express traine was introduced about three years ago .
Because of it convenience , usually , people choose it for going to Busan from Seoul .
The fees of it is less expensive than the fee of gase for a car .
In addition , engineers are inventing new transportation by using the state-of-art technology such as magnetic floating train .
It is expected these new transportation wil appear soon ,

In a nut shell , I strongly believe that fewer cars will be used in twenty years .
A car is too dangerous to the environment as well as human .
We will be able to use more convenient and fast transportation .
