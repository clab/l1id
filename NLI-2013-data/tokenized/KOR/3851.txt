I firmly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my country , it is the biggest problem that young people do not want to volunteer their communities .
They just give their time to study or get a good job .

My country has a programm that give some points to teenager who help their communities .
At first , it was successful because every young adults attended this programm .
However , after 1990 , education programm was changed so students did not want to join community activity at all .
So it changes a duty of students .
Soon , it changed the hatest programm to young adults .
They attend communities ' programm just for get a points , not in serious .
According to this situation , I can feel that nowadays ' young people do not want to help their villages .

Also , all communities in my country are helped by adults .
If young people who live in my town want to join the town club to help their community , they will depressed because club president will not admit them .
My communitiy has strange custom that club member 's age have to over than 30-year-old .
It is unfair to young people but adults still keep this custom .
It makes teenager to do not have attention to their communities .

In addition , there are several researches support an important reasons that young people did not attention to their communities .
Accoridng the famous scientist team in my country asserts that nowadays ' young people are shy and not out-goint than 30 years ago , so they do not show their opinion to others .
Because of young people 's personalities , communities are helped by only adults .

Although there are countries that totally different from my country .
However , countries which are located in eastern world have similarity of this trend .
Therefore , I claims that young people do not give enough time to helping their societies .
