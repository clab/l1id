In my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons : the younger people have more energy to do something fun , they have greater choices in living their lives , and lastly they are not as serious about life as the older people are .

The youg people enjoy life more than old people do because they have more energy to do something fun than older people .
When people are young they have better body structure for producing energy therefore young people can do anything they want to do with that energy whereas old people can not because of their age and health problems .

Another reason why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do is because young people have greater choices .
While people are young , they like doing something adventurous therefore they tend to bring in as many choices as they can in to their lives .
In the other hand , most older people does n't like to do adventurous things because they usually have families under their control and they do n't want to risk their family and settled life being advantageous .

Lastly , because young people are not as serious about their lives as the old people are I think the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Usually young people do n't worry about being so mature and serious as much as the old people do .
As a result , they are more progressive in living thier lives .
When old people often think what they should do and not in deciding something , the young people just try to do whatever they want do to .
