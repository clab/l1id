Today , many students seem to choose to study more than one major in the university for certain purposes .
To know more than one subject or major can be a benefit for people , but I believe that to specialize in one specific field is a better choice because in the long run , more knowledge of diverse subjects will be beneficial to the future career .
In addition , it encourages people to think more creatively .

To begin with , general knowledge on every aspect of academic subjects is essential to perform a job of higher position and lead people in the future .
To be sure , special skills and knowledge help people to get better jobs and give them more ability to achieve what they want in work place or in academic field .
However , as people go up to the superior position , or to take more responsibility , they will have to see the whole forest , not a single tree .
That means , without general knowledge in every aspect that is related to the entire goal or process , you will likely to get lost in how to manage and lead other people in the respective field .
In this sense , people need to broaden thier view and this can be done by studying many academic subjects .

Furthermore , with their broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people are able to develop their potential creative-thinking ability .
It is widely know that creativeness evolves from various academic backgrounds .
For example , I have a cousin who studies a lot of subjects in the university .
She is majoring in english literature , but she also studies on other subjects such as music , physics , and golf .
This made her think and act creatively .
She won the most innovative essay of the university twice and a lot of professor say that her problem-solving way is always fresh and new .
This shows that many academic knowledge encourages the creativeness .

In summary , to have specialized and professional knowledge on a certain subject may a benefit to people , but because general information will help people in the future and it generates creativity , I agree to have broad knowledge .
