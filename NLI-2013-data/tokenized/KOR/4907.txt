In general , the purpose of the advertisement is to increase the customer 's custom .
Therefore , the advertisements are usually quite over expressing about the products ' properties .
First of all , because a person who plans the advertisement is the person who wants to sell the goods , the advertisement follows the seller 's intention .
Since the seller desires to sell as many as goods as s/he can , the advertisement sometimes even exaggerates the character of the product .
Hence , although the impression that advertise makes is not exactly same as that of the product , the customer has no way to figure out the fact .

Moreover , the advertisement is limited in either short time or rooms to express the character of the goods .
As a result , the sellers need to point out all the strong points of the product and express those under the limited condition .
Due to this limitation , the seller would not present the unbeneficial sides of the product on the advertisement .
On the other hand , the customer can accept only the shown aspects on the advertisement and loses opportunity to evaluate the goods in various views .

In addition , the skills that are used in the advertisement affect on the impression that customer receives .
To make an effecient advertisement , the seller uses some skills to take a good-looking picture and computer graphics such as photoshop .
Thus , the image that comes out on the advertisement might look like more attractive than it actually look like .
The customer , however , just accepts that impression as it is because s/he does not have any clues to judge the product in other ways .

In short , as the advertisement is made by the product seller , it tends to follow the seller 's intention and therefore , it makes the goods better than really they are .
Also , as it uses fascinating skills to gain customer 's attention more , the customer can be easily tricked by the impression that shows up on the advertisement .
Hence , to maek a good decision , the customer should have certain value to judge products that are represented on the advertisement .
