Do young people not give enough time to helping their communities ?
At first glance , it sounds persuasive because we have fewer family members than before and the lack of opportunity to mingle with more siblings could results in lack of chance or minds to help people in their communities .
However , I believe the young people are more active to helping people nowadays for following reasons .

First , instead of being exposed to more family members , they are engaged in activities held by communities where they live in , which will help them to open up for the importance and necessity of the interacting each other in helping people and in develping the community .
In the weekly local newspaper I am receiving weekly basis , I can find the articles of the young people helping the community .
They were so deeply acknolwdged the true value of joining the community activities that it naturally motivated them to prosper the place they are belonged to .

Secondly , many schools are encouraging students to participate in the social activity and to serve people in need .
Moreover , most of the respectful universities give better score to the students who have the good records of serving people in their communities than those who do n't have community service experiences .
Since students are fully aware of the fact and its value , it is evident that students will be eager to engage in social activities for their competitiveness in college entrance exam .
I think this is a very good policy for the good of majority and we have to maintain this to be a tradition for our society .

In sum , although the population of the community may be decreased and it might be one element keeping young people from helping people , community system and school authoties have encouraged the young to help people and servie their communities .
Thus , I can confidently say that the young people nowadays are giving as enough time to helping their communities as their ancestors had done in the past .
