I neither agree nor disagree with the point suggested above .
I believe that the success can be obtained by trying new things as well as practicing what is already known to us .

Things that are already known might not be as refreshing and exciting as new technologies or knowledges , but they 're still important , because you cannot do anything advanced without learning the old things correctly .
For example , let 's say that I 'm a member of a medical research group that is trying to develop a new type of medicine for brain cancer .
Even if the point is ` trying to find a new way , ' you cannot perform the task successfully unless you know and perform the previous things very well .
That is , in order to develop the new medicine , you have to learn all the previously accumulated knowledges about medicines and brain cancer first .

At the same time , however , new technologies and trials are certainly shortcut to the success .
Many people who had denied the stereotypes and tried new things had succeeded and become a billionair .
And that is indeed how our history had advanced so far .
People have tried new ideas , knowledges , vogues , systems , and so forth , and up to now we 've become a highly industrialized world .
Even only 3 or 4 hundred years ago , our life used to be all about church and work .
But things get changed and changed .
And if those new things have n't been tried , our world must have been stagnated and still .
And that rule applies to an individual as well .
As long as you stick to the old topic , you cannot go forth .
History has proved that for you .

So my whole point is that the success can be obtained only when you respect the already known things and new things equally .
Neither old things nor new things can exist without the other .
Old things exist to be used and to be replaced by new things .
But without the accumulated history , new things cannot come into its place .
