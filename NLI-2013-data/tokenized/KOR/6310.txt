In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I extremely agree with because of following two specific reasons .

First .
using the car might be decrease because of economic problems .
If you want drive , you can recognize that your car wants fuel .
Becase of many reasons , oil price is getting expensie .
I think there are not many people to afford such a high price for driving .

Secondly , people who live in a big city do not have enough time for exercise .
I can see many warning copies and ads .
Most of doctors suggest that people have to exercise more than they think .
My university noticed that use a bycicles rather than cars or motorcycles .
School doctor also said to me that do more exercise .
Many people will join this campaign , and so many people use their bycicles instead of cars .
I 'm sure that this movement is not only processing in my country .

In conclusion , I 'm sure that there are many beneficial aspects by using car .
But I strongly argue that in twenty years will be fewer cars than today because of economic and personal reasons as I said .
