I believe that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because that the young people in nowadays does not care about other people around them and only cares about themselves .
The communities such as , helping senior citizens , donating things such as what you do not need or money needs more people to help them .
The young peope also have no time because they go out with their friends orthey need to study for t heir own goodness .

Firstly , the young people need to begin to care more about other people than themselves and they should help other people having a lot of difficulties .
According to the survey , less then 30 % of in age of 15 to 30 are helping communities which means that only 20 % of the population of that country is helping the communites .
The young people should start helping poor communites soon as possible .

Moreover , the young people also does not have time to help the communities because that they go out with their friends .
For the some young people they do not have any time because of theit school work of study .
However , the young people should help the communites even though they do n't have any time .
If the people has time to go out with their friends or family , they should help the communities in that time .
The people who study and says they have no time , they are wrong .
They do have time to help the poor people .
For example , they can donate money by using internet but they need to be careful since some internet sites are fake and unofficial .

In conclusion , the young people does not have time to help their communities but they can make the time and help the communities .
There are only few people helping the poors and others are just saying `` no time '' .
I believe that the people should help the communites although they have no time .
The young people should change now from caring themselves to caring other people as well .
So , the young people really dont have time but it does not mean they can not help their communites .
