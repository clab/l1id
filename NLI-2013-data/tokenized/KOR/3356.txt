Do you have a child if you are married ?
If you do , do you think which one is better ?
The children is very smart .
But , he does n't study at all because he really likes helping his communities .
The other children is not smart .
But , after all , he enters the company which is the most famous one in the world .
If I have a child , I want him or her to focus on his work when they 're suppose to study their own work .
That is definitely true .
Therefore , young people should focus on their work .
I have two reasons why this is very important for them .

To begin with , young people have a duty of education .
When I was young , one of my friends was very kind to everyone , even bad students .
Also , he was a member of community for the poor .
We thought he would be great person in the future .
However , it was just our thought .
Nowadays , he is have a hard time living his life with his parents because he has no job , even could n't go to the college .
That means that we have to do our duty when we have a duty .
If we do n't do our duty , someday it 'll bring a bad situation to them like the above case .

In addition , actually , young people are not suppose to have a extra time for their communities .
It sounds very strict and miserable , however it is obviously true , espeically in South Korea .
I saw the article about it yesterday .
They talked about most young people attend more than three institutes such as English , the Piano , the madthmatics and etc .
The interesting is that most of them have been going to be able to enter the best college .
That 's why most parent want their children to attend lots of private classes include regular class of school .

Finally , what do you think about my opinion ?
I think that you ca n't agree with this .
However , people should know about somehing like follow things .
If a person did their work well when a person was young , someday this person will be success .
Then , they can help thieir communities and their society .
That is not late because it will be already great job .
