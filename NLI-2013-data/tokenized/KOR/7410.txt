I disagree the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .
Recently even one tour package is becoming a product of commercial society for fun .
I want to define that traveling is experiencing new space .
Unfortunately , current people are attracted in luxurious or expensive tour package .
There is a reasons why i do not agree that statement .

The reason is that if you travel alone or with your friends without a tour guide , you would experience something exciting or new definitly .
For example when I was in high school , I and three friends of mine went to travel without money or any availible item .
We had to deal with most difficult situation .
We caught fishs in the river to make our dinner and gathered wood for fire .
We felt that it was very terribile and hard but now the only thing I can remember about travels in my life is that no money travel .
After the travel , I can have more positive attitude and strong capacity .
It is a valuable gift that the travel gives to me .
So I recommand that if you want to experience something exciting and interesting , you must leave now alone or with your friends .
Do not worry about money or hardship .
The travel would give you more valuable thing than money or comfort from luxurious tour .

In conclusion , I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
If you try to experience new , leave now .
The only thing luxuriuos travel can give you is reducing your money .
Take a risk and you will achive something .
