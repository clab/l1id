It discussed that these days , the youth do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with the statement .
Compared to past , yougn people do not have enough time to help their communities .
It is partly due to change of social envrionments .
This esay will discuss two reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities in based on social changes .

First of all , living costs are getting higher than past .
Consequently , young people have to work hard and improve their skills .
For example , in last 50 years , buying a house is not cost alot compared to nowadays .
They do not try to make more money to buy a house but they also want to spend money for their entertaintments .
Most of young people enjoy traveling around country or even overseas .
They take more time to having hobby or enjoy their life .
Moreover , they also improve their knowledge wich is quite related to their job such as computer skills or learning other language in their spare time .
They do not have choice to work hard to living well and a society requires the ablilities from young people .

Secondly , young people do not concern their communities unlike past .
It is because that the social envrionments are changed .
In the past , members of community spend time with their neighbers like a big family .
It is because that they work together to farming or work in the smae company .
However , these days young people are more concerns about themselves than their communities .
They do not go to the same company or even same school .
Developing of communication technologies make possible to communicate with many people including living in distant area .
Ironically , due to the developed technologies such as Internet or video games which most of young people like those people lose time to interact with members of communities .
They can call them or meet up on Internet .
Because of this social mood , young people do not take care about communities .

In conclusion , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities due to .
However , it is not only fault of young people .
It is because of the social changes .
The living costs are rapidly increasing and social moods are changed to care about more individual issues .
In my personal oppnion of this , local communities should try to bring more concern from the young people to help their communities .
