I do not agree with the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Firstly , techonology will not advance that faster that the role of cars will be replaced by the more advanced technology such as plane or ultra fast train .
Secondly , developing worlds will someday will reach to the point that their major transportation becomes cars .

To begin with , it seems impossible that the more advanced trasportation technologies such as plane or ultra fast train replace the role that current car has .
It is true that in twenty years time , the techonology will be much more develpoed .
However , it draws some skepticism that twenty years later , everyone has access of plane at their home like almost everyone has a car in their house today .
For example , South Korea , in 1986 , already considerable number of people owned cars .
In 2006 , there are still numerous number of people who are not able to get a car because they are too expensive to afford .
It was impossible to even manage car for everyone in twenty years time for the country , then how would it be possible to people to manage some other advanced technology in twenty years time ?
It is just too hard to imagine .

Antoher significan point is that there are more develpoing countries than developed countries in the world .
It will be a bit easier for the people who live in developed countires to imagine the world in twenty years with fewer cars , whether it is for the environmental reason or they dream about the better techonology , Nonetheless , developed coutnries such as many African countries , Eash-Asia countrie still need to take a step to the sociey that every people in their nation owns a car .
That basic stage even has not come to them yet .
Even though people in developed countries use fewer cars in twenty years time , there will be more number of cars overall in the world because the people from the developing countries would be able to manage cars by then .
For example , if China , India or Russia grow the pace the they are growing at the moment , in twenty years of time , people from the nations will use more than millions cars .

It might be possible that fewer cars will be used in twenty years time , however , i think there are far too many problems that unables this statement firstly as the technology will not develop that fast and there are too many develping countire which need to catch up the current technology .
Therefore , it would be impossible to manage less car in twenty years time .
