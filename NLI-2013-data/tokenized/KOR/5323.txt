I agree this statement .
Although I admit it is important that products has real quality , there are several reasons that I think advertisements make products more valuable and it is quite important .

First of all advertisements give people to know about the products easily and convienetly .
Everyday we can meet lots of product ad by newspaper , and TV even internet .
That gives people more belive it is good product .

For example , one of american wine ad gives people belive that wine made from Amercia is very good compared with made in France or Chile .
They ad by producing process and taste with some celebrity and change the common belief that American wine is low quality Second , the advertisement represent the product 's image .
So sometimes people buy the product because of their image .
For my personal experience , I like basketball so much in junior high school .
I always play with my classmate but I am not tall it 's very hard to jump up to catch the balll .
I am very deprssed .
However I watch the ad unexpectdly and it changes my life .
It 's Air Jordan shoes produced by NIKE .
He jumps up so highly just like frogs .
After watch the ad I buy the jirdan shoes and I am very confident at jumping and I can play well and I represent my junior school basketball team .
Of course Jordan shoes is just one of the shoes but ad gives consumer it is more better than what it has and believe it is best shoes , In conclusion I firmly belive that ad make products seem much better because it 's purpose is to sell the product .
And nowadays people is very busy all days they are mostly dependant on ad to buy the product .
