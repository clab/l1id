I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are more challenging , more active , and more socialized .
Young people lived shorter time of life than older people .
That means , young people have not learned as many as lessons or experinced more .
From not knowing what consequences are going to come , young people challenge more than older people .
By challenging new things young people can enjoy more and experience .
And from experiencing and learning they become older people .

Having a younger body can help enjoy life .
Young people have more physical strenght than older people .
As you get older people get less active .
Especially when you get old , many parts of body does not work as before .
On the otherhand , youn people has enough energy .
They can go sky diving , run all day , or even dance all night .
To do lots of things people need strength .
Physical strength can be a big part if enjoying the life .

Young people are very socialized .
Young people go out at public than older people .
They meet more people and like to be outdoors .
By meeting diversity of people they learn and get to enjoy people and life .

Young people experience more and enjoy life than older people .
Young people have a lot of energy and desire to do more things to enjoy life .
But older people have enjoyed life when they were the young people .
Everyone starts young and gets old .
So everyone enjoys life .
