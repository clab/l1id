i disgree that successful peaple try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do .
i think try new things and take risk is so interesting .
for instance , i usually speaking english .
I want to study chinese and japanese .
and i study other lauguage , i need the time .
but time to past , try new thing is great .
try new thing is creative .
almost people is formal but successful peaple is creative and have a confidence .
try new thing is somewhat dangerous but i do n't care .
only doing what they already know how to is boring and life is not fun therefore my opinion is , To soccess our life have a confidence and new things and take risk .
