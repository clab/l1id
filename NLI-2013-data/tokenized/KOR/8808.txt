There are large number of people who are intelligent in this world .
They have a lot of knowledge and they do know many facts about the most types of studying .
Can we really consider all of them as smart and the most successful people in the world ?
Maybe , but certainly not all of them .
I say we can call a person intelligent if he/she understands the ideas and the concepts of the facts they have learned , not only solid facts that are memorized .
In order to educate our student , more intelligent and successful , it is more important to make students understand ideas and concepts .

It is not hard to find people with lots of information and facts in their brains .
It 's also not rare to find them having difficulty of explaning thier ideas of how those concepts they know make sense or funtion .
One of the reason why most of them are not capable of doing that is because that they just have memorized what the teacher or others have told them .
They just remember what they are told .
Those kind of `` smart '' people knows that 1 + 1 = 2 but they do not know why , because their teachers never explained them or they did not tend to know about those things .
This derive us to the fact that they are smart because they know the facts that some others might not know but not really because they do n't understand the ideas and concepts that are related to the facts they know .

Students are prepared for their future lives in a bigger society in schools and what our society wants are the people who are smart , who know how to apply their knowledge in certain situations .
People who only learned about the facts but not about their nature or concepts do not really know how to use their knowledge in a real life .
They have their knoledge in their head only .
On the other hand , people who know the facts and also fully understand the ideas and concepts , know how to apply those knowledge in any situation they encounter .
They do know how certain things work so therefore they can change things in order to their understood ideas and concepts , and make it work for most situations .

A school is an institution where teachers teach students to be prepared for their future .
It is not a factory where workers just put some information to their computers ' database .
In order to fulfill the goal of the institution and also to make sure educate students in the way where they are able to use and apply their knowledge in their everyday life , the school should teach and the students should tend to learn ideas and concepts rather than just to learn facts because it is much more important .
