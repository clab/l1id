A lot of controversy exists over weather traveling with a group or by alone .
However , I strongly believe that traveling in a group led by tour guide is more valuable than traveling without a group .
when I trip with group , it can be benificial .
Also , I can make good relationship with my members of the group .

The first reason why I would like to trip with large group is that traveling can be extremly helful for me .
I get information about new places I wanted to know from the tour guide and share knowledge with my group members .
This creats more beneficial traveling for everyone .
For example , I visited the states last year with a group led by a tour guide .
I did not have information about the place which I viewed , but the tour guide explained very carefully and friendly so that I could understanding the place 's history and charactoristics .

In addition , traveling with a group makes me socialize with people .
When some people are in trouble during the trip , such as ill or losing money , other people can cooperate each other so that they can solve their problem easily .
Also , I can learn to control myself .
Group activities need to each person 's responsibility and ability of self control .
When I do well in the group , I will be able to learn a sense of accomplishment .

It is often said that traveling in a group with a tour guide has some of nagative points .
However , If I have a chance to trip , I will choose traveling with a goup of people for my enjoyable trip .
It can be beneficial and It offers people to socialize with others .
All we should notice that when people are traveling or exploring new places , having a tour guide and a group of people are positive influeces for their trip .
