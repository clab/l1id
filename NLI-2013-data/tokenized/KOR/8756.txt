I agree that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learing facts .
In our society , people study in school for long time and learn about lots of things such as math , english , science , and history .
When we learn concepts or ideas of any courses in the school , we have hard time to remember concepts and facts because we do not understand ideas .
I believe understanding ideas and concepts are important because we can remember longer than learning facts and easy to learn new studies .

First , If we understand ideas and concepts , we can remember longer than learn facts .
we learn processes or concepts before we learn facts because it is the easy way to understand .
Although many people learn facts , they can not remember for long time .
For example , I am in anatomy class and the beginning of the year , I just memorized facts and I did not try to understand concepts ; I did not get good grades on my report card .
But , after I got first report card , I tried to understand concepts and I got a good grade .
Understanding ideas is first step to get knowledge .

Second , in my opinion , .
all studies that we learn in school connect to other studies in high school or college .
After we graduate high school , we go to college for our dreams .
If we understand concepts ; we can learn other things easily .
For instance , my friend , she is college student and she stuided european history in her senior year and her major is art in college .
she realized that the history connect to the art alot although they are not same kinds subjects .
In addition , she thinks if we understand any concepts .
they connect to the other studies ; it is easy to learn new things and get better understanding of studies .

In my opinion , understanding concepts lead easy way to remember study and convenience way to study new study .
I believe understanding is one of the most important concep of the education .
