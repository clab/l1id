Many believe that in the earlier stage of life , you are most likely to have more ` fun ' than that of in the later stage .
There is even a saying in Korea which says , when translated , ` Enjoy life whilst you 're still young ! '
.
My opinion on this topic is that , people 's enjoyment in life does n't depend on the age of that human being , but the perspective , experiences they have encountered , and the situation the people are in .

My reasons for believing this is because firstly , personally looking at my parents , hearing their experiences of their daily-lives , I picture happy , laughing , relaxed people , not stressed over homework , projects , tests , what they 're going to be later on in their life , or their duties in the house .
Occasionally I even wish I was a fully grown person , to have a job , and not stress over of choosing what job I 'm going to get .
I believe that I am not the only one who has ideas simliar to this , especially 12th grade students , who are preparing to play their role as a fully grown adult in the society .

Secondly , sometimes when my parents have too much to do , they tend to look at my sister and I and say something along the lines of ` You are very lucky to be so young , not to have any worries or concerns on the problems of the real world ' .
They say that they wish they could go back in time and re-live their lives as an adolesence .

Summing up , I think that every human being has a different opinion on this topic whether old or young , affected by their personal experiences , the environment around them , and the situations they are in .
A young one may look like they \ re enjoying life to another older person , and visa versa .
