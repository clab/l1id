We can often see many sucessful people in daily newpapers and magazines .
Have you ever wondered what they have in common .
I claim that sucessful people tend to try new things more and do n't afraid of risks .
This innovative ways will make them more successful .

First , people who try new things and take risks have more chances to overcome their own lilmits .
While they are taking risks , they can inspire themselve to develop , and this self-development will be the foundation of sucess .
For example , when I was in university , I did n't like the subject `` English composition '' a lot , but I had to pass it to graduate from school .
When I registered the course at first , I hasitated a lot but I decided to take a risk and then , finally , I passed this course sucessfully .
In addition , I had an opportunity to find my interest in English .
Since then , English is one of my specialties that everyone admit .

Second , when you are trying to do new things , you can be more creative .
That 's because you face risks and there 's no sample to solve this problem .
For instance , let 's take a look at a computer company `` Apply . ''
While other computer companies were focusing on only technology , `` Apply '' was pursuiting a different way , design .
While `` Apply '' is emphasizing the design , they created more designe than people had expexted .
Afterward , now almost everyone in a subway has a iPod in their hands .

Finally , while peole who love to try new things are handling their tasks , they will not follow the traditional ways .
These new ways will boost them to find better and faster ways to success .
For example , when you do your work in your office or your room , have you ever changed the order of your daily rutine ?
At the begining , you might be confused by little things but , at the end , you will find more fun with better ways to deal with your work .

In conclusion , I 've mentioned why I believe sucessful people pursut noveler ways of doing things and do n't afraid of risks .
That 's because they can get over their limits with creativity .
Moreover , while they are pursuiting new ways , they can find better and faster methods to accomplish their work .
