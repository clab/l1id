Traveling in a group with a tour guide , a way of taking a trip with a group of people with one guide attached , is an effective way of traveling for the people who do n't know well about the region .
However , since this way of travelling restricts the personal freedom and chances to meet the local people , it is certain that traveling in indiviual is a better way of traveling .

When traveling in a group , you have to respect other people , and travel the region according to the guide 's plan .
Because of that , even if you really like one place and wants to stay more in the place , you get no luxury to choose whether to move to the other place or to stay in one place .
A good example of this is when you visit Louvre Museum in Paris as a group .
Since Louvre Museum is a gorgeous museum that needs more than a day to see everything , because of the tour guide 's schedule , you have to move to the other place when the time is up , and some tour guides set the time for the Louvre Museum for only few hours , making travellers impossible to see many things from the museum .
On the other hand , traveling in individual grants travelers the most freedom .
The one traveling alone can choose to stay in one region as long as their time allows , and also can skip a place according to his will .
For instance , when an individual traveller finds the Louvre Museum very interesting , he can choose to spend few days for the Museum , skipping his chances to see the other places , such as the Versailles Palace .
Due to that , the person can make and adjust his own schedule to achieve the best pleasure in given time .

Not only achieving freedom , but travelling as an individual can give travellers chance to meet many local people .
Some people might claim that travelling as an individual can make the person unable to find the places that the person wants to go .
However , travelling is not just about seeing places and take pictures .
True meaning of travelling is feeling cultures of places , and meet people and communicate with them .
By doing that , the person can widen his/her view about the world .
Furthermore , if a person cannot reach to the place because he does n't know the way , then he can ask local people using his body languages and gestures .
By doing that , even though the trip might be a little tougher , but the trip will be more meaningful and will help the person to grow mentally .

Many people tend to travel in group because of the various reasons .
One might decides to travel in group because he/she has no time to plan for his own trip .
One might decides to travel in group because he ca n't speak the language of the region .
However , despite of all the disadvantages of travelling alone , Travelling individually will help you to understand better about the culture as well as widening your viewpoints about the world .
Due to that , it is certain that travel as an individual is the best way to travel .
