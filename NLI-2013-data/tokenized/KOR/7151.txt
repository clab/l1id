I strongly agree with that statement .
In thesedays there is a lot of cars .
The number of cars on streets is increasing and we can say each family has at least one car .
But after twenty years I think and I hope that there will be fewer cars than now .
Because twenty years , it might be a short time , but now the speed of develop of science became very fast as well , and I am sure that in our future we will able to do most things of our life and our work at home without moving .
So we will not need the car as so many times as now .
thanks to especially internet now we can do many things at home .
For example we can order some products which we want to buy directly using the e-commerce sites , or we can send a letter using e-mail without going out for post office .

Personally I do n't like driving a car .
I get stressed easily when I must park my car because of absence of free place or when there is a crazy traffic .
In future I believe that there will be new type of transport such as the `` Segway '' which is small , easy and very comfortable .
It needs just the electricity to make it work .
so with introduce of these new transport invention I think we will need less the car .
But I do n't think there will be much fewer cars than now , I immagine that just a bit fewer .
Because twenty years is enough to make a change as I wrote at the begining , but I must say at the same time it 's not so long period .
I will see after twenty years whether my opinion will be right .
