Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Many compnies adveritise in order to make lots of money .
Their purpose is to make money and their purpose is to make the company 's image good on the consumers .

First of all , when I bought the shampoo that was advertised on television seemed so good .
They did show how the hair was shining after they washed their hair .
Thereby , I went to the store and bought one of the shampoo that was advetised .

Unfortunately , for my hair was no good .
It did not make my hair as shining as I expected .
Moreover , it made my hair more oily that I had to wash my hair more often .
I think it was because they used a famous actress that it motivated me more to buy the product .
For instance , this actress is using this product so let me follow her .
In a way , it is like copying .
Also , I made a mistake which that actress might had hair that was perfectly fitted with the shampoo .

Second of all , when they advertise about certain food , it looks more delicious on television .
What I found out from my friend who works in an advertisement company was that she told me they put something inside so it shows more greasy and more colorish .
I did found some food such as frozen food were not that delicious than I had expected .
It all had reasons for it .
Maybe the sound might make advertisements much better than the real product .

I think there are several factors allow products to look good .
First factor was they use an famous actor or actress so people want to use it .
It is more like copying or it is more like this actor is using it so I better use it .
Second factors are sound and backgrounds .
When people advertise they do add some sounds or ingredients so it seems that products look good itself but it is not .
It is the surroundings that make the product good itself .
