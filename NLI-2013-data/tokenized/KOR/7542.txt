I disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually .

First , if you travel in a group led by a tour guide , of course you do n't have to plan for anything because tour guide know everything what to do or where to go .
It saves you time and you do n't have to get stress from planning for trip .
However , when I go somewhere I do n't know very much , I 'd like to research first and study about the place I will go and the language they speak there .
In this process , I will decide where to go and what I want to see during my own research .
Also if you study the language of the country you will go , you do n't have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food .
While you are planning for trip , you already earn so many things and experience .

Second , if you are with the group , you have no choice for what to eat .
You have to eat certain food the tour guide already sets up for the group .
When you travel , you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended .
I am sure tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat , but you have no choice eat something else .
Even for the food , I want to research what is the most popular food in that country and I will figure whether I can eat this food or not .
If not , of course I will look for another place to go .

For the last , traveling is all about the experience the new thing from new world at least I think .
I do n't want to have a same experience what other people have .
With group touring , you have to go same place and take a picture from certain place like others .
Whole group will have same memory from the trip .
I want to build my own memory from expereincing the new world .
