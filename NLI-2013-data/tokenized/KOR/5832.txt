I do not agree with the topic that it will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
Day be day , more and more people want to get a car , and people wish to have their own cars .
It is same to me , too .
I also want to get a car .
There are several reasons to explain that more cars in use that there are today .

Now , enoughly , there are many cars in world .
Actually , I live in Shanghai , China , every morning when I go to school , I always take school bus .
However , everyday if the bus only 5 minutes , it takes over one hour to go to school .
I meant , many people have their own cars .
Also , I wish I have a car .
Because , if I have a car I can go everywhere in free .
Some of my friends have their own car .
Thus , every morning , they go to school by driving their own cars .
Sometimes they come to my house then pick me to school .
I meant , sometimes , I go to school to gether with them .
It is more comfortable than school bus .
By using own car is really comfortable and can move or go somewhere freely .
Thus , i wish to have my own car .

Second , every morning , it is too crowed .
Because in rush hour , many people go to their school or offices , bus or subways are too crowed .
I heard that before , in Seoul or Tokyo , there is a unique job which is called `` Push man '' .
In every rush hour , in bus or subway is too crowed and all people want to them first .
And bus or subway is too small to take all people .
Thus , push man help to people .
Push man push the people before the door is closing .
In human society , people are busy to go to their office , there is unique job too .
Anyhow , if people use thier own car , it is more comfortable to go .
Also , in China the populations are getting increase .
Of course , as the rule of China , there should be only one child , populatins is increasing .
Thus if chinese have their own car , it will be more cars in the future .

In conclude , by using car is more comfortable to go to somewhere and more and more people wish to have thier own car .
Thus , in future , there are more and more cars .
