When it comes to the statement `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' , i always think of my father 's childhood .
Comparing the society when my father was a child and today 's society , I get a feeling that young people in nowadays are too busy with their own works and i often expereince the coldness of people , thesedays .

In my father 's childhood , people were not pressured by time .
He tells me that there were more chances to clean his town and to help old people who were living soley .
However , in our modern society , you can always see young people watching their clocks and running around with a number of heavy bags .
People in today 's world , are working when they should be helping their communities .

My father often reminds me that there were nothing more important than family and neighbour when he was a child .
If one of his neighbours was getting married , all people in his town came to his wedding to celebrate , even the students and the school teachers !
But now , young people do not even have time to celebrate his or her own birthdays .
Therefore , when it comes for young people to help or celebrate other people , they are not so willingful because they hardly ever received these kind of warmness before .

Due to the rapid change of the society , young people have a loads of work to do in stead of helping their communities and young people are losing their friendness when they should be socializing with people in their communities .
May be , it is the time for young people to be relaxed and have a look around them .
