In my opinions , I totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
There are main three reasons : basic , creation , knowledges .

First reason is that when I do something in school , job ans so on , understanding ideas and concepts always can be based for doing it .
For example , when I am working in my job , I got complicate problems , so I am trying to solve by using many ways .
However it is not working , what do I do ?
I need to look over again very carefully and I should understand that problem clearly .
And then I would think about its basically ideas and concepts .
I must try to understand that .
After that I might solve that problem by understanding its ideas and concepts .
Therefore , when I do whatever , understanding ideas and concepts is really important .

Second reason is that understanding ideas and concepts can improve my creation abilities and thinkings .
If I just do something without thinking or understanding , it can be mixed up and I cannot get good achivements .
Maybe I just would work , such as machines .

Therefore , if I allways try to understand ideas and concepts , it can improve my creation ablities and thinkings , so I would do greatly .
Final reason is that I can get many background knowledges by understanding ideas and concepts .
To live in society , all people need variety background knowledges as well as many experiences .

To understand ideas and concepts of something what I want to get , I should try to study its basically ideas and concepts , also I need to look for many things , such as books , articles to understand .
As I study like this , I can get many knowledges more and more .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is really good to get background knowledges .

In conclusion , according to these reasons , I totally agree with that understanding ideas and concepts is very important to improve myself by these reasons above lists .
