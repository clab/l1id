As the technology kepp developing , now days , people watching television a lot .
In the television , they are able to get some information .
Many women watching shopping chennel .
However , the company , they advertised their products seem the way better than what it really does .

Normally , women are go to shoppingor watching somthing kind of shopping chennel .
Therefore they buy many things from shopping chennel .
But they usually get disappoint , becuase the product was not good engough as from advertisement .
In additionaly , consequently , they call to the company to pay back .

It is the one of way to they ( company ) sell their products .
They make advertisements that make products seem much better .
Also I 'd experience this .
About 6 years ago , in television , it advertised a thing that is able to clean up dirty things on shirt .
My mom thought that is remarkable idea , so she bought it .
Consequently , she disappointed that product .
It did n't work as it does from an advertisement .

My father is a professor in university and majored ` Department of Communication ' or something related to advertisement .
I ask my father that `` why they ( company ) are making an advertisement that make their products seem like good ? ''
He said that is the one of the ways to they sell it , to make benefits for them .

Also there are many things that are working , but mostly , the products are not workig good enoguth than what it showed from an advertisement .
