There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years later surely .
Nowadays , there are trends not having any cars , encouraging the use of public transportation , and the attempts to invent more effective transportation .
It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jamming , environment pollution and lacking of oil .

First of all , one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jam on our roads is incredibly severe now .
In some countries like Korea , the land are very densely populated , there are excessive cars on the road , there happens the traffic jamming even on the highway road .
Not only for Korea , it is the worldwide problem .
Many country are suffering from traffic jam .
government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jam .

And one other problem as serious as above is the environmental thing .
Car causes pollution in many ways , most seriously , the engine gas of cars make the sky foggy and dirty .
It causes contagious eye diseases , and respiratory problems .
In adittion , it promotes the global warming which is making mankind very afraid of .
The carbon dioxide in the engine gas make the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth .
And then the water level uprises and covers available land of us .
Maybe we lose our whole earth to live .
If cars wo n't decrease , there will happen a crisis of the entire human race .

Moreover , the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now , and in about 40 years , there will be no oil to depend on .
in present point of view , we ca n't live without oil and gas .
They are used to make fabrics , circulating plants and factories , and more and more .
If we use all of them driving car , the thing will happen a lot sooner .
So till we have a great resource to replace oil and gas , we should try to save it and invent other kind of transportions which are not taking any oil .

In the points of view above , there are too many problms with abundance of cars .
So for people to live , in the global view , they will not have cars .
Ultimately we will be able to see not jamming roads and clearer sky with fewer cars in the road .
