I agree with this statement that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities based on my experience .

First of all , for a period of time , educaters or parents do not give enough ecouragement to young people of the importance of contributing to communites .
For example , high school or junior high school students are only pressured by school work such as homework .
Therefore , they do not have an opportunities to learn the importance of giving others like doing a volunteer work for the poor or old citizen in our society .

This phenomenon continues when they grow up and become a university student .
During this period , they are apt to feel much pressure caused by their future career .
This concern results in that students become selfish and only pursue their own interests for their sake .
They learn only how to compete each other and seek for the methods how they can be successful as soon as possible .
They do not have chances to think about what they gain from community they are living .

Furthermore , there is another serious problem that causes this phenomenon .
For a decade , there are increasing numbers of people who go abroad to study or immigrate to a foreingn country .
It means that the community is threatend by decreasing numbers of people who would forget to contribute to their society .

Lastly , there are a diversity of entertaining activities that would attract young people .
There exist a tons of movie theaters , shopping malls , restaurants and bars for young people to enjoy and spend their time .
They are just hectic to spend their free time in enjoying their hobbies with friends with various fun activities .
Who would want to do a volunteer work for other people or be concous of how their community is going in their busy lives ?

These three reasons make me think that young people are not contributing to their society enough and appreciating their community .
