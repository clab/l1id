Although it 's essential to have a car these days , it seems to be hader and harder to afford and causes many enconveniance to those who own a car .
it 's not only because the money but also for enconvineance that people encounter so I think that in twenty there will be less cars in use then today .

Firstly , Oli price has gone up so high in past few years and it became big problem not only for the drivers but also to the economy .
I remember when I first started driving in 5 years ago .
It wa n't cheap but it was still ok for the convinence that I got from driving cars but when I go to the gas station to fill the tank now , it cost almost double than what it used to be .
Because of it I try to use public transportation when I go to school instead of driving .

Secondly , nowadays one family owns more than one car so there are so many cars and there are n't enough space for parking .
Especially Korea , which is very small with high papularity , it is a huse problem now .
When people get back from work at night they have to have another `` War '' to find a spot to park .
It is very annoying because you are already near home but ar n't able to go home because you ca n't find a parking apot .

To conclude , having car is not as good as what it used to be , people will decide not to have a car or have less cars in the future .
I think that to solve that the problems above people will buy more bycicles or motor-bike in the future .
It cost less money and more convineant than having a car .
When people start buying them instead of buyinh cars , the number of cars will gradually decrease .
