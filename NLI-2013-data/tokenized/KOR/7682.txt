Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide beause of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide .
Both ways of this argument have advantages .
However I would side with that best way to travel is alone without tour guide because of free and beneficial experience .
Now then I wll present this opinion by considering these two advantages .

On the one hand , traveling with a group led by tour guide might be said to cause advantages .
On top of that if people travel with their guide they enjoy their tour conveniently .
In other words the schedule is already settig so people just travel without thinking such as where I am and then and so on .
In addition the tour guide give the tour information whenever people travel about there information .
when I was in high school I travel America led by tour guide the tour guide makes my family feel convenience .

On the other hand , .
travelig alone without tour guide would give many advantages .
Firstly , if people travel alone they enjoy free and without inference and they can wander anywhere that they want .
If oppurtunity to travel is given to me I want to travel swiss that I want to go .
Secondly , trveling alone is good choice by experience directly .
In other words this is useful to social peronrelationship and social experience .
So traveling is very good .

All thihs considered , two way is both best way .
however I think that traveling is more beneficial and the best way .
That 's because free is more important to me that convenience led by tour guide .
Eventually , I thik that the best way to travel is alone .
