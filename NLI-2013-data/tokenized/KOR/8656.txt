In Korea , students who are before entering a university should memorize most of evrrything to prepare the test of university .
Why should hey do memorize everything ?
I think understanding those and experiance are more important than just learnig .
There are some reasons .

First of all , If students just memorize idea and comcepts fot theit goals such as entering a university , getting a job , and graduation , will they remember it long time ?
I think the answer is `` NO '' .
Because thier ultimate goals are not learnig and understanding for themselves .
Thus , they just have studied to enter a university and if they enter a university , they will forget it eaily because they got thier goal yet .

Second , if student do n't understand ideas and concepts , those will be furtile .
It is because although they study those , they did n't try to understand ideas .
If they did n't understand , will they use the knowleadge ?
and then can we call that is `` Knowleadge '' ?
The learnig that is not be understanded is just waste .
I think rather that not to know those better than it .

Finally , in Korea , there are a few exentric school now .
Those are same other school to learn .
However , the style of study is different .
It is that their lessons are focused by understanding study .
So , sometimes they go out to learn in class time .
They experiance and understand everything so accumulate those .
As a result , the students of the school enter a university easier than ordinary school .

This tell us that understand is more impr

In conclusion , if students try to understand ideas and concepts , actually they should spend time long .
However , the effort of them will appear clrealy and develop themselves more .
