Some people might think learning fact is more important than understanding ideas and concept .
However , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

First , It may not all that you are seeing .
For example , There are so many movies out there such as Charley Chaplin who made very famouse movie and history of movie , and you might think that movie is stupid and just funny but nowadays people ca n't deny that It is one of the best movie so far .
Because He representitive that generation with the funny behaviers and people understood what he wants to express of that movie .
So umderstanding is very important .

moreover , It 's not worth it even though you see somthing ans if you do n't understand the idea .
When I see the Prida Callo 's self - portrait , I thought it 's so aufull becaus there is not even any human 's face and there is only blood and animals .
But after I learned to understand ideas and cocept , I totally agree and satisfied with her art wark .
If people see only facts , they will miss so many beautifu and sifnificant things in their life .

Finally , Think about seeing disabilities .
Even though they ca n't see at facts at all , they feel everything .
So , I realized the facts are just part of our a

Cleary , I stronly believe that understanding ideas and cocepts for discovering inportant meaning which is hided and have acknowlege to enjoy our life .
