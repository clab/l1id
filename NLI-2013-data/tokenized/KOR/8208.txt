In classes , students learn not only the facts but also the `` ideas '' or `` concepts '' that can be pulled out from the fact .
I strongly agree the statement that it is more improtant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

FIrst , diffrent from learning only facts , if we understand ideas and concepts throughly , we can apply the knowledge to our life .
For example , if we only know the fact that Franklin D. Roosevelt built New Deal in history , it 's just the fact as it is .
But if we understand how and why Franklin D. Roosevelt built New Deal policy and how it effected to American reneissance , we can apply to our life as we change ourselves as Roosevelt changed his country step by step in history .
We can be impressed and motivated by understanding details about FDR 's New deals and accepted him as American hero .
Like the exampels , learning the fact is not enough to challenge ourselves .
we have to throughly understand what ideas or concepts the text book provides .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will create a new fact that can be the great resources for the future .
We have to learn from history , and prepare for future .
If one have ideas and concepts from history , it can be reformed to more innovative ideas and concepts .
For example , Lots of designers read many articles and magazines and see pictures from design book and try to immitate it .
If they stop trying in the moment they just saw other designer 's ideas , the design will stay as it is now .
But from the past design , designers rethink about it and create a novel complete ideas from it .
ThIs is how the design was developed and will be developed in the future .
As i indicate in a example of design , understanding the a idea or concept is the first step to remodel and develop this world .
We have to accept the ideas or concepts from resourses the world has now , and recreate it with more imagination and sophistication .

Because of this two reason , i belive understainding ideas and concepts is much more important than just knowing facts from text .
To develop oursevles and the world , we have to pay attention more to `` ideas '' and `` concepts '' rather than facts .
