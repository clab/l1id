As consumers live in the society of advertisements , they see abundant of commercial advertisements .
And they often face the situation when the quality of the products does not meet their expectation made by the advertisements , because It is natural that the advertisements make products look much better that they really are .

It is a given characteristic of the commercial advertisements to maximize the positive sides of the products and to minimize or even hide the negative sides of the products .
And this process will alter the impression of the consumers toward the products .

For example , the advertisements of fastfood restaurants such as McDonald 's or Burgerking , do not mention about their nutrition facts .
Not because they do not know about it , but because they know it will harm the image of their food products .
They mostly try to show how delicious the burgers are .
And without getting all the bad informations about the products , consumers , of course , think the products are much better than they actually are .

Also , the media take influential role in this process .
There are limitations for consumers to analyze the products .
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the products in short period of time while advertisements are on the media , and also because they are indirect way to show the products , consumers just cannot get correct impressions of the products from the advertisements .
And surely , it leads to the misleading of the impression about the products , usually to exaggerated ways .

Psychological factors of the advertisements are also worth to discuss .
As consumers look at the advertisement of the body spray `` TAG '' , they get the notion that anybody who sprays the `` TAG '' will attract numerous beautiful females .
By showing that one who uses `` TAG '' can attract numerous females in the advertisements , the company tries to give consumers an impression that `` TAG '' is attractive , and effective body spray .
Although there is n't too much of a difference between `` TAG '' and other body sprays , this advertisement make consumers to think that `` TAG '' is better than other body sprays .

So , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
