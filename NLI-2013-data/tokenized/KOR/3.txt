Most people are considering which is better for them between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and having knowledge in one specific subject .
Some people say that having knowledge in one specific subjet is more useful for people , because they can study much deeply about a certain subject .
However , I strongly claim that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is much better .
That 's because it is easy for you to talk with many people about diverse subjects and you can look more intelligent than any other person .

First of all , if I have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , there are many common talking subjects with others .
That means , I can easily get closed to other people .
When people share their thoughts about common things , they easily get closed .
From my personal experience , one of my friends , soccer player , who well knows only about soccer , always used to talk about soccer .
Whenever we met , he talked how to play soccer and there are many soccer rules which you do not know yet .
As time goes by , I became to deny him .
In this repect , having broad knowledge of many academic is better than having knowledge in a certain subject .

On top of that , a person who having broad knowledge of many academic looks more intelligent person .
If I have knoledge only in one specific subject , I can expalin about that part very well .
However , I can not speak confidently about other areas .
My cousins are good example to expain this .
One cousin studied very well and bacame a doctor .
The other studied not well , but he tried to learn knowledge of many areas .
He also changed his job many times .
A few days ago , we gathered to see and talked about many things .
As the topics are changing , the cousin who have broad knowlege of many academic subjects gave me many advices and expained about whatever I did not exactly know .
However , the other did not say much to me except for one subject , medical problems .

In conclusion , I believe that having broad knowledge is much better because it help for you to get closed with others and to look more intelli
