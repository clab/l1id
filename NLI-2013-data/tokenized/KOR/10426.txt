There are two kinds of people of working on the world .
One kind of people is trying new thinkgs and the another kind of people is not trying new thing just only doing what they already been doing .
Most of people want to be successful people .
But it is too hard to be that people .
If you want to be successful people you 'd better try new things .
There are three things that are help to understand to my opinion .

First .
the world is fast changing what we can not see its changing .
For example , 20years ago , did we know about computer 's technology such as e-mail , game , and fax .
But what about now ?
We usually use computer when we are working .
If i did n't know computer 's technolohy , we would spend much time than before .
As you know , we should learn about how to use computer and try it .

Second , we know somebody who is already successful and they try new thinkgs .
As you know , the presdent of MS ( micro soft ) who is the best bussiness man in the world and best rich .
According to some researcher , he always try new things .
If he did n't try think about PC ( Persnol Coputer ) , we would n't use PC now .
Another person is Bush who is presdent of U.S .
He try to make great conutry .
He always think that how to be U.S stronger than now .
Most of American think he is a great presdent .

Third , somebody who is not trying new things can not improve anymore .
Of course , they are professional in their major .
However .
can they follow the changing of world ?
They did n't know about that .
They did n't get new ideas from experiense of new things .

Finally , new things can show me new idea .
Sometimes it will be able to give fail to us .
But we should keep trying new things .
Do you want to be successful ?
Try it and get great ideas .
