I absolutely agree that ` Most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . '

I confront the bundle of advertisement on the TV , radio , bus , and even along the wall and on the road .
The food In the advertisement loosks more eligible , so I feel that I have to eat that .
How about the facial cosmetic ?
Its effect is significant so that I ca n't resist to try it .
The advertisement of diet is incredible .
It shows even the pictures of the ` before ' and ` after ' using their products .

Is it real ?
I do n't think so .
The answer is clear if you use those products .
I tried foods , cosmetics , and ` incredible ' diet drugs .
Nothing is like the advertisement .
I mean that the food does n't taste great for me to make a smile , and the cosmetic that I chose among the advertisements did n't give my face enough moisture .
As for the drug for diet , it really did not lost my weight .
Far from my experience , the people around me and my neighbor gave the similar experience to me .
There is no BIG change such as the advertisement .

Even the surface of the package is n't like the contents in the view of color or shape .
How shame on them !
I 'm so sensitive consumer to try the weight of the purchase on the scale .
It did n't match exactly .

I showed the case of exaggerated advertisement based on my own experience .
In order consumers ' to make a right decision , it is important to show the way the products are as well as to deliver the consumers ' report to the public .
