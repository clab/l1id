The question states that , thesedays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with this statment .
Thesedays , i think because young people do not mind that , if their community gets risk or something not like old people .
Actually they do not think their rights to do for their community , People have right to vote , paying tax , In korea , men have to go to army .
but some young people do not give to helping their community .

Firstly , Young people do not go for voting for their community , They go for a trip or abroad instead , or some people go to migration to other country , so then they do not participate their community eventhough they have a right to vote .
Therfore the less people is vote for their community and they get unsatisfaction their head of community .

Secoundly , Youn people do not pay their tax to their community .
so then the community cannot operate their work for the community .
young people donot mind about the community .

Finally , In korea , men have to go to army when they over 20 years old , but some tuong people go to migration to ecape from the government that try to catch him because he does not go to army .
or sometimes they are try to get ill , so then they would not go to army .
It is being the most big problem in korea .

I agree that the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It should be changed , and then all of the communitie can operate better .
