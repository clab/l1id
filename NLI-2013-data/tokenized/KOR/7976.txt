When people go to travel , some people llike to travel with their own plan while others prefers to travel with a tour guide .
A trip with tour guides provide a convenient journey in that they provide much information about the places and planned sechedule , however , I do not think the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .
In my opinion , to travle with our own plan is more exciting experience because I can go to the places where I can want to go and I can enjoy a trip with my friends .

If I plan my trip schedules , I can go anywhere I really want to go .
In case of traveling with a group led a tour guide , I should go to the places where I really want to go , However , If I am placed in the center in my travel , I do not need to waste time to look and work around which I do not interested in .
With my flexible schedules I can enjoy more my trip .
Moreover , scheduleing my travel plans is quite exciting and from doing that , I can get some useful information about the traveling places .

In addition , in case of traveling with a group by a tour guide , I should get along with other people participated in the trip .
However , I do not really want to enjoy with them and there are some people who are interfere the trip with their own convenience .
I never want to be interfered with those situations because I really wish to enjoy my trip and also have a opportunity of takeing some breaks from hard work in school , stressing out , and refreshing my self .

To travel is a exciting and so memorable experience .
Since I do not be involved in such situations which I really want to and I hole to enjoy my trip fully , I prefer traveling with my own planning .
