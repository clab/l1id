I used to like to go travel and almost my travel was followed a tour guide .
Even though I was very young I did n't want to having time with a tour guide because it was very uncomprotable for me .
I actually wanted having only our family .
So most of time I felt if I grow up in the future , I will go travel by myself .
Then dreams came ture .
When I became adult , I went to trip only me and my friend .
Throught that travel , I realized that traveling by my self is much better to see everywhere and without a guide trip made me a feeling of freedom travel , many experiences , and making new friends .

First of all , I could feel like freedom without a guide because I could visit more many places which is not expensive but more beautiful .
However , if I go travel with a guide , I can go only limited place and I will not feel trip , I will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone .

Second , I will get variety experiences .
If I go to French ,

Third , I can make new overseas friends .
Actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem .
However , it could be chance to contect new people .
If I do n't feel dangerous or scared , I can have a question to native poeple .
Also it will help me to go more general place , which means native 's usual place , or if my new friends come to my contry , I will help them , either .

In short , I prefer to trip without a tour guide because I do n't want to
