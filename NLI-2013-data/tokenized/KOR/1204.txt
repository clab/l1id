Have you ever heard about the word like `` Pal-bang-mi-in '' ?
This word is from Korea , and it means that good at a lot of things .
As we can know that old saying , the society prefer to be good at many things rather than good at only one thing .
There are three reasons that why we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

First of all , various knowledge make people can talk with others freely and flexible .
If someone specialize in one specific things , he cannot talk with other things freely .
For example , I am a person who has lots of interst with only reading books , and do not have any time to watch a TV .
However , when my friends start to talk with TV programs , or movie star , I cannot join with them .

Secondly , it can help you to understand many things at once .
Considering only one thing cannot help people to think other things .
However , when you know even a little part of a broad knowledge with others , it can help you to know how others going on .
Also , you can know that the progress of the society or other things .

Lastly , you can learn many things easily as many as possible based on the broad knowledge .
When you know about a little in something , you already know the basic of those things , and know how they organized , so you might know the direction of their ways .
However , if you do not know about some materials even a little , then you have to start to know those things from the beginnig , and it will be harder than start with basic knowledge .

To sum up , I would recommand that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
It can help us to have conversation with others freely and flexible , understand many things at once , and learn many things easily as many as possible compared knowing nothing .
It is a real information age nowadays , and we do not need to specialize in one specific subject any more .
The age changed , and we should change to know broad things and start with get broad knowledge .
