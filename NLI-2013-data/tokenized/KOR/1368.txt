In my opinion , being an specialist in specific subject is much more important than having a broad knowledge .
That 's because Modern society wants specialist .
At the previous time , such as 19 century , slight and broad information about all range of academic subject would make out efficient solution and perspective view of the problem .
But the world has changed .
We can get that kind of knowledge in internet , very easily .
It 's not wealth anymore .
So , having a normal knowledge about all over the academic subject can not makes you a needed person .

When you were teenager , school ( or teacher ) teaches you all kind of subject such as English , Mathmatics , Biology , Art , etc .
But when you get in to University , you have to choose your major and study deeply in that parts .
Why the education programme is changed general things to specific thing ?
University makes a leader not a just normal citizen .
When you roll as a leader , you need a specialized knowledge about your major .

The society goes to diversity , they need an specialist on several parts to solve complexe probleme .
So the importance of specialist is emphrased .
If you want to be a needed person , you have to study your own subject , and be specialist .
That way will make you wealth people .
