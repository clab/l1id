I disagree with the state , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are so many cars which are inventing , as the year passes by there are more people who has cars , and in our society we can not live without cars .

There are so many cars which are invented and will continue to invent for the future because every year people are born and that means more cars will be made .
There are people who works for the car company , such as Sam Sung in Korea .
Sam Sung is mainly producing cars and everyday they are inventing a new car with new colors , design , and shapes .
Each year people buy new cars because it attracts them and they do not keep their cars for many years .
In certain time they all change into new cars .
If there are no people buying cars then the people who works for the car company will all loose the job .

As the year passes by there are more people who has cars becuase everyone wants to have independent car .
As people grow older they all want to have their own car , house , and family .
These days , everyone is educated that means they are smart , everyone has a job and they can afford to buy a car .

Lastly in our society we can not live wiout cars because of our own social life and independence .
Most people use their car to jobs , school or for family .
Most people wants to have their own car to go to work or do personal stuff rather than riding public transportation because it is comfortable riding their own cars , they can go or do whatever they want , and what if their house is far away form the city and no public transportation going to their own house .
These days people have another house to relax and calm down which are far away form the city .

Therefore , because of incrising of population , attractiveness of cars , and personal life , cars will still remain and more cars will come after unless the earth does not exsist .
