People normally think that people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well can have succeful life .
However , I think that it is really dangerous thinking and I strongly disagree with this .
There are three main reasons and examples why I disagree with the statement .

First , it has really low percentage of success .
When people try new things there are always a lot of risk .
Since new things are not known and proved the people always take the risks .
And sometimes it can be really dangerous for the people .
If what the people try to do is succeed , then he/she can be a hero and others may respect them .
However , that does not normally happen in our lives .
So it can be really dangerous for you to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you know how to do well .
For example , if you work for a company and you need to finish your project .
Then you do not follow the standard guide lines and you try a new way to do the project .
If your boss like the project , that is really lucky and good for you but normally that is really hard .
You might get fired because of your new way to do the project .

Second , the statement seems right because there are some people who have become famous because of their new thinkings and tries .
However , it is really rare situation .
Only few people actually succeed by their new ideas and unusual tries .
Then They look really good because they can be famous .
For example , Novel became really famous by making dinamites .
He tried new thinngs and finally invented really useful equipment .
But if he failed his work , no one would know him thesesdays .
Only when you succeed your try , people will respect you and remember you .
Otherwise , you fail your work and no one cares about it .

Third , you can still succeed even though you do not try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you already know how to do well .
Success does not always require your new attempt .
Success is just depends on your personal values .
For example , if your value is earning money and having a nice family , you do not have to try new things and face risks .
You can still have successful life without any new tries .
Success deals with your personal values much more than what you actually do .

As above , the percentage of success is really low when you try knew things , and it is really hard to succeed by doing new thing .
Also you can still succeed even though you do not try new things rather than onlu doing what you already know how to do well .
Therefore , I disagree with the statement .
