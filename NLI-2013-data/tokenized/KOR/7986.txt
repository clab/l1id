People have different opinions whether traveling with group and guide is good way or not .
I strongly believe that travel is in a group with tour guide is more beneficial because we can save time and money and also that is safety .
Let me explain for supporting my opinions .

First of all , traveling with tour guide who is already know about travel place allow us to save time and money .
Even though some people worry about tight schedule of group tour , I think that economical advantage is eclipse the weak point .
For example , suppose that you travel around where you have never been before , you might be lost road and you do n't know where is best place for traveling .
So you need to solve the problems .
Considering limit time on unknown place , all of things you face with problems is waste of time and money .
If you travel with tour guide , you could less the heavy problems and you could save time and money because guide will lead where they already know and where is best place for travel .

Next , travel with group and guide allow us to safety .
Although that is unappealing when it comes to challenging aspects , in strange area , the most important thing is safety .
For example , If I go to where I have never been before , there are possibilities to be exposed to dangerous things .
Without assistance of tour guide , I could not avoide that .
In addition , as I include in group , I feel more comfortable and stable because there is less chance to be a suspects ' target .
If I really want to challenge in other countries , I would like to travel where I have already been .
Therefore , as far as I concerned , keeping my self is the prioty thing for traveling .

In conclusion , I prefer to travel with others because of saving time and money , and also I am worried about my safety .
Moreover , in circustance under safety , I can really enjoy for traveling .
