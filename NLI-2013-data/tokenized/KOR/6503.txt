Although peole may think that there will be more cars in the world as the years go by , I hold a different view .
I strongly believe in 20 years , there will be fewer cars in use due increasingly high-maintance costs and better alternatives .

First of all , I hold this opinion because I believe that the increasingly high - maintance cost of cars will discourage people to drive cars .
During the past few years the oil prices have increased more than two-fold , which is making it difficult and unreasonable to keep up with automobile maintance expenses .
Although , having the luxury of driving and owning your car may seem more glamorous , it just ist'n practicable nor reasonable anymore .
As such more and more people are being discouraged to use cars .

In addition , I believe that there will be fewer cars 20 years from now due to the fact that people now have better alternatives for transportation .
30 years ago , using a car was essential , as a means of transportaion .
If you needed to go on a business trip or visit family , there was not much alternative methods .
However , nowadays , a car is n't the only method of going somewhere , there are various alternatives .
In places like New York or Hong Kong , you really do n't need a car to move around , you can use the subway or buses as your main means of transportaiton .
These days , in the major cities of the world , I believe rather than owning and driving your own car , it is more wiser to use public transportaion .

In summation , due to surging oil prices and reasonable alternatives , I would have to diagree with the statement .
Though driving your car , whether it is on a date or to work may have many benefits , I do not believe those benifits will out weigh the rational of choosing a different means of transportation .
