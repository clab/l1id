As far as I am concerned , the best way to travel is free tour .
In other words , I think not planned tour will give us more pleasant experience .
You may argue that the group tour led by an adept tour guide can show us more things to see and feel , but it is just a second-hand experience just given away to our hand by another person .

In my case , I am planning New york tour after two weeks .
I 've saved my spare pocket money and earned money from part time jobs for two years .
I prepared sightseeing visa and flight tickets just on my own without any help from tour agency .
It gave me a self-confidence that I can do anything for myself .
It was a little bit hard job to prepare document for applying visa and cheapest flight ticket , but I think it reserved thing to do .
You can save your time to prepare your travel with agency and skillful guide , but you cannot get a experience to do something on your own .

Moreover , self planned travel can gives you a great experience differ from a group tour have to obey time table scheduled by tour agency or gude .
The people who went to trip with guide can see famous tourist attractions and get a same memory with others , but tourist without guide will go anywhere want to go even if it was not a planned thing to do .
The plan-less trip can give us real freedom because no plan is our plan .

I think Many tourist commit oblivion to get freedom .
Our own intend to travel is feel free and experience exotic culture , but many group tour is not available to feel freedom but just crammed exotic culture .
Therefore I think travel with no guide will be better for our independence and more experience .
