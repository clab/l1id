Some people might say that for the students it is more crucial to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
However , I ptrfer to choose with the formal since the students are learning their subjects based on facts from the school .
Firstly , a lot of adults are trying to teach and give them only the right factors without any explanations .
For instant , Whenever I had learned something from the school I did not understand the parts of ideas and concepts on something but the teachers tought me the facts not the real ideas of the problem .
So it was really hard for me to understand of my study and improve my studying skills .
Also I was not even able to concentrate on the other parts .

On the other hand knowing only facts could be easier but unuseful and does not make more sense .
In addition , for the learners make them to understand more ideas and concepts are much better and they can feel more security .

To sum up , as I said above , in my case telling kids the ideas and concepts are more critical than just let them know the facts .
Because students have to have their own rights to think about some facts and should able to catch their abilities as well as human 's freedom .
