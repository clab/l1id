It is often said that these days , youth do not allocate enough time to helping other people .
I highly support this idea because today 's society more weighs another values , such as personal skills and ability to win the brutally competition and youth also are more individualistic than the past .

First of all , contemporary society prefers competitive warriors to warm-hearted ordinary people .
In other words , People in modern society must win their enemies in thier field to succeed .
There is no place for humanism such as helping others in this situation .
For example , When I was a university student , volunteer works in agricultural town still were popular .
However , nowadays that volunteer program are abolished because most of the student do n't apply .
These days , a large number of students are very busy to prepare exam such as English fluency test or computer ability test .
That 's because that exams are helpful for their future career and job recruiting .

Moreover , nowadays , young people are more affected by individualism .
They more weigh benefit of them than value of whole society .
For instance , 1980's korean university student councils were dominated by people who affected by socialism and communism .
However , 2000's korean university student do n't interested that value .
They more concentrated their own ability and entertainment .

As shown above , these days , youth do n't invest their time for their communities .
That 's because sociey has changed and people themselves are also changed .
