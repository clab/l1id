Some people say that most adverisements make products seem much better than they really are while other people think that most advertisements do not show products 's rearlity .
The opinion vaires from person to person .
I shall present argument favoring the former statement and refuting the latter statement .

First of all , most advertisers use technical skills to show advantage of products .
While they use technical skills such as photoshop , powverpoint and so on , they focus on showing products 's strongness .
For exmple , if MP3 player is a good desgine instead of funcution and voice quality , the advertisers try to maximimise a desigine .
When people think a desigine is importnat , they want to buy good desing 's products Second , most advertisements attract customer to buy products .
Althought products are not good , good adverisements give customers a strong effect .
While advertisement show their products thought TV , people will see the advertisement and remember the products .
Most adverisers do not care quality , becuse they can cover disadvantages thought adertisements .

In short , many adverisers are able to appear much better than they really are .
Because they try to show product 's strongness .
