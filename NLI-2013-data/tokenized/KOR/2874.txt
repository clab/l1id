I definitely disagree with it .
For the most people , youth is not a time for personal enjoyment for one 's life but a period to thrive themselves desperately to accomplish stability in their later life .

In today , almost every country in the world has a system of capitalism .
As we know , a society can never make the fair distribution of wealth under this system .
Of course , some people might can acieve stability by getting money or fame earlier than others , but they can also lose this easily by various unlucky events .

Also , many young people ( usually teenagers ) have many limits on enjoying their lives .
For instance , they can neither smoke nor drink , they have to follow their school 's order as a student , and they are forced to learn more and more which they regard as an unnecessary thing .

Increase of population gives a big impact on this , too .
Since many young people are thriving to get an accomplishment of their learning , it is impossible for them to compete with each other .
Increasing population makes this tremendously harder .
