It is arguable that which is better to have broad knowledge of many academic fields or to have specific knowledge of one subject deeply .

I agree that it is better to have broad areas of many academic subjects .
In my case , I am studying international studies .
International studies contains many areas such as international politics , international law , diplomacy , international political economy , peacekeeping , security , international organizations like the United Nations and foreign policies of many countries .
I should know these all of areas , even I can not know deeply .

Meanwhile some people believe that it is better to have specific knowledge in one subject insist knowing deeply in one subject is more important than knowing broadly , because if someone needs to master one area of studies , he/she should have backgrounds and history of this subject first , then start to absorb all chapter of this specific subject .
In that someone can be said he/she is master of this subject .

However , even people who believe that it is better to specialize in one specific suject , they should study outside areas of their subjects to need to understand their own subject easily .
Moreover , the knowledge becomes clear after touching broad areas .
Sometimes one or more theories can not be understood at once with these own theories .
Those must be dealt with other theories from different fields .

Basically , the most of studies are connected in similar areas , so it can not be considered and understood seperately .
For instance , interior design , it is connected with arts and architectures .
If interior designer does not aware the base of them subject , he/she can do his/her works .
It means that designer should know about the colors and structures of buildings to achieve his/her works .

To sum up , it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than specific knowledge , even it needs more deepen understanding sometime .
