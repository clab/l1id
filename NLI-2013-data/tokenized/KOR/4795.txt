Nowadays , we can see a lot of advertiments in everywhere .
So , we can get some information about the products which are advertised by their companies .
Some people say that because of the advertisements we can attain much information which is helpful us .
However , i do n't agree with them .
Advertisements have several bad effects because the products are not same as what are advertised .

I have one experience .
When I was high school student , I watched a television in my home .
Suddeny , I saw a advertiment on TV .
It was a IBM computer .
When it comes to computer , IBM was second to none .
I believed tha comapany .
Also , at that time my computer was broken ; so , i needed a new computer .
It looked so great .
On the advertisement i could see that it was very new computer , perfect conditions for game , free print machine , perfect after service , fast delivery .
Therefore , I called the number and I bought .
I thought it will be deliverd in a week ; but , after 3week it arrived .
That was just beginning .
When I got the computer , I could hardly find the printer .
So , I called to the company and protested .
Yet , they just said that they choose some people and they got the printers .
Worse is that the computer was not so good to play games what I had wanted .
Lastely , after service was the terrible .
one month after purchase my computer had some problem .
So , I asked after service .
When I bought the computer that told me that all of after service would free .
In contrast , they required 100 $ for repair fee .
They just said that the service days were over .

That was my story .
Some advertisemnts are same as they really are .
But , some are not .
We have to think and make sure one more time to believe advertisemnts .
The best way is that companies advertise just real not exggaeration and then we trust the companies .
