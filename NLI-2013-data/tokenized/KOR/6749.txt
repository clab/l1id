Basically , I disagree the idea that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
For starters , there has been a countinous increase in demand for cars since car was invented .
because it is a very simple and effective mean to transport something or to move from place to place .
And second , cars have been evolved so fast .
Manufacture of the car has been considered as a very lucrative business that many coporates are spending enormous amount of money on developing , manufaturing and launching the state-of-the-are cars equipped with new features .
By doing that , they are making more consumers want their cars and keeping people to spend thier money on cars .
And this business is going to stay lucrative for a long time .
because like country in Korea , govenment is also investing a lot of money on car manufaturers like Hyundai since it was one of the businesses that has great effect on korean economy .
Plus , as population increases and as they gets more affluent , they want nicer cars .
for some people , It is a mean of showing off thier wealth .
they like to drive expensive cars and enjoy the attention on them .
and It will probably countinue to be like that for a long time .

but there 's still a question ; `` how about fuel ? '' gasolines may disappear in the near future and we 're running out of fossil fuel .
but alternative energy source will be invented also in the near future like hydrogen or solar energy , which is free from pollution .

it is not the kind of thing will be changed in twenty years .
