I agree with the statement .
With the advent of industrialised society , people are getting more and more immersed in their own business not having time to look back and around their community .
In this circumstances , coming generations are more accustomed to this trend of society focusing on their own things .
Industry also reflect this personally oriented trend in their products , like personal computer and mp3 players .
This personalized products encourage peoples ' mind to care their own self .

The style of housing also affect the mind of people , especially condominium in urban areas blocks people having conversation with neighbors and it 's structure hinder contact with neighbors .

Also at home , parents have little time and interest to educate them of altruistic mind .
They are busy in their own life to live .
This can lead young people think only about themselves and have no concern to other people .

These and other factors influence young people uninterested in their surroundings .

Young peole are typically keen on what they are pursuing and what they are wanting .
And they concentrate on what they favor .
We can see this case in computer games .
Some young people play the game to the end of his life not feeling time to have rest , because they are so immersed in the game .

What modern let
