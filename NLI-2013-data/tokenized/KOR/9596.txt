I agree with that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreday know how to do well .
Many people of successful in business have a goal like bid dream .
Because of that they knew how exciting when got tha goal from before success .
Therefore , they need to feel more exciting and advanture things .
There are two examples why they need more and what they have differ than others who is not successful person .

First of all , they have more confidence about everything .
Because they have many experience than others .
Beside they have pride also .
Therefore , they really want to win in business in other hand they rearlly hate lose from somebody .
This is morovating them to try and try .

Second , they realized this `` no pain no gain '' therefore , they can accept many kind of risks to get their business like more money .
There are no money and no success without risk and danger .
They knew this fact , it makes success them in society .
In conculsion , successful people try new thing and take risks due to get more success and money .
