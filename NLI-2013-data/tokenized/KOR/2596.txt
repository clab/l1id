Do young people enjoy life more than older people ?
I believe the answer is `` No '' .
I believe both young and older people can enjoy their lives equally , however , the ways of enjoying the life are quite different .

Young people tend to enjoy their lives from activies which older people cannot handle very well .
For example , young people like to party alot .
They drink , dance , and hang out with their friends all night long .
This is one way of young people to appriciate their healthest time in their lives .
Also , some other young people like to play sports , games , and music .
For example , I am in a band and I play guitar .
I love to play my guitar with my band .
We `` rock and roll '' with music we play .

On the other hand , older people enjoy life by walking a park , hiking , or chatting with their friends .
As I observe my grandparents it seems like older people enjoy beautiful environments such as sound of a bird or color of the sky .
They take the advantage of the environment to the fullest .
OIder people appriciate the beautiful Mother Nature that God has created for humans .
Also , they enjoy their companies .
Older people cannot do extreme activities like young people do ; they have a little enjoyable conversation with their friends .

As I decribed the differences in ways that young people enjoy life and older people enjoy life through specific examples , I believe anybody can enjoy life regardless of age .
The `` age '' is just a number .
It is very rude and disrepectful to think `` Oh ...
because they are old , they ca n't have fun . ''
Older people have already enjoyed their lives like young people 30 years ago .
In conclusion , I strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Are n't you going to enjoy your life when you are older ?
