I agree that successful people try new things more important .
I think someone Who have desire about success are not satisfied one thing .
they seek another things , that is more attractive things .

Successful people have an endless energy about doing something .
So , they do not like a safety position .
They think that staying in a comfortable situation is dead , which makes them study many things .
For example , scientists discover many things .
Even though they earned much money from one project , they do not enyoy the money .
They get courage about doing something and proceed forward .
They find new things every day .
I think someone who have power about things are received from God .
They are borned with the nature .
I like Edison because he has not been edcated , but he did not stop studying something .
As a result , he became the father of science .
He invented many important , realistic , and useful things .
In spite of his successing , he invented another things continuously .

In my opinion , sucessful people like better a risk , adveventurous things , .
That is , thers is no satisfy .
So they work for new things .
