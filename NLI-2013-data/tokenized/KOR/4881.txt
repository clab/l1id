It is often said that selling products honestly is the most important commercial norm .
However , I would like to maintain that effective advertisements help the products approach to customers because I believe that packaging products is more important than the product itself and advanced promotion of the products must be crucial before their launching in markets .

First , outer appearance which can be described as packaging or design is really important for customers .
Some of them may think highly of it rather than inner elements .
For instance , we can witness modern economic conception of marketing .
It gives different values to product except the actual productive quality .
When we see the advertisement of Apple 's iPod or Starbucks , we do not only consider its flavor or taste , but their design , logo , symbols etc .
For modern customers , design must be one of the important criterions .
Therefore , great advertisements are really important to custo

Second , a new product can not be welcomed in markets without appropriate advertisements .
Customers can not purchase the product unless they know it is now available .
It is a fundamental function of advertisements of a new product .
On the other hand , I remember a falling motor company 's advertisements dramatically changed the company 's fortune .
That is Korean KIA motor company .
Although it was about to face a bankruptcy , the company 's advertisement of a new model stimulated customers ' buying desire .
We can simply see how effective advertisements provide the company with the opporunity of survival in competitive markets of motor companies .

In summary , I would like to emphasize how advertisements are one of the fundamental steps as well as of the important choices of commerce .
I am also confident that appropriate advertisements would result in unchanging loyalty from customers .
