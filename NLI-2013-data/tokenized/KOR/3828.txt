I agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not care much about their communities .
The change of how people think is the major reason for this problem .
First of all , many youngsters nowadays spend much of their time doing their own things , therefore they do not have time to think about their surroundings .
For example , many young people want money , so they spend a lot of time on doing jobs .
So , they leave home early , and they come back home late .

Moreover , young people today are becoming extremely lazy .
They would rather do something which they can be satisfied in the short-term , rather than the long-term .
There are many homes today with television and computers , so young people stay in their homes reffering to watch television than help their communities .
These new technologies keep the young people in their homes .

Finally , the new generation of people are selfish .
They would not volunteer to do anything if they do not recieve something .
Even at schools , a child would not help teachers move books unless they get a candy .
A young teenager would not do chores if he does not get an allowance .

Overall , young men and women today must be satisfied with themselves before thinking of others .
It will take a fortune to be satisfied with oneself , so eventually , young people will end up doing nothing to help their communities .
