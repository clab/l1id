Successful people tries new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
These people are successful because of the experiences and the time they have devoted .
This essay will explain why successful people took risks and tried new things .

I agree that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I believe that experience is a key to success .
By having various experiences such as difficulties .
You can learn lots of things that you have never learned before .
In addition , experiences make you mature and shape you up .

By having lots of experiences , you can find another interest that you have never thought of .
For example , one of my friend love to sing but does not know how to dance .
She never dared to dance infront of people .
She believed that her was not qualified to dance and thought her body was not flexible .
Even though she suffered from her tactic schedule , because she wanted confidence she finally learned how to dance , Moreover , her experience of dancing allowed her to use her dancing skill whenever she goes to a party .

In conclusion , I believe that experience and confidence is very important to be successful .
Without these character success cannot be achieved .
