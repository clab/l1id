These days , since the transpotation is developed and many people are financially stable , they have lots of opportunities to travel in other countries .
Of course , there are several ways to trip , however , I personally agree the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , due to the following reasons .

First of all , people can get lots of benefits to follow the experienced guide .
Because they are in the strange country , they do not know the information about famous places , convenient hotels , restarants and so on .
In addition , the guide can prevent them not to get lost , and any inccidental dangers .
If a traveler confronts a trouble , the person can use the wary , from the guide .
In other words , emplying tour guide is useful for travel .

Moreover , people can plan or choose the perfact travel curriculum .
For example , if a person has not enough time to travel , he or she can get best iternity through the advice from a tour company , and spend time usefully .
In addition , the peroson can spend less money to trip , because the travel company usually require not costly price .

Lastly , group activity is interesting , especially in the newly places .
People usually meet new people in traveling .
Therefore , they have chances to be more sociable and make wider human relationships .
They can also learn and share their opinion about new things each other .
It is also preciouse experience for individuals .

In conclusion , traveling with a tour guide offers convenient service , cheaper expense for trip , and more joyable time with other people .
Nowadays , most people think that personal behavior and private is more important than any other things , but in traveling , from my point of view , it is different .
