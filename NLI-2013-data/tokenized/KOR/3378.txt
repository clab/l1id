Nowadays , people are having busy time for doing their stuffs and they merely go for looking in front of them .
Even though some people are volunteering for the social communities .
However , I think lots of people does n't care about the people who live with us .
So , I agree with the statement that young generation does not have much time to help their communities .
Those are following reasons why I am consider like that .

First of all , the technological environment has been developed and it causes people to think themselves than society .
Abundant of technologies are invented in modern days such as television , computer , and telephone , etc .
It developed the culture in the country where we live in now , and people can have more fun with bunches of machines .
Therefore , we do n't have to think that having fun with comunicating with other groups .
So , it makes young people to do not care about helping problems in society .

Also , young generations are more excited about constructing their own life .
They are more satisfied with achiving their goal for making their life successful .
For example , some young adults are really interested about getting job for future .
However , they are not care about helping the old people or disabled people .
It happened frequently in the public transportation .
The young people just ignore the old people who could n't find the space for sitting down .
The young generations are only think where they will arrive .
Finally , it causes the isolation of old generation .
They been found the place to take a rest , but it is not easy .

To sum up , for advancing the field of technology presessed young adults and it makes people who just persuing the goals without considerating other people .
In conclusion , I proclaim that young people should start to concern about other people who lives in dark side in this world .
