As always , people have been enjoying their life in their own way and value .
I think this is true kept constantly for a long time and for good from now .

Additionally , I belive that life is always joyful thing wherever it is over time .

First , If anything this is a delighteing era unlike the period our parents got through the diffucult time in the past .
There are many activities and the resources that old people can enjoy around us in this comteporary era .
For example , we , recently can meet some movies focused on the old persons and it is most remarkable change of our culture considering the fact that the movies usually belong to younger people .

And we can also know that there are many active communities built byr the old and for the old .
These facilities , absolutely help them to enjoy thier life .

Secondly , I am compelled to emphasize the improvement and the development of medical area .
This big improvement acheiving over time makes it possible that human can live longer enjoying their lives when they become older .

Personally , My father is 95 year old and my mother is also over ninety .
Even though they are quite old .
they go out to play golf and swim regular basis .
To tell the truth , I do n't need to even show my parents ' case .
Probably , other people can also find old people who still enjoy active sports around them .
I believe that all of these is possible due to the regular check up in the hospital and assistant of cutting edged medical science .

Thirdly , Is it really true that young people enjoy life more ?
Of course , I admit they are usually healthier and have a lot of energy which is admontly advantegeous for enjoying life .
But we also should know and realize that they are short on experience and some people are callow youth , which lead them to some mishaps and fall in to bad and serious temptation that are located in our society .

For example , everyday we meet the news that young people ruin their life due to being footloose and the behaviors with abandon .

So , younger age is not only good age for enjoying life but also careful age for avoiding the unpredictable results of enjoying their life .

Conclusively , I do n't agree the idea that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
