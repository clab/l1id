When I see the commercials on television , I see many goods which look so facinating and useful .
However , are they really useful like the commercial 's explanation ?
I do not think so , since I believe that the advertisement is a way to lure the cumstomers to buy and to maximize the profit .
Thus , sellers will only show the beneficial and useful sides of the commodities .
Thus , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem more useful than they really are .

First , the nature of advertisement is not to show people how bad the products are , but to convince them that these products are so beneficial to people 's lives that they should buy .
As a result , people who make the commercial have to make products seem much better than the reality .
For example , my friend once bought a physical training machine which was advertised for its quick results .
They said that it will decrease people 's weight by ten pounds in a week if they work out an hour with it .
However , when my friends tried it out , it did not show such results even when she exercised with it for many hours .

Another reason for most advertisements to show only good parts of the product is that if the advertisement shows the reality of the products , customers are not going to buy it , and producers will not be able to make a profit .
To be specific , Tyrenol , which is a famous medicine for cold and fever , is also infamous for its side effects .
I once heard that it can increase the possibility of getting cancers .
If the advertisement for Tyrenol say ` this medicine can cause cancers , ' who will risk the chance of getting more serious disease to cure cold ?

I believe that humans are easily convinced by what is good , but more easily drawn away by what is bad for them .
Therefore , if producers make a advertisement which shows every facet of the products , including the bad ones , people are not going to buy the products since they mostly see the demerit they will have on them rather than the good effects .
Producers know well about such a nature of humans ; thus , they will make advertisements which make their products look better than the reality so they could sell more .
