I agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When I was in korea , I took a trip with my family .
We traveled Japan .
We were in a group led by a tour guid .
They helped us a lot .

First of all , We could n't speaking Japanese , and we did n't know direction of their location .
Also , we worried if there is dangerous thing goes around city .
However , we got a tour guide with our group member .
She took us a lot of place that we did n't know before .
Also she took us a lot of popular place in Japan and restaurant .
We had a good time with our tour guide .
They help people to enjoy their trip , also they are so helpful if we get in trouble with foreign language .

Secondly , if we travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can meet a lot of people as a group member .
As we travel in a group , we were in the group with other family members .
They also loved travel in a Japan .
We shared beauty of Japan with us .
A tour guide led us popular place and we took a lot of great picture from there .
It made me one of beautiful memory .

Finally , a tour guide teach us to view world widly .
They tell us and teach us different culture and different costume .
They were not like teacher , but it seems more comfortable when I learn about different contry and their culture in the class .
It makes me more enjoyable and more interesting .
Also it helped me to view world widly .
I 'm getting more interest in other different country .
I wish I could visit all of the place in the world .
A tour guide makes people to learn different culture comfortably .
It 's really enjoyable when we travel in a group led by a tour guide .

As travel in a group led by a tour guide , more safety and more enjoyable than when we travel by ourselves .
We can learn different culture easily than by alone .
It helps people to getting more interesting in different culture and country ,
