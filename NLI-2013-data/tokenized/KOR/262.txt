I am strongerly agree with the statement .
I faced the same problems everyday during studying .
Students can be more rely on the ideas and the concepts of what we are learing .
I will develop three important reason why this statement is true .

First , It is more easier to learn ideas and concepts .
When we try to learn the facts , it 's more harder to understand and it might confused them more and more .
Also It can bored out the students when we focus on the facts .
It might be interesting , and it might help us more .

But what is the point if we do n't understand .
There is no point to learn about what we need to learn .
Second , I think that udeas and concepts seems to stay longer than the fact .
When we understand the ideas and concepts , it stay in our memory longer , because it interests people more than the fact .
I have been taking anatomy class .
It was really hard for me to learn something that uncommonly used , but if I applied my concepts or ideas to the definition or the body part , it 's certainly helping me to understand what I am doing and also easy for me to memorize .
Third , It is important to understand what ideas , because that helps me to think more what I am learning and to make me think more and more .

Thus , learing facts does n't hurt .
But to understand ideas and concepts can help students more effective .
Also this lead them to be more interested what we are learning .
