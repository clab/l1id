I strongly aggree with the statement that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
I think yong people have less resposiblities than older people .
Older people have to earn money and take care of their family .
For this reason , old people abandon their time and life for their family .
Otherwise , yong people does not have such a responsibility .
They spend most of time for their own life .
In my case , I spend my time on playing games and sports , doing habbies or watching movies .
However , my parents can not enjoy what they want to do .
They work every day to support us .
Therefore , I think that enjoing life depend on the haviness of responsibility .

For other reason , yong people are more energetic than old people .
Even if someone really enjoy playing harsh sports but is not energetic enough , he can not do those sports .
In my experiment , even when my family goes vacation to mountains , valleys or beaches , my parents can not play longer .
They exhaust faster than I do .
Thus , I agree with that statment .

Furthermore , yong people are more opened at many entertainment system than old people .
As time passing , many entertainment system that did not exist in past has developed .
So yong people have more chance and more choice to enjoy their life .

In these reason , I gree with the statemnet that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
