I disagree with the statement .
I think there will be a increasing needs to own cars around the world majorly due to ( i ) worldwide population growth and ( ii ) industrialization of under or less developed countries .

Even though the rate of increase seems to modify , the global population is still in increase , thereby creating basic grounds for the need of new car .
As you may easily imagine , the more people live in the earth , the more personal vehicles they will need , and certainly no other personal vehicles ever invented will outbeat the cars in the foreseeable future .

The industrialization of under or less developed countries , such as those in Africa or Asia , will also create new need for the cars .
Looking back the history of 20th century , it is reasonable to think that there will be many under or less developed countries will grow to be more industrialized in 20 years .
The industrialization will stimulate the construction of the infrastructure , such as the road and increase the level of income of each people .
When two things combined , the massive need for the new cars will be created .
Taking for example , Korea , my home country , there were not many cars in 1980's .
However , together with the rapid industrialization , a number of cars used in Korea has increased dramatically .

One may argue that as the people grows older , they tend not to drive a car and as the average life of people around the world gets longer and longer , it will cuts the number of cars used in the future .
I agree , in part , to such argument , but in my view , when people gets older , they normally do not buy new cars when their cars get outdated , rather than immediately dispose of the cars that they owned .
Therefore , such an impact , even though it may be real , will not be huge .

Putting such factors into consideration , I trust that the cars which will be in use after 20 years will outnumber the be
