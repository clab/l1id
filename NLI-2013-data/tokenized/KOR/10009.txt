I think that the main idea of this statement is successful people try a new adventure also get some risks , and they already know how to do well .
I think this idea is important , because if people try to success , they should try a new thing such as a new job or a new opportunity what they never try it .
That could be very hard at first time , but when the time goes , we could find out our success through the new opportunity .

Commonly , people wants to do work which is very easy or very common thing , they do n't want to look like speicial and they afraid about the risk after they do that work .
However , this is the difference than common people , and successful people in our life .
Almost all of succesful people create something new .
I think that only a few people achieve success from old idea .

Successful people think different way from other people about what kind of new things will make them successful .
Also , they make an effort with their work .
Here is the example of Thomas Edison 's success story .

Thomas Edison was not really smart boy when he was young .
However , he had really creative think with everything and try to do experiment if it is possible or not .
As he said , 99 % was his failure , only 1 % was his success .
He did not afraid with the risks , keep concentrate a new experiment .
I think that his creative thinking and make an effort was the success point for him .

Every people wants to success in their life , they wants to earn money a lot , and get a authority in their own life .
But , if they want to success in their life , they should think different way from other people , find something speical which is not really common thing and should be aware of some risks that they will have , but if they success with a new adventure , they can be a hero , successful person in this world .
