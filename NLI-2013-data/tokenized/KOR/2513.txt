I belive that all the people want to enjoy their lives .
Not only old people but also young people , too .
I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are more energetic .
Young people can make more time than old people to enjoy .
Young people do n't have to think about the other people in the family like old people .

First , Young people are more energetic than old people .
They work hard and the next day they can enjoy snowboarding whole day .
Then they have no problem to go to work the next day .
The do n't get tired easily , because they put priority to enjoyment of their lives .
However , old people do n't want to get too tired since they care about their hearlth more than young people and their bodies do n't follow their mind .

Second , Young people are more flexible at their time .
Old people have to think about thier jobs and consider the other people 's schedules , too .
On the other hand , young people can make time whenever they want to .
They can come home late to go to the movies and go to the libraries until late at night not considering the time .

Finally , There are more possiblities that young people are singles .
When they are singles or do n't have the babies .
They do n't have to think about what other family members ' opinion about their enjoyment of their lives .
They can go to the night clubs .
They can go to trip whenever they want to .
But when they are not singles , or have children they should consider many situations , and ca n't be selfish .

From above the reasons , I think young people enjoy life more than old people .
They do n't have to think about many situations which old people have to do .
Health , flexible time and what other family members .
