It is debatable that what is the better choice between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialize in one specific subject .
Some people say learning about many academic subjects is more useful for their life because the more we learn , the more we can use during our lives .
However , I disagree that opinion because there is no enough time to study on specific subject perfectly and studying many things has no use in society .

Our lives are too short to study one specific subjects .
If we learn about all of things , we can get only a few knowledges from them .
For example , when I was young , I has interests in piano , art , and Taekwondo .
I learned those of things in same time , but now I have no much skill in all of them .
Today , I have a regret because if I had chose one thing among them , I could have one professional skill to show my ability to the people .
So , we have to concentrate on one specific subjects for more efficiency .

In conclusion ,
