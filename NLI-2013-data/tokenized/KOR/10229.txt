Is there anyone who is successful through a entire history without challenging to a new things ?
I absolutely agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know for some reasons .
At first , trying new things means getting new chances .
Secondly , if they fail , they can learn something that other people never know by their experience .

The first reason why I believe successful people try new things and take risks is about chances and possibility of being successful .
If people just do what they know how to do , that means they will have no chance to learn new things and achieve new goals .
Speaking of business , nowadays if someone wants to start his/her own business , she/he will contemplate about the field that other people does n't try yet or is not varified enogh about the success .
Trying new things somewhat means seizing an opportunity .
It 's clear to take high risks in a new fields but once that business get a right way , it also can get much more success .
The higher risks are , the bigger success will be .
If there is a someone who just follows the familliay way , it would be safer and esier but success , the result , would be limited in return .

The other reason why I think being successful requires to try new things and take risks is learning new things .
In a challenge , there is a lot of possibility to fail .
However , people can learn lessons or new knowledge from that failure .
This experience is never exchangable with anything .
It also can be a sturdy foundation of their next step .
Most successful people got through the severe failures but they never kneeled down to that bitter experience .
If people could get over it and learn something , they would be successful with it .
