the answer is .
I agree about it .

The world is developing now and follows it people developing with that , which means the facts that we have to learn is getting now useful .

I live in korea , and in korea , the students need to learn every subject that we do , so we have usually almost 12 subjest to learn , the reason why I mention is korea academical learning is old , the subject we learning is the fact that has been finished by long time ago , we know it , but sometimes we are learning something that it 's not useful .

The world has developed and we have to follow that the technologe is really high now , which answers that facts are not useful to know , we can use it facts , but we do not really need to konw it , because we can find the knowlege from the internet which means we do not need learn about the facts that we do n't know , which means we do n't need to know all the fact that we had to know before , on the other hand , some facts are need to be known as common sense .

the world is developing and person is developing , people is developing , so the society does n't want the people that good for everything , which means the major knowledge is more important , which means we need to be good for one major thing .

We can understand something better with facts , which means understanding ideas are better than known facts , like now developing country , we have a lot of competition with the others , and we have to have major skill to make a job , so we ca n't really think about the learning facters , because as I mention that internet does that job , so now we problem is how much we understant about it , not how much we know .
that also means we understand the society .
