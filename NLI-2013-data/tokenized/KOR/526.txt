Some people insist that broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be background knowledge for the future , others say that deep specialized knowledge will better because real world do not need broad knowledge .
In case of me , I strongly believe that broad knowlege of many academic subjects will be better for the following reasons ; one is good for the real world , the other is good for the relationship between others and me .

First of all , I worked in POSCO `` Pohong Iron and Steel Company '' for a 13 years .
According to my experience , I did not use well specicalized knowledge which learn in university because I have to learn real world knowledge of my company .
On the contrary , I often use other common knowldege , for example , communication , statistics , and Six sigma , which educated by our company 's institute .

When I was in university , I applied and studied other foreign language , Japanese , because I think that Japan is most short distance country from Korea and will be help for the real world .
My expectation is correct because my company 's facility was imported from Japan so I can easily understand the system of my works and go faster than my co-worker .

Secondly , To get maintain good relationship with other people , you will need common knowldege because you will lose your chance if you did not learn at school .
You will easily see the person who have good specific knowledge , we called professional , do not assimilate with hierarchy structure like military and company socity .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that broad knowledge of many academic subjets is better than specialized in specific subject because I can prepare for the real world by using broad knowledge and maintain good relationship with others .
For the above reason , I strongly believe that broad knowledge is better .
