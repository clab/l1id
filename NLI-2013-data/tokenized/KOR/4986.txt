I agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Today , mass media has a great power on human being .
Boys want to wear Nike shoes because Michael Jordan wears it on TV and girls want to buy some specific type of dress , for example , Levi 's low rise jeans because Jenifer Lopez or Brittany Spears wear it on TV .

If those products , such as Nike shoes or Levi 's low rise jeans , were not on TV or magazine , I do not think they would sell like that much even though they had still same quality .

We watch TV almost everyday and the commecial says that we can be as good at basketball as Machael Jordan if we wear Nike .
TV tells us that we can be as pretty as Brittany Spears or Jennifer Lopez only if we wear Levi 's low rise jeans .

There is Korean saying that `` if the food looks good , it makes taste great . ''
It does not necessarily mean that the looks of food make any difference on taste .
But people are easily influenced by what we see , and it effects on what we think about the food .

I read an article about a cleaning machine when I was in Korea .
One small company invented the cleaning machine .
It was a small machine with wheels and it could go around the floor and clean up by itself .
After it came out , other big company started to make same kind of cleaning machine .
They advertised it on TV and in newspapers .
Which one would you buy , the small company 's cheap but nice one , or the big company 's more expensive , but ween on TV one ?
After the advertisement , the small company could not continue that business because people only bought the big company 's cleaning machine .
This is a true story .

Advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are because we are very easily influenced by what we see .
