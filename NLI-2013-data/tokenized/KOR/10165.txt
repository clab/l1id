We can see many successful people is word such as BILL GHATES and EINSTINE .
BILL GHATES made a lot of money form creating a software called windows and EINSTINE made a great theory such as E = mc2 .
Even the way they succes is different the common thing is that they gave there entire life to built it .
In my opinion successful people doesn ; t try new thing but try to develope the thing they can do well .

BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old .
At that time there was two famous company called MACANTOSHI & APPLE ( well later they united though ) .
He tried to learn computer because if was very interesting .
later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself .
This kind of result was able because he constantly developed his talent .
In my opinion for succesing finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important .

EINSTINE is also a succesful persone is physics .
His new theory about black energy , black holes , times , lights and movement destroied newton and platon 's theory and made a new page is the history of physics .
It is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man .
In my opinion that the reasone it was able is because he always thaught about physics .
Many books and researches says that he thaught about physics 60 percent of his time .
As you can see successful people developes there talents rather than finding a new way .

To conclude I think that successful people find there talent and develope what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do .
It is because no pains no gains .
not trying any thing and seeking for chances to succeed can never make a good result .
