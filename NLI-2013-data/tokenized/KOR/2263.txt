Young poeple easily accept new technologies use them .
New technologies helps people to experience convient and fun things .
Experiencing convient and fun things leads to people enjoying their life .
For example , when people travel by car , young people may use navigator in the car which hleps them to travel far easily .
They can find simly the location they want to see .
However , old people tend to accept new technologies easily such as navigators .
Figuring out how to operate navigate systme in the cars is hard for old peoples .
Thus , they do simpler trip while young people travel to diverse places .

Young poeple usually have more passion than old people whatever they do .
I think people need passion to enjoy their life .
They have to try to find out how they can have fun where they can hang out for fun .
They have to plan to some activities .
To do all these preparation for doing something to enjoy , great passion is required , However , old people usually do not have passion whatever they do because they are socially and mentally weak .

In conclusion , old people have some barriers to enjoy their life completely such as phsycial problems , dull senese for new skills and weak passion .
