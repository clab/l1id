First of all , let me ask you about this quetion .
Would you like more cars or not ?
Are n't you aware about the severe air pollution problem ?
Do n't you get embarrassed when passing in a speed of 10km/h in crowded area ?

In twenty years , less cars will be in use than now .

Actually , i used to dream these kind of cases when I 've been involded in environmental friendly social services .
Our goals were to advertise the air pollution of cars and encouraging people to use public transport .
By that time , I sometimes had that feeling one day , cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly .

Likewise , the place i 'm living now Singapore is the very country which succeed in reducing the number of cars .
The high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers ' taste of getting a new car .
Not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as ERP , those which are paid when cars are passing the city area , are having great success in making people using less cars .

This morning , i read on the internet newspaper about one very special item ; the Flying Car M-400 .
This car has been put on Ebay as an ` on sold ' item and the price predicted was about 4000 millions US $ .
It also included that this kind of cars will perhaps be more popular in about 20 years , and be the time 20 years pass , I think scientists and engineers will be able to find a new kind of sources as replacement of fuel .
Well , it 's truth that people have already started to use gas using cars or even cars with engines using oxygens .

No one knows what will happen in 20 years .
But considering the current ways people think about pollution and the fact that science is still developing , i prefer voting my part to the one agreeing at the statement .
Franckly said , at the time i was born , personal mobile phones were predicted to come out in about 30 years which we actually made it within 15 years .
