Some people these days , might want to travel in a quite place or by one 's self .
For instance , there are some people around us who do n't like to be in a group and meet people .
I support the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
It would make people 's travel more interesting .
For example , lot of information are givin by the guide , saving time and more opportunites to travel much more places .

These days , traveling does n't just mean playing .
People also treat traveling as one of the education that students should definitely need .
We could hear lot of imformation from the guide .
There are lot of guides who are really intellegint these days .
As we can get information while we 're traveling , it will allow me to be more thoughtful stdent and knowlegeable person .

Most importanly , people who are traveling can save lot of time than who are traveling by one 's self .
The reason wht is that almost all of guides planned exact schedules which lead travelers to have much more thighten time .
For me , I would'nt wate time by traveling .

Another reason is that we could have much more opportunities to to travel lot of places .
Most of travelers might think they want to travel and visit lot of places as possible as they could .
For example , travelers would not want to travel fewer places than the other travelers who paid same amount of money .

Thus , these are the reasons why I would prefer to travel in a group led by tour guide rather than just travel by myself .
Led by a tour guide , travelers could have more information about the places , saving time by guide 's plan and we could afford more opportunities to travel more places as possible .
So I belive it will be more interesting for people to travel .
