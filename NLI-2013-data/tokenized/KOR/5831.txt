People have different opinions on whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
People who oppose this statement argue that in the future we will also have so many cars due to our convenience .
They think that using cars are the most convenient way to go another places .
However , I disagree with this statement for two reasons .
First of all , in the future , we will have other methods to go another place .
Another reason is that in twenty years , we will go abroad more often .
Let me explain the reasons in detail .

To begin with , in twenty years we will have more developed machines instead of cars .
When my grand-grandfather was a child , he can not imagine cars which is privailing nowadays .
He watched cars only in movies .
This was because in the past , wagon or horse were the only transportations .
However , nowadays we have a lots of transportations such as bus , subways and airplane .
It means that our technology has rapidly development .
Therefore , in the future , we will have more technological transportation .

Next , in the future we can go abroad more frenquently .
It means that we feel no need to use cars .
We will usually take airplanes instead of cars .
This is because using cars can not go foreign countries .
When I was young , I just traveled in my country .
However , now things were totally different .
Recently , many schools plan their vacation for student go abroad .
In addition , if they travel another country , they have to take airplanes , not cars .
This means that in the future , we will use airplanes for going abroad more often than use cars .

In conclusion , I support the idea which is that in next generation there will be fewer cars in use that there are today for the reasons that I mentioned above .
First , we are supposed to have other transportation instead of cars .
Second , in the future , we will go abroad more often .
Therefore we use airplane frenquently .
It brings about decreasing of using cars .
