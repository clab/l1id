Not only Korean tourists but also other Asian tourists are notorious for very noisy group tours .
In fact , many friends of mine have their summer trips in a group led by a tour guide .
However , I think the real value of tour can be achieved by individual tour planning .

First of all , a tour with personal planning gives a lot of lessons .
I think a single trip is similar to a path of one 's life .
When I was a college students , I used to make a plan by myself .
Of course , it was very tough for beginning .
However , as time went by , I got more used to get useful information and well-designed planning .
During surveys of tours , I met many advisers from various fields .
It also helped me to enhance my interpersonal skills .
I still keep in touch with some of those people .
As the old saying goes , people live and learn .

Secondly , individual trip can be more flexible .
Sometimes I see people who suffered from their tour with a tour guide .
That is because they had to follow the group 's schedule rather than their own preference .
On the contrary , in my own trip , I could explore more various sites freely whenever I feel I need to spend more time in a specific place .
When I had a two weeks backpack tour in Europe , I stayed Rome for a week .
Considering the overall trip period , it was significantly long period .
If I had to follow a group tour 's rule , it would n't be possible .

In conclusion , I do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I think it has more shortcomings than gains .
For me , I prefer a individual tour with own planning to a boring group tour with typical routines .
