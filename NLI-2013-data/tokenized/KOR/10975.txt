I strongly agree with the statement that great people take risks and accept new challenges in order to achieve great things .
Since great achievements mostly do not come by in accidents or at no cost , in order to make achievments , people need to assume the necessary risks and challenges involved .
Many supporting examples can be found in successful business men and scientists .

The most widely known and cited example of a successful business man is probably Bill Gates .
He is the father of the most widely utilized softward affecting millions of population around the globe .
However , many doubt whether this could have been possible had Bill Gates decided to continue his study .
Rather , many ascribe his success to his daring initiative to drop out of college and start his own career as a programmer in the early stage of his life .
By trying new things and assuming risks , Bill Gates did to achieve great things that many people aspire .

The most genious and creative inventors the world has ever observed so far , Leonardo Davinci , has also assumed certain risks and challenges that were necessary to his great achievments .
According to historians , Davinci was widely criticized and mocked by people when he first attempted to fly the air .
Being a completely new idea back then , most people considered this ingenious invention unrealistic .
Despite the circumstances , Davinci continued on with his project and is nowadays regarded as the greatest inventor of all times .

In summary , history and current events attest to the claim that successful people try new things and take risks in order to make great achievements .
Bill Gates had to assume considerable amount of risk when he decided to quit college and start his own career early .
Leonardo Davinci had also confronted new challenges when he decided to attempt at flying .
