Since the invention of the automobile , the amount of cars has increased .
Now we can hardly find a family wihtout a car and even can see ones with more than two cars .
As the population grows , at least it is not decreasing , the amount of car will increase too .
So there wo n't be fewer cars than today are .

Car is very important in our life .
It is the most individual vehicle that we can ride .
There are public transportations but we can only use the limited usage of vehicle of the public transportation .
That is , whenever it caome to an accidental situaltion public transportation wo n't be very helpful to individuals because individual cannot use them for their own purpose .
So the car is necessary in our lives .

However there are a lot of problems caused by a huge amount of the cars .
Two Major problems of them are air pollution and limited fuel .
Fuel used in cars are basically refined petroleum .
So when it burns in the engine ti emit CO2 and make NO and NO2 which are the main pollutant of air pollution .
Also petroleum is limited resource that would gone in next few decades .

Car has its importance in our lives so it wo n't decrease in amount but instead there wiil be new forms of car .
For example , a Hybrid car use hydrogen which burns and emit water and an Electric car which use battery and motor to run will replace the current form of cars gradually .
