Eventhough , learning facts is important to pass exam or know knowledges , understanding basic ideas and concepts are very more important for learnig something .

Many subjects have their own basic ideas and concept .
For exsample , Learning the histories , there are a lot af fact in the past .
many students studies events for their studies , however , only few students think about why the events are occured .
Learning and findind out the reason of events is very helpful to know history deeply .
Not only history and but also math requires to know concept of process .
Maybe it is not inpossible to pass exam with only facts .
Students should know the concepta od process to prove the answer .

Understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students for make their own decision or studies .
If students learn only facts , It is hard for them to know what the facts ' purpose .
They cannot find out what they learned exsectly .
In my country , middle school and high school students usually learn facts without ideas and concepts because passing exam is vety important for their life .
However , when they imigrantto the other counties espacially The Unites state , they feel hard to study because they do not know the real purpose .
Also , learning ideas and concept help making desicion because set up the ideas and condept help lead to process and reach a goal and facts .

In Art classes , many teachers teach students to explain their are work because final works are not important and it cannot be good art work without thinking , ideas and concept .

In summary , I think learning ideas and concept are more important to learning fact .
Most of facts of subject composed of their own ideas and concepts so knowing these are basic to know facts .
