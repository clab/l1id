I disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I think that using well One specipic subject is useful .
We develop one subject .
Studies make many Knowledge .
So one subject is we become deep studing .
Various thinking become knowledge .

But , If we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will make nomal student .
We have only information .
One special subject is that student make thinking .
Also , it is important .
