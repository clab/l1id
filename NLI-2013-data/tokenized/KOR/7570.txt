Someone say the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
And Someone recommand the best travel agency that own experience .
Of course , the oppinion correct some area .

If you ask to me the reason , I can explain the resean .

First , when you go travel , if you join in a group led by a tour guide , you must allow the fixed time and fixed rule .
It 's not real travle , I think .

If you always think about keep the time , you do n't enjoy to enoght the travel .

I stayed their for 5days .
The most memorised things , just guid 's always said to me `` Keep on time '' .
I can find good memory through some fictures .
I do n't fine good memory in my brain .
It 's too sad story .

Second , If you lost your thiking at keep the time , you do n't have any freetime .
Sometimes we travel to have freetime for own life .
The freetime help us to fine good feel .
It is so terrable thing that we do n't have any freetime while travel .
Maybe it give plenty stress to me .
For example , when I visited in China , I wanted to have some time for fine history place .
But , the guide leader did n't agree with my apinion .
So , I did n't have satisfy travel .

Some times , it 's a knowledge or sotimes it 's a good mood .
If you follow the tour guide , you do n't any try to get a information or a knowleage .
It 's a important thing that processing prefare the tour .
Someone can get many thing , if have time for ready attitude .

So , I
