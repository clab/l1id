After 20th century , car became one of the most familiar thing to people .
Now it is hard to find households which have no cars .
However , it affects environment seriously and also brings more and more traffic congestion .
Certainly it needs some change and it will change to a positive way but we cannot say there will be fewer cars in twenty years .

Car is an essential one in our life and I would say even the society will not be properly going without cars .
In this situation , we cannot imagine the life without cars .
Not only personal cars but also buses and taxis should be included .
Governments try to reduce the number of cars in their countries but it is not an easy process .
FIrstly , they need get agreents from their people and who would give up their cars ?
Without a brilliant solution , it will not work .

However , there will be different kind of change , change on sorts of cars .
Many famous car companies are traying to make more environment-friendly cars for the future .
Hybrid car or electricity car can be good examples .
Also , there are some people who make a car only using solar energy .
Once car companies start to make those cars , there will be even more people who want to drive a car because it that case , no need to spend lots of money for fuel .

Car has got important status in our life already so nothing can replace its role like a mobile .
It is into our life deeply and even more and more children get their own mobile .
I think there will be a same situation in car market .
More and more young people will buy cars and it will be pretty easy to get a car in cheap price .

To conclude , since those reasons that I mentioned above , road will still be full of cars after twenty years .
It must be a different kind of cars , however .
Environment-friendly , driver-fiendly cars will appear in ten years and also we might welcome flying cars like in a movie .
Flying cars will be too further from but the important thing is cars will not disappear ever .
