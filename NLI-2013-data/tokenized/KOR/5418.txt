I agree with this statement .
As improvement or development of technology , every house has their own televisions and radio .
and also internet used as a good way of advertising some products .
But since the purpose of advertising is selling the products what the company made , when they advertise one product , they overly exaggerate that product .

when I was in elementary school , I was walking on the road .
I saw one person advertising a fan .
What I heard was they are selling fans only that day with 50 percent discount .
and he kept saying that it never breaks and he used that fan for last few years .
But when I bought that fan it broke in a week .

And one another day I ways watching television .
and when I watched one commercial which was advertising diet food .
and they were saying that , `` If you eat this diet food for a month you will be like one of the hollywood stars. '' and after few weeks I saw one article in the internet which was talking about that diet food does n't work well .

People do n't buy products which does n't look or seems good .
Every day people want better and better products .
So the company automatically try to show their product is better than other company 's product .
In the advertisement they always talking about the good thing of their product they never says that the bad thing of their products .
So people might think that the product is really good so they should buy it .

advertisement is a important bussiness .
It 's a only way to company introduce it 's goods to everybody .
But since there are so many companies are in this world .
They stated competing each other and try to exaggerate their product than the other company 's product .
so I think the products seems much better than they really are is because of that 's the way to survive in this world .
