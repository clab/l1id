In my country , there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fishes instead give fishes .
It says important of learing not only the fact but also the `` the way '' .
But it highlight that the important of the way .
Like this old say , I agree that student to understand ideas and concets is more important than to learn facts .

First , If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions .
For example , when I was middle school student , at first time of math class , I could n't understand what teacher said .
But finally understood the way of solution , I could solve another math questions .
Although that question was more difficult , I understood the way of solution so I could do it .
If I could n't understnad , I could n't solve that question .

Sesond , If student understand idea and concepts , they can imagine more idea nad concepts .
I mean , for instance , when I was high school student , I learnd about poet .
Most of people do n't like poet because of words .
That words were difficult to understood except teacher .
Teacher could understood all of words .
That is why that is important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , I could n't understand because I did'nt have any idea .

So I agree about that statement .
