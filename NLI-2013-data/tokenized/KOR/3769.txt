Some people think that the youth nowadays are not intersted in heIping their communitis .
However , I stongly disagree with that opinion , for the following reasons .
First , a lot of young people including collegeate students and secondary school students are forced to help others by their school .
Most of the publich schools have a regulation about the obligatory volunteer hours and they encouge students to experience to help people who are in need .

In my case , to graduate both secondary school and university I had to do the obligatory volunteer .
This is not a good case because there 's no my will but it can be helpful to experience and can give some motivation to students .

To meet the needs of the school curriculum , I had to do volunteer work for local community when I was a secondary school students .
Even though it was obligatory experience , I could take part in community program and I came to be interested in local problems and other people who are in need .

Moreover , these days a increaing number of young people would like to participate in volunteer works .
They paricipate in their communities problems by joining some organization such as extra-curricular clubs in campus or non-governmental organization .

Through the organization , I have been able to be a mentor to a young criminal who has been under the probation by ministry of justice .
When I wanted to join that program , I was surprise by seeing a lot of university students who applied for this organization to be a volunteer work .

Nowadays , a lot of organizations set up and they are managed by lots of volunteer workers .
We need to keep watching their behavior .
Even though , they could start the volunteer work to meet the schools needs , it can be lasted because of their strong will .
