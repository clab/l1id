People have different opinions on whether young people do not give enough time to helping their friends .
People who oppose this statement argue that helping friends is most important role in friendship .
However , I supported this idea for two reasons .
Let me explain reasons in details .

First of all , nowadays youngsters have lots of things to do for their own .
For this reason they usually do not pay attention to their friends ' problems and just concentrate their own works .
Let me take my experience as an example .
When I was in high school student , I had an car accident near my school .
That day , our school had an important midterm examination .
Although it was not seriou accident , I had to be care of by someone .
However , for preparing test anyone helped me .
My friends had to hit the book before the exam .
So they just called teacher for me and went back to their class .
I disppointed from them .
Therefore , nowadays teenagers usually deal with their own work .

Next , recently people can find easily to solve the problems not from their communities but also from other special institues .
In the past , if teenagers had a hard time to study , they asked their best friends and solved together .
For example , if students who are not good at math , they can share the information how to study math .
This is because they were same situation .
However , todays we have a lot of academic institutes and private tutoring agency .
Therefore , young students have abundant sources which can help them to solve their problems effectively .
They can ask them how to study , what they have to take , and how to solve the problems .
This shows that youngs do n't have time to share theirtimt wiht friends .

In conclusion , I agree with the idea which is that recently young people do not have enough time to concerning their friends .
As I mentioned above , they are suppose to focus on their own jobs .
In addition , they can solve their problems by contacting other sources around them .
