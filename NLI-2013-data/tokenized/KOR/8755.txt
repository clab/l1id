I agree with the opinion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learnig facts for them .
I will explain the three reasons .

First , I think understanding concepts is basic .
You ca n't build a high building without rock as a basis even though you may build a short block like a house on the sands .
If you learn the facts without accurate concept , you may hear you are smart at first .
But eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of thr fact will collase .

Second , I think you should experience the proper process .
Everything has an order in process .
Understanding concepts is a start .
So you ca n't understand further facts without them .
If you skip something , you will meet the trouble in the end .
Speaking again , If you ignore the process of understanding accuratly , you will find you did n't know even a easy thing .

Third , you should undersand the academic thing as a whole .
All the thories and facts link together .
You should understand something through another thing .
If you learn facts separately , it seems like you see the tree but ca n't see the forest .

So I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
A pile of There is no meaning without basic understanding .
