People have diffrent opinions on the best way to travel is whether in a group or alone .
People who support traveling group states that group tour is safe way .
However , I think that the best way to travel is alone .
Let me explain in detail .

To begin with , traveling alone is good because it makes me can go by own choice and feel a sense of achievement .
People who prefer group tour probably think it is comfortable .
Of course it is true .
However , travel with alone can enhance independence and achievement because travel must need decision by oneself .
For example , when I was at age 18 , I visited Japan with my firend .
After arrived Japan airport we were afraid and scared .
However , we could go disney land , sinjuku , hayaoh museum and so on followed our decisions .
Of course we were tired because lost the way of hotel or subway and we were not good at Japanish .
After the trip , my friend and I can feel exciting and assum travel with a sense of achievement .

Next , alone tour allows me to making various experiences rather than group tour .
Many people enjoy travel around the world .
Travel let me meet many people from diffrent countries and cultures .
Few days ago , I read a book about backpack trip .
The book is written by girl student from Korea at age 20 .
The girl traveled the Europe .
She decides to go to the trip around the world wanting make many friends .
During the travel , she could meet French guy , Spanish girl , Togo man and so on .
Also , travel made her experience fruitful .
For instance , when she was difficulty finding hotel , a German old couple suggested enjoy their home .
Then she could feel how ordinary people live in German .
After the trip , of course , she made many friends from all over the world with To conclude , I insist that traveling alone is good effect on our feeling and experiences for the reasons that I mentioned above .
First of all , I can feel a sense of achievement .
