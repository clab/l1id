There is proverb ; Knowledge is power .
It means more knowledge brings more power .
I strongly agree with that having broaden knowledge of many academic subjects is better .
There are some reasons why having broaden knowledge of academic subjects are better because of application at other fields and various experience .

First of all , by having different kinds of academic subjects , we can apply other different fields .
For example , if construction company has plan to build new modern style building in city .
In this case , first thing we can think about is company must need an architecturer , who builds building .
If architecture has broaden knowledge of other academic subjects , then it would be better for making building .
He can use various subjects such as art , math and geology in order to build a building .

In addition , modern society needs people who are able to do multitaking job .
Moreover , having various academic subjects can make people have various experience .
For instance , I am majoring business at school .

I takes not only economy , which is my major subject , but also English , computer class , pyscology , and socialogy .
In the future , I want to be a successful businessman , and succeful businessman needs various fields knowledge and experience .
A busineesman needs interpersonal skill , resposibility , of course economic knowledge , and language .
