I agree that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years than there are today .
Although , cars are the main transportation currently , there are transporations we could use other than cars .
In addition , more inventions would be brought , and also because cars are one of the main factors that pollute our environment .

Every year , our society improves and evolve seeking for better way of living .
Two of the issues that are disliked from using cars are comfort and expense .
As we all know , cars are expensive to buy , especially good and well-known brand cars .
Great amount of money is also spent to maintain these cars for such reasons as oil fees and parking fee .
Moreover , as more people afford cars , there are lesser place to park cars and the parking fees would increase as a result of their demand , which make our life thougher .
Therefore , by the time of twenty years , more people would use other public transportations such as subway .

Secondly , people like innovations .
They prefer new technology , goods , and ideas , which leads to having new inviention of transportation other than cars .
Therefore , in the future , they might come up with new style of transportation which is similar to the cars we use nowadays , but that would no longer called cars anymore .

Lastly , the issue I consider here is health .
As more and more people afford cars , the more our environment would be polluted , which is n't what many people prefer .
This is obviously because pollution harms people by damaging their health .
Fortunately , people are getting sensitive about their health .
This phenomenon will possibly reduce the use of cars in twenty years .

Overall , as a human being , I prefer having comfortable life with spending less on cars , adore innovations , and having good health .
Therefore , in my perspective , I think fewer cars would be used in twenty years compare to the use today .
