I agree that the most advertisemnets are actaully making products seem to be much better than they really are .
One of the reasons which it makes are when the marketing systems are covered up with larger and better advertisements , then people will buy them more and more that makes the higher protests and so as their companies and also stores .
The other reason is in our lives almost commercials are making people to think of something or buying depends , so each commercials are trying to catch your eyes and catch your attention , and that is why many companies in thesedays are saying only good things and showing out too much lies because of making more money .

I really do n't understand how this society has become like this , liyng just for money and always people talks about bills how it goes all those kind of stuff .
What if people figures out that , they wo n't buy products anymore because thier quility is n't good and it 's diffrent than what commercial saying .
However then comanies will make better advertisements to catch their attention again and when people do n't buy those products anymore then they will be doing samething again , over and over .

As i said .
Yes i do agree for this statement and therefore to me companies should make fair and true advertisements so the society can stop wasting money on bad products by covered up advertisements .
