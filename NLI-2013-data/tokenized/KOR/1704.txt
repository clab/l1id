Some people think that studying a wide variety of subjects is a waste of time , and that one should concentrate on one 's major .
Of course studying hard about one 's majors is important .
But learning other subjects , which might seem at times unrelated to one 's major , is just as important , especially in institutions of higher education like universities .

I will introduce my own experience to illustrate my point .
I am an art major , studying to become a professional artist .
I could have just been content with the technical training and painting classes that the art college provided .
They did help a lot to improve my creative skills .

But I `` wandered off '' to the realm of art history .
At first it was because I wanted to learn about how the great artists of the past created their works .
But as I studied on , not only did I learn about the history of visual culture , but how artworks could be seen from a historian 's point of view , and inside the cultural , historical , and social context .

I also took a lot of elective courses in literature .
These classes showed me how beauty and self-expression could be achieved through words .
I was provided with a chance to compare how literature was different from the art form created with color and form .
It made me think deeper about what painting was really about : what its characteristics were , and just what it was that could be done only through painting and through no other form of art .

Although art history and literature had nothing to do with the actual painting process , they both helped me try to produce a better , deeper painting .
Art history opened my eyes to the fact that artworks could be received from a various points of view .
Literature classes made me think seriously about the essence of painting , my major .

In conclusion , widening one 's scope in academic interests not only results in becoming more informed but also in opening one 's eyes to a wider perspective .
Moreover , one can understand one 's major better by studying other subjects , rather than restricting oneself in one 's specified field .
