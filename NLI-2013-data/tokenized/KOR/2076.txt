This quetinos reminds me of my father who passed away two years ago because he said before about this topic .
This question gives me what worth life is for me .
I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .

First of all , you people have more opportunities to get someting .
For exaple , young adulthood can try someting new such as new field of studying in colleges or universities for their purpose .
They can study abroad for a better life .
Also , young people can join a lot of activitives with many people even if some activities are dangerous they can do .
In other words , they can be satisfied with their life .
However , most old people cannot stand for a long time to do something such as studying new fields or joining clubs with new people .

In addition , I think young people 's health is better than older people 's , so young generation can try more than older people for their happy time .
For example , young adulthood can go a long distance for a long time for traveling or challenging , they can easily endure some risks and hardships .
Therefore , they can enjoy more to spend time for travelling in the world .
In contrast , old people usually have diseases and show weak to do someting .
Also , they always need someone who help them to live without thinking about lesire time because it is difficult to do someting as a patient .

Finally , young people can meet many people such close friends relaltved jobs or colleges .
Because most of young people have many friends who still live near surrounding them .
They can share their emotions and ideas for a their enjoyable life .
Meeting people makes them more energetic and dynamic .
On the other hand , old people cannot share their time with close friends like young adulthood becaus most of friends passed away or live far away from them .
They often feel longly and stay alone without having a enjoy time .

I know a few old people have opportunities and a time like young people for enjoyable life , but it is not many .
It is true .
My father said to me , before he passed away , it was difficult to enjoy travelling and doing someting , I know why he memtiond like this .
Therefore , I belive that young people enjoy life more than the old .
