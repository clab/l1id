Basically I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

What do you think the meaning of ` enjoy ' ?
Young people can enjoy more kinds of sports than old people do because their physical condition allows more chance to do like snow board , motorcycle , mountain climbing , sky diving which are need more wild actions and physical abilities .
No one can say old people can enjoy these sports too .

The sports is one of the most important way of enjoying our life .

Furthernore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life .
For example , they have to consider their family and company before challenging new things .
However young people feel more free to launching new things .
They are much bravier than old people so that they can experience more about new world eventhough they fail sometimes .
That is o.k for young people because they have plenty of time to recover their fail or mistakes .

Therefore , Young people can enjoy life more than old people .
I did n't mean old people cannot enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people .
