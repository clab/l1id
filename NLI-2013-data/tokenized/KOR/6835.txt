Many people today use cars for transporting , going shopping and etc .
As the society is developed , people use car more and more .
So I do not agree that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .

First , many people who have not car will buy a car when they earn a lot of money .
As world economy is increasing , many people will have money which could be used to buy a car .

Secondly , in the future people will like traveling more than these days .
Then , people need a car .

In conclusion , I believe that there are many cars in the future .
