The issue here is which one will be better to have for academic knowledge , broad subjects or specialized in one specific subject .
It is very complicated issue to choose one opinoin and to explain reasons to decide .

I would have to say that both are important equally , and I may not say that wheather I agree or disagree the issue above .
I might have to say that it perfectly depends upon the situation for undergraduate or graduate students .
I would like to explain my own opnion that it is hard to choose one issue .

For college students , it is better to have wide range of knowledge in many academic fields .
After graduation of high school , young college students are still are not legally grown up .
However mentally , they are going to face and study for real knowledge for their life .
I believe that most high school graduates have strong long-term goal for their own life , but they have never met advanced subjects before entering college .
They should see various fields to choose the specific field for their own life .
It really important chance for them .

For deeper studies in graduate schools , students have to be specialist for their own field .
They need to know further knowledge and to have deeper unerstanding on the field that they already have chosen during being college students before .
As graduate students , they rather to study and focus on specific subject to have compatitiveness to go to the real world .
Of cource some will not go out of boundary of university , but this kind of students also fosuc on specific subject to be a professer something like that .

In conclusion , I agree that students must do both broad and specific academic knowledge .
However I have to say that it is fully depends on their situation .
One more thing that I would have to say is that students must have their unique and strong compatitiveness , selling point .
To have this unique and strong compatitiveness , students have to think deeply to select what they really like and want to be .
What ever we do , time goes on .
Time is limited to everyone .
Students , please do n't waste time .
The world is yours .
Be ambitious and be global leader .
