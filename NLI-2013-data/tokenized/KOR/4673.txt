Many people think that products which are showen throgh advertising are real .
But my opinion is that most advertisemens focus on making products look like better than they really are .
Because their function is to make products look nice to sell .
and In the modern society which has a lot of products , they have to get opportunity to sell throgh appearence of product .

The advertisements is capacity to sell effeciently .
That 's why they try to show the products seem much better than themselves .
Without using the product , nobody knows ability of product .
Before the customers choose some products , they are hesitated .
To them who are confused the choice , advertisements have to make them purchase thire own products .
How ?
Through charming feactur .
They have to suggest to the customer before they choose some products through that products seem nice .

Additionally , nowdays all technology have been improving .
So the copy of some product is so easy .
If some company invent the product which attract to the coustomers , as soon as other company also make similar product .
In so many choice of same product , coustomers try to compare with other companies .
In same technology , it might be same ability of product .
Then , how to sell more than other companise ?
The answer is the advertisement .
But other companies also try to make nice advertisement .
Then how to show that our products is better than other product ?
The answer is to make products seem much better than they really are .
Nowdays business is unlimited competion world .
But there is limited technology .
That 's why most advertisements make effort that products look better than themselves and others .

conclusionly , I am sure that most advertisements try to make products look better than they really are .
That 's why the advertisements exist and in thesedays without showing well , the products can be choosed by coustomers .
