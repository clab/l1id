I strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of two reasons .
First , older people had already enjoyed their lives when they were young .
Second , older people can still enjoy their lives .

Before my grandfather died , couples of years ago .
He used to tell me about his life when he was young .
He used to tell me all his stories about ; his girlfriends , his adventures and his passion .
But , he cleared me something , he told me that he still enjoyed his life .
This is a clear example of how much older people enjoyed their lives and they are still enjoying it .
The time of enjoyment is like two or three times longer than what we , young people , have enjoyed .
Therefore , it all sumarizes that older people enjoy life more that young people do .

As mentioned before , older people are still enjoying their lives , some young people would say that , older people can not use the Internet or go to an amusement parks like them .
But , that is completely wrong .
I have a friend , whose grandmother plays computer games with him .
I could not believe it until I saw her playing with us .
My friends grandmother likes going to amusement parks too .
Last summer , we went to Wonderland together , it was simply amazing !
Here , we can see another example of older people enjoying their lives .
In my opinion , if older people are healthy enough and strong enough , they can do whatever they would like to do .

To sumarize everything up , I disagree with the statement and I think older people enjoy life more than younger people because older people already enjoyed their lives before and they keep on enjoying it .
