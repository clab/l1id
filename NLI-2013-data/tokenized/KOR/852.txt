People have different opinions on whether It is better to specialize in one apecific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I agree this opinion for two reasons .
First , elites in only one apecific subject can sucess more easier that peaple who know everything little .
Second , to specialize in all apecific subject is very difficult .
I will explain in detail .
To begins with , peaple who know onething deeply can sucess more easier that peaple who know everything little .
the genious in one subject have their road th go .
In example , I want to talk about my friend .
In high school , Her total grade is lower than me , but she is always the first in math .
In the end , She entered the better university than me because of math .

Next , to have deep knowledges of many academic subjects is very difficult work .
so , many people failed all thing because they invest thier talents to too many subjects .
Let me see my experience as a example .
When I was a middle school student , I wanted to do well in various subjects .
So I went to learn many things in academy like piano , Taegwondo , witch is the korean fighting skill , math and english .
However , studing after exercising is more tired that ordinary , .
so , I failed the exam in math and english .

To mentioned I above , I disagree that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one apecific subject
