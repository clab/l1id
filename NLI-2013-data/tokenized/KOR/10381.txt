I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because of several reasons .
First of all , successful people are possible to learn and realize various things in their life and then they get the lot of information and knowledge through their trying to new things .

For example , the person to try to new things and take risks can prospect and see the different field with his or her experience .
On the contrary , the person not to try to new things and take risks can not prospect and see different field and also he or she may be embarassed or surprised these circumstances because of no experience .

In fact , only few people having the experience about new things and risk can be possible to know the skill , like as `` how to do this dangerous position '' , `` how to manage some risk '' as `` the statistic of the management ability in the dangerous environment . ''

Actually , lots of successful people know this fact and they try to new things in their various places or conditions .
Second , people should be learned and experienced time to time because enviroment has chaged and rapidly developed as technology .
For instance , the person working for the computer science company specially is required the new skill and ability as the improvement of technology .
Finally , I agree this .
