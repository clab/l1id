In the morden , some parents or teachers ignored student 's ideaI .
However , I do n't understand why are they disturb the student 's idea .
I agreed that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Firstly , they have to see the world more wider and higher than before .
Later he or she have a very various ideas and concepts like Tomas Edison .
If some parents expect to some child 's opinon , they will learn very specific ideas , they can contribute in society or polictics in the world .

Seconly , if parent or teacher have to expect , the student can expect their parent or they can help their parnets .
for example , there is a very strange A boy .
He always want to make something , so their parnents expect him to make a lot of ideas .
After 10 years , he became a very good inventor , .
and graduated a very good university , also , he have to reply to his parent to make comfortable invention .

Lastly , we can make a lot of story when we are taking care of children and they would n't believe anything .
Most of children want to know curious something such as Batman , Superman and Santa Clause .
If they did n't know the fact thet are shock their belief , and they would not believe anything later .
We need to expect them continoulsy .

The society is more complex , and thought of student is more complex , too .
Today is changing is very busy , and students want to rest something .
Some stuednts are retireing continously .
If parents or teacher expect them first , students also try to expect them , too .
student 's idea and concepts is very important in this society , also student make to use their thought what ar they want we know that .
