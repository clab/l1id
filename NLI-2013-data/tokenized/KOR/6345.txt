Currently , because of the rising oil demand in the would-be next-gen superpower China and India , there is a rise in the demand of car as well .
However , also at the same time , because of some futurists ( scholars who `` prophesy '' how will our lives be in the future ) claiming that crude oil will run out in forty years time and the fact that our so-called ozone-hole is getting larger almost by the size of Korean peninula every year , it seems to me that in twenty years cars would be abandoned much more than now .

First , there are environmental problems .
I have seen a documentary addressing this issue .
Rather shockingly , because of rising sea level ( due to ice melting ) caused by global warming ( caused mostly by burning oil ) , someone in America made an article claiming our planet could encounter yet another ice age in less than twenty years time .
The fear of encounting constant blizzards that has terrorized earth 's species over time should be quite enough to make people give up cars .

Second , unless we have a more environmental friendly and renewable energy source , cars would have to be abandoned .
Think about this .
If only oil and LPGs can run our car now , they would become scarce in twenty years time , which also means that petroleum ( including both oil and gas ) price would skyrocket .
it is already skyrocketing and it will be more severe in the future .
And we make plastic .
Plastic come from crude oil , which means that plastic is another reason why we deplete oil .
So cutting down on plastic is another problem to using oil , and people wo n't really give up this convenient substance .

Finally , and if we are to be optimistic about it , is that we will overcome the environmental and energy problems and have flying machines right up there with skyscrapers that are no longer called skyscrapers because they are common .
Although this cannot happen , proven by the development speed of contemporary society ( and probably late Stanley Cubrick 's ` 2001 Space Odyssey ' ) , who knows ?
It might just happen !

So my opinion is that there will be much less cars than now .
But if we can overcome problems like cars with hydrogen engines exploding all the time and find out methods like how to generate energy from solar battery even if it is cloudy , then there could be many cars like now .
But because these problems are hard to overcome , I 'll go with the downfall of cars .
