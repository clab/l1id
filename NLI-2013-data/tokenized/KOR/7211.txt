Whether to travel by forming a group or individually has been controversial among many people .
However , I basically disagree with the position that it is a best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
I have two reasons for my claim .
It prevents people to enjoy their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited places .

Most of all , people are hardly like to enjoy their privacy once they had a trip by joining a group .
As a matter of fact , participating a package travelling needs oeople to organize altogether and always neccessary to have a cooperation with the strangers .
Besides , people are even required to eat their meals at same places and a same time .
Thus , there is no private time available to enjoying themselves such as walking on the beaches and having some relax when they wish to .
As a result , traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite dissappointed .

In addition , it is hard to travel around some places where they want to .
Generally , the trip 's schedule has already planned by a tour guide which makes it difficult for people to visit their own desirable places where they always dreamt about .
In contrast , by travelling around some countries alone , will allow people walking around places and take some photographs and enjoy thier holidays .
Accordingly , going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to acess diverse places .

To sum up , everyone has different opinions on this issue .
However , I strongly oppose the perspective that travelling as a group is better .
This is because it provides lack of time to have private time and only few places are able to visit .
