I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are a few reasons why .
One reason I disagree with the statement is that young people are required to help their community for certain hours .
For me , as a middle school student , have to help my community for more than ten hours a year which is a lot for a middle school student .
Also , to get accepted into college , you need certain hours of community service .

Another reason is that the young generation has a culture of donation .
Donation could be a big help in the community and many young people are donating money to the community .
For example , a college student who worked at a part-time job , donated more than half of his hard earned money .
Also , at schools , donations are made by students .
My class collected money and donated it to an orphanage nearby , which is helping the community .

The last reason is that the meaning of giving enough time to helping the community has changed .
In the old day , there were lots of poor people who needed support from the government and the society .
So people back then had to work very hard to help the poors and improve the community .
But now , things have changed .
There are not that many poor people in the community and things to improve .
Also , back in the old days , skills and technology did n't matter much because there were n't that many high-tech things to improve in the community .
But now , it is different .
Non-skilled people cannot help in the community because everything has become high-tech , so only people with skills can help the community directly .
Nowadays , we help our community by donations and during community service hours .

These are the reasons why I disagree that young people nowadays are no giving enough time to helping their communities .
