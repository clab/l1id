In the four-word short maxim , `` no pain no gain , '' contains the tremedous truth which reveals the secret of the successful people in the history .
The people who brought progress to the world were those who challenged themselves to new things through the painful situation , and not those who followed the typical rule accepted by the world .
Columbus took the risk of going to the sea in order to discover a new continent , and the Wright brothers , took the risky action of inventing air plane , the best inventory human ever created in the history .
Trying new things despite high risks and pains are one of the common factors of the successful people .

Columbus not only took risk of his own life but the risk of hundereds men when he went on the unprecedented trip to the ocean with his followers .
People did n't think it possible to discovered the new land , and even those who suspected the existence of continent were n't bold enough to try the risky business .
Only by trying the new and dangerous business , Columbus was able to succeed in acheiving his goal .
On the other hand , others who did n't try new things were never able to succeed but only made his success even more special .

The wright brothers , who brought a huge progress to human life for inventing air-plane , also took a great risk when they experimented their air-plane .
Even after their air plane fell and the incident almost took their lives , the brothers did n't hesitate a moment to try again to successfully invent their air plane .

Most people follow the typical rules accepted by the world ; few people go over the typical rules and make a great acheivement .
Like Columbus and Write brothers , only those who go over the boundary of socially accepted and the risk , are the people who change the world , so called successful people .
