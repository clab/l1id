As far as concerned , I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .
Maybe it could happen in far future but in twenty years there will be more cars that are more developed .
There are several reasons of my thought .

First of all , cars are comfortable and fast tranformation .
It enables you to get any place that has ground .
When I was a high-school student I often late in class because there were lots of homework to do and the class started early in the morning .
So my mother gave me ride to school so that I would not late in class .

Next , cars are useful to move havey things better than a person .
My parents did not have a car just after our family moved to US from South Korea .
We had to go shoopping to buy some food and furniture and other things .
We had so many things to buy but we did n't have any transpormation to get to the mall and bring those all stuffs .
There was no other transpormation except individual car to get to the store .
So we had to borrow a car from the next door that we never met .
It was really a embarass experience .

In my oppinion , there will be cars just as it is today .
