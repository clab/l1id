The most of people around this world confusing that , young people more enjoy their time than that of older people .
This is the most common flaw in this time .
In 21 century , we have such a competitive and aggressive world to live .
If you are not awake all the time , then you will be beaten by financial situation , co-worker , even freinds whom you rely on .
That means especially young people , they take part in a main competition for their survival , it 's hard to tell young people enjoy life more than older people .

In nowaday , a lot of young people work for more than one job .
Of cours , they have many reasons to do so .
Main reason will be to prepare for their better life when they got old .
And after that , it can be said ; to accomplish the own personnal goal , to pay credit card bill , and so on .
Then when these people got old , they do n't need to struggle that much for their better life .
Because , as you know , the most important factor to enjoy our life is money now .
Without money , nobody can enjoy life , if we still sure that homeless , beggar , hooker on the street ca n't enjoy the life that we called life in the topic sentence .

Cleary , older people who can enjoy life more .
Those people are surely , who were being better prepared from when they were young .
On the other hand , young people who enjoy life are just taking a break .
After break , young people start to keep themselves in the long-run race for the better life .
So they can enjoy more life when they got old .
Besides , young people have more things to do for that of they responsible for themselves .
However , since older people who already done with those things when they were young , they can enjoy life more than when they were young .

Therefore , i disagree with the statement ; Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
