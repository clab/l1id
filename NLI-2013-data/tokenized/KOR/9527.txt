Although some people said that successful people are creative and more challegeble than others , I disagree with this view point .
I believe that successful people do thing what they already know how to do well .

First , most successful people do one thing that they can do well .
For example , well-known pianists practice so many times that they can carry out well .
Eventually , they become more skillful and it makes them famous and successful in their field .

Second , when people concentrate one field which they have already known , they can keep thinking about a specific subject or think about new idea , which is challgeble to common belief .
For instance , psychology professor , Alex Sandra , challge to common belief which drug lead to addiction itself .
He kept focusing on his research in psychology field .

Finally , doing one thing can makes people to save their time ; therefore , it makes a high possibilty to become well-known person in their field .
On the other hand , a person who changes their field often to do new things might waste their time .
They do not have enough time to study or concentrate their subeject well .

In short , doing one thing which they already know how to do well makes people sucessful than a person who trys to do new things .
