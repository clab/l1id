It is often said that only doing what we already know how to do well is safe and stable way without risks .
However , if I were asked to tell my opinion , I would recommend to try new things and take some risks because it will provide us with new opportunities , betterment of performance , and increase of lives ' quality .

To begin with , trying new things gives us new opportunities such as a new achievement which was never explored before .
For example , if Bill Gates had not dropped out his school and worked as a normal salary man , what do you think would have happened ?
I ca n't imagine the presence of Windows , which bring us high benefits in our daily lives , without his challenge and braveness toward his vision .
His success on business is based on his try .

Secondly , a company can survive and flourish with new ideas .
Samsung is well known for semiconductor business .
When other competitors are satisfied with 4M flash memory chip , Samsung made a big decision to develop 16M flash memory .
Even though there was a big risk , the revenue and value of Samsung drastically increased after they launched new flash memory .
Then , it has been able to lead the semiconductor industry by trying new things and developing new products .

Finally , trying new things is able to give us new perspectives and progress .
In my case , I was quite satisfied with my job several years ago .
My salary was not low , I had been appreciated quite well .
However , I started feeling that my knowledge and experiences were getting limited , and it seemed I was not progressing any more .
So I determined to shift my job .
As I tried to find new and better job , I realized that I acquired new perspectives to the business field and increased the value of myself .
Now I am eagerly excited about my future life even though there might be risks .

All things considered , trying new things will enable us to meet new opportunities , maximize the performances , and live with better quality of life .
