In these day , advertisements is the one of important marketings in business because it can be the first impression like on a screen of television , for 30 seconds chance can change customers ' needs .
I agree that some of advertisements make the product look like the best qulity than real .

Primarilly , visual effect is the biggest impact one in society .
Televisoin is common media and most valuable marketing for business .
When you watch one commercial on television like vaccumer , they show us that stuff works well and look luxury .
However when you buy it , mostly time we realize that it does n't work longer as much as we paid and after use several time , it looks cheap .
Even we knew that the advertisement will not be the true but we believed our eyes through the screen .
This kind of cases , the moment of commercial , it should look the best product that ever made .

Secondary , i am interesting in business so if i sell my products , i will make my idea seems like much better than it was existed .
I want to make them to use my products like good value not srteet one .
If they do n't seem fantastic , they will never try to buy and use .
I think that people have bias before they know better .
Good looking is good impression .
This is the marketing of advertisement .

However , we should be careful about that because when we loose clients , deceived them , you never be succeed .
Advertisement is giving a chance to ues to customs and show them their quality and value not just selling them and making money .
Honesty is the best policy .

In conclusion , I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are the creative job and important method for market but we should remember that whenener looks good should be good qualities .
