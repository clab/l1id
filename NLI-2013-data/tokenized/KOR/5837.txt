Most of people love cars and want cars .
Buying a new fency car is a dream to billions of people who do not have a car .
The quantity of the car will increase continuosly in several decades .
Because of cheap car , developing country and desire of people increase the number of cars .

First , our car technology is advanced rapidly past several years , and it makes car cheaper .
It is hard to imagine to own the car in 70's for non-rich family .
My father told that there are fewer than one hundred cars in oursity when he was young .
So he did not think about having the car , but he has one now .
Because of the cheap car , cars will increase in twenty years than there are today .

Second , there are hundreds of developing country and undeveloped country .
These countries will develop like other countries someday , The similarity of the developing country is growing of the car population .
In 1950's Korea was one of the poor countries in the world because of the Korean war .
But , after America 's assistance Korea became modern country in 30years .
In 1950's only few foriegner owned the car .
But after 30years every single family had car .

Last , the desire of people will increase the car population .
Most of men wants to buy a car if they had a lot of money .
In fact , most of rich people has more than two cars .
And people like them are increasing too .
When I saw the TV , there are a rich person who has 70 cars in his home .
It was hard to belive , but the show says that there are millions of people who have cars more than ten and it will increase .

In conclusion , it is obvious that too many cars can cause air pollutions , traffic jams and more car accidents .
But these reasons actually can not stop the growing car population .
