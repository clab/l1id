I agree that students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is that this statement is for students .
Do you think about it that if students does n't like study for themselves .
It makes big problems .

First , If students does n't understand or misunderstand , it makes to go wrong way to students .
Students want to know knew impormations , but they do n't understand well about knw impormations .
So , they need teacher who makes to understand them .
If it does n't important for students , students do n't have attention .
so they become that they does n't like attention about new ideas .

Secondly , They want to interesting study .
If students does n't understand ideas , it is that their class is not interesting to them .
I experience about that , too .
When I was highschool student , I do n't like English because my English teacher alway hit me with my grade .
I want to study English but my teacher did n't .
He always do quizes and tests and he hit me with their grades .
I think it is problem that it is exept to understand .

Finally , in school , students wnat to play without study .
Because their subjects are without understanding .
For example , Korea has many academies for that they help students can go unversity .
Academies teach interesting more than schools .
And they teach fast more than schools .
So , schools are bouring to students .
Students always sleep in school and after school , they study hard in academy .
It is wrong education system , In conclution , understanding is important more than learn facts for students .
It will decide their futures and contries destinies .
We offer for their futures .
It is that our future become to go good way .
