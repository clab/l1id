In these days , there are numerous problems which are related with cars , such as air pollution problems , traffic jams , or fuel problems .

Second , new technologies develop to substitute cars , such as monorails , private air crafts , and these equipments will be practical immediately .
There have been many researches to create new transportation which is better than car , and finally these days , these efforts are gaining their results .
For example , many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in common places , because the air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars in these days .
About two years from now , they succeeded in the development , and according to some newspapers , it will be practical in ten years from then .

In brief , cars are the main transportation equipment in these days , but it will be decreased as the government policies change and new technologies develop .
Even though we can not think of our lives without cars in theseday , our children or grand children will think it 's o
