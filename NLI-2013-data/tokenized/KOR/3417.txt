Nowdays , there 're so many debatable issues about young people 's life style .
Especially , some people think young people do n't give enough time to helping their communities , so they look down young people .
However , I think young generation spend enough time for their communities and they should n't spend more time to helping communities .
Because there 's an major volunteering class ( in school ) , young people has numerous things to do without helping communities and yong people 's time is for dreaming .

First of all , there 're a lot of programs to make young people help communities , and almost young people do it .
For example , almost schools forced students to spend the time to helping communities in Korea .
The required volunteerng time is high , and connected with the grade .
In those way , young people do help their communities .
I think it hard work to young people , and they do well until now .

Second , we should understand that young generation has numerous things to do and they want .
When I think the young generation from junior-highschool students to 30's , it 's easy to guess that they are really busy .
School , company , friends , famillies ...
Their heads are already full of thing to concern .
In my case , I 'm 21 years old , there 're lots of things to do im my school and house .
It involves homework , studying , housechore ...
Actually , I ca n't breath easy .
There 's no time to think about something unimportant .
Like me , other young people has not enough time to draw the dream and future .
However , according to survey by KBS , a famous broadcasting sistem of Korea , young generation spend more than 20hours in a week to help their communities .
I think that 's enough .

Shortly , I think we all
