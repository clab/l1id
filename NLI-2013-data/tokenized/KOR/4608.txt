Through the television , nespaper , or on the streets we can see any advertisements .
And we sometimes feel that advertisements are seem too much better thatn they really are .
And that is true .
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are .
But there is reason for that they need to make advertisements seem much better that real products .
For make looks better , cheaper , bigger , or useful .
I will give you some situations for prove my opinion .

For the first situation , when you see advertisements , you could see that they are saying that you will never get this products in this price .
But when you are going to the mart , you will feel that their products are not that cheaper than other companies products , or sometimes you will see more chaep one .

For another situation , when you are driving , you can see the advertisements on the street sometimes .
For the example , their is advertisement that advertising a restaurant on the street .
Usually lots restaurant advertising with their foods pictures .
So they are make you to go their restaurant , and get their foods .
However , when you go that restaurant , sometimes you feel that their foods are much smaller than advertisement .

For the last situation , on TV , we can see lots advertisements .
We can see same advertisements in same time , same channel everyday .
And whenever the companies built a new product , they are make new advertisements for their new product , so people are going to buy thier new product .
For the example , the cell phone .
we can see the verizon , or cingular 's new cell phone every month or two months .
And they advertising that their new cell phone is best cell phone in this world .
So they made you buy their new cell phone .
But two monts later , they made new cell phone which is much better than your cellphone .
Now , your cell phone is not the best cell phone in this world at all .

When you see my statement with these reasons , you will feel that most advertisements are seem much better than their real products .
But for make people buy their products , they will keep make advertisements that seem much better than they really are .
