Traveling another country always gave us enthusiastism .
When I was young , my mom and dad sometomes fought because of going trip with a group led by people or going by our selves .
Whenever we have a plan to travel , although we have significant ideas , we usally had the trouble .
Both of them give us convenience things , However each of them gives us good things and bad things .
The way to travel with a group led by a tour guide sometimes provide convenience .
The guide is guide us famous and popular places .
Also we do not have to make a plan for trip , and there is no percentage for losing roads .
However I belive that going travel without a group led by a tour guide is more effective .

Going travel without a group led by a tour guide offer a new and different kind of experience to traveler .
We can try to find anywhere we want to visit .
Even if we lose our roads or the ways to go , as finding the right way , that is going to be unforgettable memories and experiences .

It is the travel for our enjoy and rest .
However , if we go with a group , it could be very uncomfortable travel .
We always need to think of them and watch out for them .
there might be a scehdule that we do not want to .
We cannot do whatever we want to either cannot go whatever we want to go .

The last of all , we can save our money for traveling .
There is some package for traveling in a kind of flight company .
That is their job and they need money .
It means it 's cost is higher than traveling by ourselves .
We can waste our money , even our times !

According to those reasons , I prefer traveling without a group led by a tour guide .
Also I hope everytime I travel , I want to have much fun , at the same time I want to save my money .
