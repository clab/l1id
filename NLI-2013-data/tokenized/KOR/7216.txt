I agree with this opinion .
when i was traveled thiland by myself .
there was too many problems happend .
as im a girl .
i was threatend my securities .
it was really stressful .
and i ca n't conversation with thai peoples .
i did n't know how to deal with many problems like housings , eatings ..

so travel in a group led by a tour guide has many beneficial .
First of all , you will protect from a guide and group .
security is very important when you are traveling new places .
Secon reason is that tour guide knows well about travel and which place is recomendable .
so you do n't need to spend your time for considering about which place is more good to travel .

Third reason is that you do n't need to worry about housing and eatings .
generally a tour guide is speak a very good local language and a tour guide leds group of a people .
so fee for room is more cheap .
and most tour companies related to bunch of hotel changes .
if you travel as a group member you do n't need to worry about food. a tour guide helps you what you eat on the travel .
all you need to do is just enjoy your vacation
