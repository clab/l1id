Nowadays , the world is getting closer and closer .
People want to travel around in their holidays .
Though we can travel without tour guide at any place , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First , one of the reason why we travel is to experience new circumstances and environments .
So , we can face some difficulties and dangers while we are travelling .
If there is a tour guide around , we can escape those dangers effectively .

Second , tour guides are specialists who know well about the tourist attractions and famous places of the area .
So , we can see around as many places as we can with the guide of the tour guide .
Usually we do not have enough time to travel the whole region .
Under the time limit , we can travel more effectively with the tour guide .

Third , if we travel in group with many people , we can share information and talk together .
If we are lucky , we can make friends and keep in touch with the person after the travel .
As for me , I love to meet other people and share thoughts with them .

Thus , I would travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling alone .
There are also many good points of travelling without tour guide .
We can make the itinerary on our own and that could be a pleasure for us .
Also , we can get time to think about ourselves while travelling alone and can get deep understanding of ourselves .
But , I would rather choose to travel with a professional tourguide because there are more strength points than travelling without tourguide .
