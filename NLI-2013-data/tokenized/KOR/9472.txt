It is said that the understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .
There are many students who only try to check the facts because they are used to the test asking the choice of solution .
However I think learning without understanding ideas and concepts is not effective and meaningless .

To begin with , many students who do n't understand the profound ideas and concepts of the facts will not be able to solve the problems successfuly when they face the a little bit different problems .
Even though the problems requests students to find the other aspects of the general facts , students always apply the same facts to solve problems , Moreover , they can not realize what the mistakes of their solution is .
My brother graduated from a famous high school in Korea with a good grade .
However , when he studied in the university , he suffered from the lack of the understanding an important ideas and concepts of the facts .
Because the university education needed him to think over the problems considering the concepts and ideas .
He finally gave up getting a degree in the university .

At second , when students focus on the facts , they can not develope the skill that is necessary in the real life .
We have to do many activities such as finding a problems and suggesting the sitable solution in the companies .
At that time , we sometimes need to get the different point of general view for the more innovative solution .
However , the students having no understanding of basic concepts and ideas could get the unique point of view .

In conclusion , I can not agree the learning the only facts is enough to overcome and solve the every situations .
Without understanding ideas and concepts , there is no way to find the real method to solve the complex situations .
So we need to motivate the students get the understanding of the profound concetps and ideas of the facts .
