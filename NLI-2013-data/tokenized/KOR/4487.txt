I strongly agree .
I would like to say these days `` age of PR '' .
When I buy something , there is a very difference between I have seen advertisements or not .
For exemple , when I buy and eat a Mcdonald hamberg , I can trust before I eat .
I would think what it has high quality and taist no matter what it have because I have seen Mcdonald 's advertisements long time and a lot of time , but when I buy and eat a hamberg which I have never seen advertisement before may be I can not trust it before I eat .

Sometimes people know what every advertisement are not really .
Sometimes advertisement has problmes which makes confuse people , but even like that advertisements make products much better .
So I would like to say `` Advertisement makes products seem much better than they really are .
