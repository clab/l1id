Some people might argue that it is more important for students and some might argue that it is more important for students to learn facts .
I most certainly believe that it is more important for students to learn facts rather then just understan ideas and concepts .
The reason is that understaing ideas and concepts only offers brief summery of matter but not specific details .
There are many are that students are required to know details rather than just ideas and concepts such as mechanism and history .

First of all , mechanism requires students to know all the specific details about machines .
For instance , if a student is to learn how a heater works , then the student need to know not only the concepts of devices in the heater but also the facts and details about how it all work together .
Lets say that one student who understand how heaters work wants to create a heater .
Even if he has idea about heaters , in order to actually make one , he needs to know all the facts and details how the machine works Secondly , History requires students to know facts rather than understand ideas .
Lets say there is a student who is learning avout the world war two .
Understanding the concept and idea how the world war two started would be important but know the details and facts about the world one two would be moreimportant .

Thus , as can be seen as above , I certainly believe that learning facts is more important for students than just understanding ideas and concepts in that there are many cases that understaing ideas and concept would not be sufficience .
