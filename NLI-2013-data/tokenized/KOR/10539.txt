I agree with successful people try new things and risks .
I have some reasons why I think when successful people try to new things thoes are not professional , weak experience and knowlege about new thing .
From thoese points , people have to take risks when they try to new things eventhough they are already successed before .

First , he is not a professional about new things .
For example , a man who is a really successful restaurant owner .
Every body wants to open restaurant , like him .
He probably has some successful ideas and actions .
Also , he is sure about his restaurant food and style .
It makes him professional owner .
However , if he wants to get another shop , such as flower .
He likes flower , but it is not enough to open the flower shop .
Even if he is a successful restaurant , it does n't have a grantee of successful flower shop .

Second , person who wants to try to new thing does n't have enough experience .
As I wrote about the man who is the successful restaurant owener .
He ca n't open flower shop easily because he doe n't have lots experience about it .
Everything is different .
For example , when you eat some food , you can realize that every food has different taste .
It comes from experience .

Last , person who wants to try to new thing does n't have enouth experience .
The man who I wrote an example is a successful man from his own business .
Maybe , the he has enough knowlege about it , but he is not get easily .
Some of knowldge from book , specific person , and so on .
But , most important knowlege from own experiece .
I mentioned In conclusion , thoese reason which are not professional , weak experience , and knowldege .
In my opinion , wherether successful people or not successful people have take risks when they try to new thing .
Also , we do n't know that successful people can possible to have failed experience .
That 's why I agree with successfil people try new things and take risks tather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
