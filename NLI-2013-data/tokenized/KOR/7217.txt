Traveling in a group with a leading tour guide gives us much convenience .
However , it also restricts our choices and freedom during the tour .
On the other hand , we can customize our trip .
Then , the trip might become harder , but it will be more impressive .
There are three major goodness of a customized trip .

First , we can schedule trip according to our need .
Traveling with a tour guide makes us to see many things , but usually does not fulfill our need .
However , the customized trip enables us to enjoy particular things enough that we want to and never restricts what we want to do .
Moreover , we can reorganize the schedule every time we need , hence we can enjoy the trip more and more .

Second , we can save money .
Traveling with a guide is usually more expensive than without him and we even need additional money to pay the guide .
Thus , we can save the money by planning our own plan and traveling without the guide .

Third , we can feel the real society of local .
When we traveling in a group led by a tour guide , we usually move by bus and just see some important things and places , hence we are completely disconnected to the local society .
Furthermore , we may not even say a word with a native .
However , if we trip without a guide , we must contact with the local society to buy some essential and to ask for locations , and we can feel that we are really on a trip .

Traveling without a tour guide might not be an even road and you might starve , thirsty , and feel dangerous .
However , once you do it , you will tend to travel independently again , and finally it will give more precious memories , responsibilities , and courage to you .
