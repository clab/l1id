Of course I agree to the statement that we have to be well aware of many academic subjects .

First , the informations nowadays are organized each other too complex .
Likely the systems of education are altered , the forms of informations and the shapes of business are becoming difference from the past .

For exemple , the SOHO shops are emerging prominently in internet , we can see the tremendous of shops in there also a lot of so called CEO exists .
They started their business as a whole company even if it is too small to have one employee , not subordinated to big company .

The CEO must know a lot of knowledge not restricted to the goods , he or she made .
She need to know how to make the money .
Then she need the skill to manage the schedule , make the strategy to sell the products , and how to pack and so on .
He or she can get that information in the internet nowdays easily , even if it is very professional like experts but this could be the good exemple .

Second reason is , the world is turning so fast and young person does not persist to stick to one company , or the same job .
This tendancy is not the subject that we can tell the right or worth .
It is enduced by the difference thought of the new generation .
So As we perceive the markets we involved is corrupt , young people would have no atitation to leave and might want to move another job or might search the utterly diffrenent filed where they 've been .

In conclusion , It is good to expose us to all the circumstances that we can confront , maybe it could be the issue of aquainting and assembling the knowledge not the knowledge itself if we probe it discreetly .

Anyway the reason why I prefer to choose the prior statement is because we must be ready to the uncertain next society .
