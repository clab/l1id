Time is the most effective heal for hurt ; it is not an exaggeration to say that flowing time brings one experience , maturity , and satisfaction .
By undergoing obstacles during their lifetime , people can enjoy their lives wiser and easier .

Some people say that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do , considering that young people enjoy to challenge on new things , such as bunge jumping or accessing to millions of web sites .
However , other people argue that older people enjoy their lives more thoughtfully and wisely , based upon knowledge obtained from various and numerous early experiences that they had before .

No one can deny that young people have high spirits and love of challenge or innovations .
They seem as if they are enjoying life most thoroughly ; they sing whenever they want to , eat whatever they want to , and chat wherever they want to .
Elderlies do not : they like sitting on rocking chairs , reading newspaper in peaceful minds , and knitting while watching sunset .
They are quieter than younger people , but know how to enjoy simple things around them , which younger people would consider `` boring everyday life '' .
Older people enjoy what youngsters consider unenjoyable .
They entertain themselves in most simple , but peaceful ways , considering their life experiences .

Time can be a heal , but it can work as a shortcut to entertainment .
Older people , who had more time and experience compared to younger people , tend to enjoy their life in their own ways , peacefully and thoughtfully .
