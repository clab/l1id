Nowadays , young people are the busiest people among their communities .
They are called as people who are promising and hopeful in the future .
They are the one who can bring nnovations and have the ability to change the world more favorably .
Hence , we can not blame those young people being busy to work harder to keep up the steam .
They do n't even have much time to helping their communities .
For those young people , 24hours a day might be even a little short .

Is it really ruthless to not give enough time to helping their communities ?
Working harder and making effort continuously might be more beneficial later .
They might bring a better world to live such as more comfortably and more favorably .
This will cause the effect of happiness among many people .
For instance , the world might turn into a very peaceful world with no wars nor struggles anymore so that there would be no more tragedy of separating families .

Nevertheless , on the one hand , young people should give enough time to helping thier communities first .
Every single work has to be done step by step .
It would probably be better to start helping the communities rather than just concentrating on the future .
If the communities do n't exist , there will be no more social lives in the world .

The statement is quite true .
In the 21st country , many people are very busy doing their own works or jobs .
They hardly have time to helping out their communities .
Their role is not only helping their communities but also making a hopeful world .
They have got lots of things to do and accomplish .
However , they have to bear in mind that working for communities are not the thing of wasting time , it is worth it .
