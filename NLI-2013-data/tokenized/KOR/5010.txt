I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
If the advertisements fail to show the products ' virtue , why are the manufacturers advertising their products every day ?
It is the basic function of the advertisement .
Comercials are trying to exaggerate the virtue of products in two ways .

First , using the characteristics of media .
Television , newspaper , and megazine are adapting every possible visual effects on their advertisements in order to show the products brighter than they are .
They using lightings and computer based image reprocessing technoligies .
There are lots of new thechnoligy used in the advertisements that makes it possible products can be seen as totally different styles and shapes .
Hence , customers usually disappointed with the real shape and color of the products , Especially for economic product with ceap materials .

Second , showing just good part of the products .
Even though the advertisement do not lie to customers , exposing only the good part of products means hiding the worse part of the products .
Hence , if the public see the advertisements , they may think the products are amazing one without any problem .
It is the reason why some sophisticate customers try to find rates of other customers for the product they plan to buy .
The customers who already used the products can give more accurate information , both pros and cons .
It means customers hardly find bad aspects of the products on their comercials .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the idea that advertisemens makes products seem much better than they really are .
Although advertisements of products can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customers with wrong images .
