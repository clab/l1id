There is an arguement concerning whether it is beneficial for people to have broad knowledge of many fields or to specialize in one particular subject .
Although it is true that one specific knowledge can be more efficient , I believe that broad knowledge has many advantages .
In this essay , I will briefly two reasons supporting my idea .

Most of all , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can study their own fields .
In particular , in the science research , scientist who have a variety of knowledge can be obtain ideas about his research from different subjects .
For example , I read an article of one physicist whom I do not remember his name .
He said that he often gain his ideas about physics research from literature .
Besides , the paradigm of subject are shifted in 21st centry .
In 21th centry , many subjects are combined with other subjects which are not related them .
For instance , physicist can adjust his knowledge to the medical science or biology , and economist can use scientific methods to analize economic materials .
In this respect , knowing many academic subjects have many benefits to study .

Moreover , having broad knowledge can make life more plentiful .
Particularly , person who have many academic subjects can talk and discuss with people who have different jobs or major .
Therefore , he can enjoy various kinds of subjects and make friends who is in different field .
This make his life more exciting and plentiful .
Besides , people who have different subjects with their major can applicate this knowledge his level of living better .
For example , my uncle is professor of biology but he also knows well about economy .
He adjust his knowledge about economy to invest stock , and he earn mucy money .

In conclusion , having a wide range of knowledge is better on account of reasons that I mentioned above : various knowledge can contribute to not only the reseach and study in many fields , but also make more plentiful life .
