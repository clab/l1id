I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because that is the reason why the advertisements really are .
In almost all advertisements we can see only the good sides of the product .
We can only see the side effects or bad consequences only when there is any law or regulations that they should indicate them like tabbaco or medicine .
Advertisers want to sell their product more and more and have to compete with the product of other companies .
So they show the good-looking product with great function and hide the defects .

And another reason is that the advertisements are made in the best circumstances in which the product can function most effectively .
For example , in the clothing advertisement we can see the idealy good shaped person wearing the product .
And we imagine the look that we are going to have with that clothes similar to the advertisement and come to buy the product .
That is why I agree with this statement .
