I oppose to the idea - In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today - .
Nowadays , there are a lot of cars running on the roads , however from one research , only 10 % of the people in the world have a car , which means we still have lots of developing conturies needing more cars .

There are huge amount of possibility of developing contries , such as China and other asia contries .
Their economy raising speed is over 10 % per each year .
If we think about the population of China , we would agree of my thought .
The number is unbelivablely high number .
I heard from international student from China that lots of people are working hard and want to get a nicer car .

Apart from the idea of that people become rich can buy more cars , cars are getting reconised as a necessary product .
People have been saying that there is no more development from in a short time , and suppose that there will be no more gasolin , however , whenever there used to be new technologes invented .
Car 's are the same cases .
As the thchnical flow in the world , which the world is going to be lack of gasolin , the new style of cars will be invented , and even at the moment , we are useing the water as gasolin .

On top of that , cars are called by `` adult toy '' .
It can be understanded cars are not that special product , which everybody can use just as a method of moving .
I suppose that after twenty yesrs , children can even get drive license ,

Thus ,
