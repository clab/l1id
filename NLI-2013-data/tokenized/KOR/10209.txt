At present , I donate some money to the Foundation of Bill Gates as a sponsor to be able to help AIDS patients who have suffered in the South Africa .
As we know , Bill Gates who is a founder in the company of Microsoft established to AIDS foundation to spend an enormous money for the AIDS patients and support them to get a better life by the appropriate treatment .
He is already one of the billionares in the world with a fame .
However , he is turning to others ' lives to help them without personal greed and seeking only prestiges .
He has already got almost all things whatever he really want to achieve .
However , he is not satisfied with these materialism , he is trying to turn the poor and suffering people with AIDS to share his wealth .
I think he is the most powerful , respectful and admirable person in the world because he has a good personality to take care of others such as AIDS patients not just instead of caring for his business and his purpose .
If he is doing very well in his own business like Microsoft company , people would not say he is being success or prominent person .
Many people who are aroun me , they are successful and outstanding in their field such as lawyers , doctors , and bussinessmen .
However , they all are trying to do new things without staying convenient situation .
They try to help people who have suffered with various diseases as a free doctor and to act as a probono lawyer for the disabled .
There are so many successful people in the world , most of them are usually doing decent something for others b
