Those who dose belive that younge people spent very much time to do for their communities .
However , I might say that young people recently do not give enough time to taking care of the sociey which they belongs .
There are several resons : to spent their own time for their future and to share time with peers .

First of all , young people are supposed to spent their own time for their future .
You might say that young people want to spent time to do something for their communities .
However , you may not deny that it is critical for them to develop their ability for their future .
As society is getting more complex , the required ablility to survive in the dog-eat-dog society is more complicated .
Therefore , the role of young people has been changed .
It was to consider other peole and their communities but now it is to concentrate for own achivement and success life in the future .

Moreover , young people want to share time with peers .
By being with peers , they can feel comfortable and have fun with similar interest stuff .
They enable not only to coperate with friends for some project and but also to become sociable to make their own rules and roles within the peer groups .
For instnace my sister does not volunteer for her communitis , however she enthusiatically worked in peer group study everyday to prepare her project in school .
Then she could get `` A+ '' in the project .

To sum up , I agree that young people spend most time for ouw
