Today , the method of teaching is mainly discussing in all around world .
I think understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts because of two reasons ; effectiveness to another proplem , and make a considerated person .

First , if we understand ideas that on the book , or the profeesor explained we can easily get a solution from similar situations or problems .
For example , we have learned ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' . we know not only this answers but also its sequence to solve .
Unless we underatand the method .
` 1 + 1 = 2 ' is just fact .
not mine .

Secondly , we can be more considerating person .
By accessing solutions , we could face various kinds of obstacle .
Then , we take a time to review about waht was wrong and are there any otherway to solve the problem

In conclusion , there is a saying that `` teach him ` how to get fish ' , do n't teach him ` how to eat fish ''' .
This shows what I exactly mean .
Ignore all of the sequence is caused unhumanty soceity and unconsiderating society .
Therefore I think to understand ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts .
