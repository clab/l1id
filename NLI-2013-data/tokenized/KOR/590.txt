Some people say being a specialist in a specific field is most important thing in the ever-changing society .
However , I strongly believe that having broad academic knowlege is much important than being a specialist .

First of all , learning wide knowledge of various subjects is helpful to be well-rounded people and have a good relationship with others .
When people learn the only one subject , they are well fitted in the field , but might not be a general people who mingle with any others .
For example , Tae-hun Kim , who is my university friend , is on psychology major .
He did not know about any other subject .
Some day when I ask other friends to join a party in Kim 's house , they answered reluctantly .
I knew why they did .
That was because Kim always talks only about psychologic issue .

On top of that , it is beneficial not only to social relationship , but also to get good job in these day .
Many company want to recruit versatil people who can be adjusted any department .
Some department needs speicialists , but most of departments teach new people to work together .
When people even want to make their own company , it will be more a helpful to be a this kind of versatil man .
For instance , despite my brother 's major is computer science , he tried to learn management and economics when he want to build his own computer software company .
He already had good computer skills but he also needed management skill to manage his company , and economics ' insight to read the current market flow .
Now he is a one of the most famous CEO of a young venture company .

In brief , learning diverse knowledge have a positive effect on people 's relationship and getting a good job .
People should learn diverse kind of academic subject to be more well rounded people and have various knowledge to jet
