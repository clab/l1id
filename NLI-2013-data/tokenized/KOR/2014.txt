The question depends on how people keep in their mind which one is better for their life .
To get a confortable life after young people become older people , they work very hard to get a lot of money .
On the other hand , after some people enjoy their life when they are young , they work very hard to handle their family or theirself .

In my case , I totally disagree that young people spend a time to enjoy their life more than elder people do through my experiance .

I am taking a TOEFL test to get into a graduate school from Massachusatts Institute Technology in boston .
Over the past 7 years , I graduates college with my greate reputation .
I got a shcolarship for 4years , and then I got a job in the military as a first lietaneunt for 3 years .
Moreover , I did not satisfy my life at that time .
so I am challenging for my life to get better than before .
This period time is very significant to drive my life .
`` Do I enjoy my life righ now ? ''
It is really hurt to keep doing my situation .

To support my future life and my family , I am definitely supposed to work very hard and to get a job for my life .
Usually , in Korea , almost all young college students would like to hang around and to enjoy with their freinds when they are college students .
However , they never spend their time inefficient in campus because all of people want to get a job more than they expected their job due to prepare their future .

At the end , When young people study very hard to get a their job and work their company their future , older people enjoy their life with their erned money when they were young such as to play golf , tennis , skiing and travel so on .
My parents are also spending their time to travel , to play golf and to get a their hobby .
They are enjoy their life more than me .
Therefore , I want that situation as my parents who prepare their future when they were young .
