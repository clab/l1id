I have always been and still is an `` understanding '' kid .
I could never learn the facts as `` such and such is such preiod . ''
I had to think about it until I knew and understood the main reason why such and such is such and such .
It was a good habit of studying for when there were comprehensive questions , I would find it easy to apply the things I learned in to real-life settings .
Once understood , I would then be able to learn higher level knowledge on the same topic .
Things I tried to memorize as facts never semmed to sink-in and stay .
It is because of my personal experience that I agree with the statement , `` It is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

First , in present day life , you ca n't always learn facts and memorize it .
In the past accepting and learning facts were the means of education .
However , now it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts .
Every now and then we here about the imp [ ortance of creativity .
Creativity comes from understanding ideas and concepts and applying them to situations to make new things , handle the hard problems in the situation , and make new ideas .
In present day life , you the ablitiy to understand is important especially to growing students .

Second , the `` facts '' are always changing .
It was a fact that the no man could ever reach the moon befora the space shuttle was invented .
It was a `` fact '' that the Earth was the center of the universe couple centries ago .
The `` facts '' change as people learn more and more about their surroundings .
If the facts are learned without students actually understanding the concept , it would be hard for them to take in the new `` facts '' or understand why the fact has changed .
Also , it would be impossible to have great scientists if all students belived that facts are facts and none of them will ever change becaus they learned it this way .

Last , it is a more effective way of studying .
For students who have a limited amount of time to study 8 to12 subjects time efficientcy is very important .
By understanding a concept or ideas the students can take in all the things that are related to that subject .

Because of the reasons stated above , I agrree with the statement , `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
