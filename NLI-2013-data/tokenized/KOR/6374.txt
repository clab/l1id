Fist of all , we need to think about envoirement .
So my anwer is definitly `` Yes , I agree . ''

Of course , everything was very easy and possible because of cars .
They 're really usefull and convinent .
And we are already good at that situation .
This means it will be very difficult us to give up driving cars .
But we know the first period of life on the earth , people did not die .
They could live .
I want to say it could be a habit just for us .

Habits can be change by efforts .
But the envoirement which was distroyed by human being cannot be recorver .
I 'm sure about the judgement which we have to choose .
No one will give up their life .
But everyone can change their life style for their serious health problems .
What kinds of thing will be instead of cars ?
I want to suggest bicycle !
For the both of a good envoirement and a health , it 's really good .
Many people also have good memories which connected with childhood and bicycle ...

We have to care about our future
