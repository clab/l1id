I agree with the statement about traveling with the tourguide with a group is the best way .
Because of the following reasons .
You can learn lots of information about the famous places .
I t 's cheap , you wo n't be lonely during the travel .
And you wo n't have problem talking to the foreigners .
These are the following reasons and examples to the question .

The first reason is that by traveling with a tour guide , you can learn many new information about the famous places you are traveling .
The tour guide can expain all the important things and history about the place and help you understand more easily .

Second reason is that it is cheaper when you are traveling in a group rather than yourself .
You can save a lot of money and if you are a student this can be the advantage to save money .
MONEY is really valuable , that is why everybody is saving them .
I once visited italy with school friends when i was young , We saved alot of money .

Third reason is that you wo n't be loney during the journey .
When i was traveling around italy with my friends i saw some people traveling alone and i thought that they looked really loney .
When you are with the group you can chat and discuss how you feel about what you see and stuff .
And also you can make good relationship with the members of the group .
You can talk to friends you have never talked with .
I made alot of friends while i was traveling and i 'm still in contact with one too .

Finally , sometimes when you are traveling alone , you can face problems talking with the residents that live on that country or any other foeigners .
At this point a tour guide is very useful .
He can translate and talk to them at your point of view .
You can be confident with no frustration .

For the conclusion i think traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better because you can gain many thing .
Information , save money , make new friends and be confident .
