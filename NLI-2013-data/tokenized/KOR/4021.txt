Do young people nowadays do n't spent enough time in helping their communities ?
I strongly agree with the speaker in few points .
First of all , the youth nowadays simply do not have to help their communities because of they lack the interest of their communities .
Because of the arise of the individualism they now focus on their own self-interest and happiness .
We now see alot of young people just enjoying their lifes or prparing for their future carreers .
They do n't have time to look after their communities or those who are sick and poor .
Many of them just simply enjoy going to parties and get drunk and give their time in making girl-or-boy friends .

Second , the young nowadays do n't have time to help and participate in helping their communities even though they are interested in helping others .
They are unfortuantley caught up in their school 's study or assignment in order to survive in our over competivive society .
They get up early in the morning for school and they might attend after school activity or academic insitutions that will help their courses .
Many young student work in a part-time job to finance their tuition and board .

Lastly , even though some students do spend some time in helping their communities , it is not a long term participation but becoming more of an one time event without enthusiasim or passion .
Because of the economic growth and increased the notion of quaility of life , they do n't feel the real need to help others who are disadvataged .
They were hardly never in a situation when they hungry without food and with no place to sleep .
This might be a reason for them to actually not to have some sympathy towards helping others which might make them less active .

In sum , because of the reasons stated above I strongly think that the youth nowadays lack time , interest and effort in a long-term activity in helping their communuities .
