Global warming , cold , the ozone layer becoming thinner ...
etc .
What do you think is causing these problems ?
Yes .
It 's mostly because of cars .
We all know that cars are polluting environment and causes many diseases .
And yet , we 're still using cars very often .
Why ?
It 's because it 's fast and comfortable when it takes us to our destination .

I disagree that there will be fewer cars 20 years later .
In my opinion , even the time goes to 2026 , the cars will still be our number one trasportion .
There are some reasons why I think this way .

First , cars are very fast .
It 's much fast than running and walking and biking .
Even though there are buses and trains , it 's crowdy and also too big and slow for us to use for our daily lives .
But cars are different .
It 's fast and comfortable .
It can took us to the destination in short period of time .
Unless we can invent transportation which is as fast and comfortalble as car , I think we will still use car in 2026 .

Second , cars are private for one or one 's family .
You ca n't really talk private things in the bus and train because it can annoy people around you .
Also , you ca n't really talk privately since there are many people listening .
However , in car , you can talk freely since there are only your mate or your family in the space .
Not to mention that you can use car anytime you want .

Third , cars have unique design .
Some rich people even collect many cars .
Unlike other transportation , you can decorate your car in what fassion or color you like because it 's quite small and cheaper than the other transportation .
Nowadays , as technology developed , you can also do many things in car .
For example , you can listen to music , watch TV , cook some food , etc .
I think even the time flows 20 years , we will still ca n't find transportation like cars , which has unique design and many uses .

I think cars are great transportation to humans even though time flows to 2026 .
But , polluting the environment got to be stopped .
Many scientists are developing new ways to find resourses , such as solar energy , wind energy , tide energy and so on .
I hope to see a wonderful car without polluting air in 2026 .
