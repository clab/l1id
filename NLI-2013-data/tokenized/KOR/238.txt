Travel can be a good present to a person who is tired or bored with an ordinary busy life .
It can be a time for a new adventure or a time for taking a rest .
Some people prefer traveling with a group and a tour guide .
Others choose a trip by themselves or with their family and friends .
Personally , I prefer to travel with my family and friend or just by myself without a tourguide .

Trip in a group with a tour guide can be cheaper because of possible group discounts and agency deals .
Also , I do n't need to do my research for the place I want to visit during the trip .
All I need to do is to show up the place where I am supposed to meet a group and a tour guide and to follow predetermined schedule .
It sounds very convenient .
However , there is limited freedom in a group tour .
I may not visit the places I wish to go , must wait for others , can not eat the restaurant I choose , and can not change schedules even if I want to .
Furthermore , I am usually not able to choose a group I am with nor a tour guide .
If I am unlucky , that trip can be a pain to bear with somebody uncomfortable .

When I was in school , I visited Bangkok with a group led by a tour guide .
The reason I chose the group tour was that it was a very good deal .
There were 35 individuals in my group in different ages .
Frankly speaking , it was very unpleasant because there were some people distracted .
They spent too much time on shopping and rest of us had to wait for them .
Because a tour guide get a commission , he did n't stop them rather encourage them to purchase more .
I wasted a lot of time in the bus waiting for others .
Also , I could n't eat the restaurant I wanted to eat .
I could n't stay a place long enough I enjoy the view .

Besides of above reasons I pointed out , I want to have some good memories which will last long after the trip .
For a group tour , I do n't need to do any research for the trip except checking schedules .
Thus , there are not a lot of memories I can have later .
I would like to have a travel with full of unpredicted events .
I may visit places nobody else visit since no tour guide goes there .
There could be some challenges .
But through overcoming them , I will improve myself more .
Thus , the best way to travel for me is definitely not in a goup led by a tour guide .
