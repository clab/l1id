I ca n't agree with the statement .
In my opinion .
In the future , there will be more cars in the world even though there are some tasks to solve .

At first , we need to concerntrait on the natural resources .
The human beings are used it without a long term vision , so they will be almost used up in next 20 years .
But , there are lots of studies which try to find another energy sources .
For examole , gain oil from natural grains , using sun energy , and using the wind .
The most interesting thing is Hydrogen .
It 's source is water which is really fruent in earth .

( Actually , the Hydrogen cell is only meterial problem now . )
So , human being will find another energy resources in twenty years , I sure .

Second , China , africa , and India will have lots of cars in 20 years .
As you know they did n't boot their real economic engins .
As many economic specialist says , they will have rapid grow .
So , they will have a lot of new cars .

At last , like a hybrid technaligy there are many methodes which can enhance the efficiency of cars .

The more cars means the more happiness in the world ?
The more advance in technaligies means the more happiness ?
I ca n't answer the questions .
A important thing is we have to a master of technaligies , in my think .

thank you for reading ..
