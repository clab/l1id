I disagree with it , because it 's also a sort of lying to their customers .
I understand that they are trying to sell their products alot , but they have to think about their customer to not be disappointed .

I really enjoy watching TV , and there are lots of advertisements during the show break .
Watching those advertisements make me laugh , because I know that things will never happen .
Few years ago , I saw an advertisement of a hair shampoo on TV , so I decided to try that because I thought my hair would be like the models on TV .
I bought that shampoo , and tried .
On the first day , I did not see any difference , so I though it takes a while to be silky .
I waited .
Nothing happened .
That shampoo was same as the other products .
Not one thing was different or special except the nice smell .
I 've been using it for few years now , but still , nothing seems to happen .

They are really trying hard to grap people 's attention , but advertising to trick people is not good .
Some people will not care much , but some people can be serious .
When they advertise , they have to think about their customers ' feeling , or make their products like it is on the advertisement .
