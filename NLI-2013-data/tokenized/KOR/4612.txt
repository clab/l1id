To make advertising is for increasing sell the product .
I know the purpose to make the advertising .
Howevery , there are many disadventage to buy some product from just watching the advertising .
I bought some clothes in the internet shopping mall .
Thase are so pretty when I see the clothes on the monitor , but i disapointed the real product , color is different from the monitoer. , and when I saw the clothes , it looked very sleem .
Anyway , I do n't believe any advertising any more .

I can examplify some unbeievable reasons .
They sometimes said not real fuctions .
For example , there is a advertising on TV that hires very famous an beliverable persons , such as movie stars , sports men or scientist .
We can believe that the person tell anything , whether they say the ture or not .
The belife does n't come from the function or effection of the product , but from he believerable person .
It is just trick .
If someone the watch a advertising about car on the TV , and engeenior says that the car can safe your life and give a exeriment in the advertising .
We can beleived his speaking .

Some diet drugs , they show the ficture about before and after .
and hire nutrieceion .
Another example , they sometimes use the exaggeration in the advertising .
There are a car that is showing faster than the airplain according the computer graphic .
We can realize that it is not true , but sometimes we believe the fact that the car is fastest car in the world , because no one compares to the arirplaon before .

So , I agree this sencence , It is the reason to make the advertising .
We should have the ability do distingush between the fact and the exaggeration for exceed selling rate , increasingly .
