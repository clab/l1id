Young people only care about themselves .
Their families , friedns , and schools are what is important to them , not some community services they would not even get paid for .
This is one stereotype that most adults or elder people believe in .
However , as a teenager , I disagree with that for there are young people concerned in helping their communities .

Yes , it is true that young people , majority of them being students like myself , focus more on their academics and work .
Nevertheless , academics is not the only brick that builds up one 's character .
Several schools , which acknowledge the different values for composing an ideal person , provides the opportunities for their students to help their communities by going on field trips to a local site or encouraging students to join clubs that do community services regularly .
In my school , International School Manila , this happens every single year - I have participated in both the field trips and club activities , such as visiting the orphanage for disabled children ( Chosen Children Village ) .
Through interaction with people , who have lower living standards than themselves , students definitely learn `` the other side of the world , '' of which they have not been able to see yet .
In addition , helping those people inspire a great sympathy that the student bodies cannot gain by spending hours on the desk , naturally leading them to return to their communities .

Even in these days , when young people give more significance to their studies , there are still some out there , contributing their time to help their communities and earn a pure happiness in return .
