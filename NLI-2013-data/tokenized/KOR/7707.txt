About a couple of years ago , My friend and I went trip to Australia and NewZealand for 2 weeks .
We went in a group of 20 people led by a korean tour guide .
People in a group including us visited the same places at a time and we had a same meal everytime .
I thought that it was totally ridiculous and I paid money in vain .
We could n't even enjoy things that we could have .
It is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip .

There is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide .
First of all , It just gets rid of my interests about the touring places .
A tour guide tells us everything , and we should go places only where the tour guide leads us .
There can be many things that I am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out .
As far as I am concerned , I usually search some informations before I do something .
In fact , I did n't know that I am supposed to go in a group .
I expected that I go with my friends I found many informations about the Australia and NewZealand such as famous places , fees that I have to pay , the climates , transportations and so on ..
And I prepared some plan to go and have some special meals .
But it was just a dream .

If we go trips not in a group , but indivually , we could go places where we wanted .
We could do things flexibly and do n't have to take up useless time .
It makes me have foods that I really wanted .
There are many things to see that we need to take some time .
It simply enables us to do it .
Going individually could really help us enjoy the whole trip .
