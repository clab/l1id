Nowadays , some people prefer to travel through a travel agency while others prefer to travel by themselves .
There are some advantage traveling in group led by a tour guide such as safety and getting some informations about the place we travel from a tour guide On the other hand , there are some disadvantage such as following rules and no private time .
I prefer to trevel in a group led by tour guide .
There are three reasons why i prefer to travel through a travel agency .

The first reason is that I am worrying about safety when I travel .
if we travel in a group , it is safer than travel by myself .
I heard some tragic story about a couple in China .
The couple who just got married in Korea , they went to China for a honeymoon .
But , they did not travel through a travel agency .
They took a taxi and they abruptly disappeared .
After that , thier dead body found in some area without their all of organs .
This story makes me scare to travel .
However , if i join the tour group , it is safe as long as i stay with them .

The second reason is that as traveling with a tour guide who knows well the place we travel , it is more convinient .
We will not lost ways , also the guide knows which store is cheap to buy souvenirs .
If i travel by myself , i do not know which shop is better to buy souvenirs , so that i could pay extra .

Lastly , traveling through agency is cheapter than I travel by myself .
Because the agencyis probably connected to many hotels and resorts .
Thus , we can get some discount from them .
Moreover , we can get discount for the flight tickets .

In conclusion , safety , cheaper price and convinence to find anything with a tour guide are why i prefer to travel in a grould led by a tour guide .
Not worrying about safety and saving money are helpful to enjo
