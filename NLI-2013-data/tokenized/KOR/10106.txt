Most people are about to do what they already know how to do well , or follwo what other people did .
For example , most people are about to do the same way that someone changed his or her hairstyle , and after all the hairstyle is popular in all of the world .
This is important because those who have followed the population like hairstyle what I said above are existed as general people in the world .
However , those who try to change doing new things or inventing something are soccessful people like he or she who changed his or her hairstyle above .
Then , we need to know why those who try now things are successful people .
I think that successs is up to creativity .
For example , without light bulbs , it 's hard for us to live especially into darkness , and they were invented by Edison , so Edison was a successful person , but we are just general people who use those things to be comfortable .
Tring to make new things has a purpose that makes other people who are about to use the new things be comfortable or useful .
It 's also work that can change the flow of the world .
After all , success is just not only earning much money , but also makes others live comfortably .
Then , What factors do we need in order to be successful people who try new things ?
First , be creative thinking how people are comfortable if you make new things .
Next , think about what the world needs from you who try to make new things .
Finally , be confident about making new things even though you are responsible about how your new things impact in the world .
I think that even though your new things are failed , it 's very better experience .
Therefore , rather than doing what other successful people made something , creatively think about tring to make new things that can impact among all of the world , then challenge into the world in order to show how your ability that is possible to be a successful person is existed in the world .
