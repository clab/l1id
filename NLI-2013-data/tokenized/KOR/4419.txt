I agree with the statement completely .
These days , there are various kinds of advertisements in the world .
It is truth that those advertisements make a product seem the best one in the world .
There could be sveral methods of advertising the product , such as using beutiful models and using the time pressure .

First of all , in America , there are a tons of advertisement on television .
I think Amerians are used to watching those advertisement without any opinions ; in other word , even though the product which are showing on TV looks good for them , people who are whatching it do not believe easily .
However , I had experiance about that .
When I came to Amerian .
every advertisements were very attrative in my mind , when I saw one scean for advertising pants with a wonderful model , I really wanted to have the pants becuase I thought I would looked like the model when I worn the pants .
However , my thought was completely wrong .
When I tried on it , it looked like much fatter than wering the other pants .
Through this experience , I realized that most advertisements exagerate their products with particular objects .
In addition , most advertisements show for very short time on TV .
Short time make people not think carefully ; in other word , when we watch the advertisement , we have to quickly judge whether the product is appropriate or not .
it also easy to misunderstand about the product , so we could remember the product would be much better than they really are .

Although most advertisements exagerate their products , it is difficult to avoid the situation .
I think we have to know how to distinguish between the true and worng aspects when we buy some products by advertisements .
