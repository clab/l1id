Advertisements , which are important in selling products , make products seem better than they are in order to make it more appealing to consumers .
Advertisers use many tricks and even false information to make the products seem better .
Advertisements use aspects that appeal to people 's senses , such as the way the product looks , smells , or feels .

Most advertisements use vivid imagery to attract attention .
Advertisers enhance the appearance of the product by different effects such as lighting or coloring .
Commericials for food products sometimes do not use the real product , but a imitation that is made unrealisitically .
For instance , when advertising a hamburger , advertisers might use a bigger or a more fresh looking imitation of the hamburger .
When a person actually goes to buy the product , they will notice a significant difference in the real product in comparison to the product shown in the commericial .

Also , many advertisements use claims that are usually false .
The advertisement might imply that the product makes a person looks more beautiful or has the power to make someone smarter .
A commercial for perfume might imply that the person using the product gains more attention from people .
However , these claims are highly exaggerated to make the product popular among customers .

Advertisers use people 's weakness to appeal to them .
For example , an advertisement commericializing a product that can lead to weight loss might show someone who is obese so that the consumer can relate to the advertisement and be convinced into buying the product .
It is important for the consumer to question the product objectively .

In conclusion , by different effects and methods , advertisements enhance the quality of the product , making it seem better than it actually is .
This is to strengthen the purpose of the advertisements , which is to sell the product to many people .
