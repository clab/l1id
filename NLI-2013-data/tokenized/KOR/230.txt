There are many ways to travel but the one way that I most prefer is to travel is in a group by a tour guide .
Therefore , I agree with the following statement .

First , the tour guides are able to help us .
When we go with tour guides , they knew where are the best places and the most popluar places that travellers go , so we can go the places that are popular and places so we do n't have to spend much of time by going unpopular places and un neccessary to go .
Also , the travel with the tour guides are more comfortable .
For example , the tour guides are able to speak the language that you traveled so we do n't have to spend time by having a conversation problem and they also know .

Second , we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them .
When I traveled to Europe .
I met a lot of people in there .
There is a person who live in island and someone who lives far away from me .
While we move to other country or city we always have to spend five to four hour by riding a bus so we played variety games and we became freinds on a last day of the trip .
After the trip we traded each others address , telephon number and e-mail .
Also , after that when I visited the island that one of the member lives I had a luch with them and talked about the Europe trip that we had a few month ago and we trade each others photos by sending e-mail .

I like the travel that in a led by a tour guide because the tour guides are able to help us and we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them but I think what ever way it is travel gives so many rememberable remembers !
