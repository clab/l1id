Being a ` specialist ' or a ` generalist ' , is a ongoing debatable question .
To be the best on one part , is a great job .
But the advantages of being a specialist outweigh the disadvantages .
The rationale behind is that specialist could be and generalists are more required in modern sociey .

People usually respect the person who have great influences on their job .
In modern society , however , the person who can deal with many parts are more required .
From my personal experiens , when I paid attention to many parts on subject , I had good grade on test .
According to newspapers , in addition , universites suggest that student have two majors .
Students who have two magars outdo students who have only one major .
In a bookstore , there are many books about science-humanity and art - science .
In this sense , it is necessary to expand our knoweldge of many academic subjects .

Broaden knowledge makes people have a various of view on problems .
Stucking on only one subject maybe become narrow opinion .
By studying diverse academic areas , people can understand and have many opinions on issues .
