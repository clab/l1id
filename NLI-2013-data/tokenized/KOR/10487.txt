Successful people try to new work or create one is better than do only what they know .
I agree this quote .
Pixar comany and JYP is one of successful people .
Successful people try new thing is better than only doing one work .

First , Pixar is one of famous film comapany .
This company always make to new idea and story .
people try to using diffrent to techinq .
However , If this famous company pixar always make to same sotry and same idea for flim , watching poeple does not interesting about that film anymore .
Theseday people want to new one and different style like poeple want to new cell phone or many option thing .
So , successful people need to try new create amd running to their line .

Second , JYP is famous singer or writer musican in Korea .
In Korea , since 1994 he always make to shocking musoc and creat to new singer .
JYP does not stay same work or day in Korea .
He try to sell his music in New York .
That time , Aisa musician try to sell their music but they are always go back to their country .
However , like that situation JYP do not give up his work .
He look back for asia muscian failthing .
He know , they did same work like their success in thier country and used to same way in New York .
So , He change to his mind and make to creat music not same , He can sell his music to Will Smith and Mase .
He can becaom first Aisan sell music in New York .
Theseday , He still in New York and He doing new project .

He just not sing and writer music in Korea , he look for new work and try .
Like that , Succeddfaul people have know move thier place .
Thefore , Who people success dose not stay their same place , they try to new place or work is better than that .
