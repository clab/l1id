Whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities or not is controversial .
Some point out that they are quite busy to give helpness to their society while others insist that they would be great hands to help the communities .
I strongy disagree with the opinion that youth does not give enough time to helping their communities .

First , they would pay close attention to society where they belong to , even though there are a lot of burdens they have to deal with by themselves .
Here is an example .
In my case , as a university student , I have worked for youth organization which is for helping young generation .
One of what I have done was to participate in the summer camp for people who do not have parents or any relatives .
The action I have achieved was to be a sister for them and take care of them .
I insist that there might be plenty of volunteers who join the youth group as a one of the young people .

Second , young people are willing to get involved in their juniors to give advices in school .
I have been helped by my predecessors in regard to the homework which I could not solve by alone and the way to reach the dream I have held .
They gave me various information making me intelligent and stimulated me to fulfill my goal .
In addition , now I am giving helpness and many kinds of advices to my juniors as my predecessors did .
It means that young people are delighted to helping their school .

To sum up , Young people , especially getting involved in the school , organization in the current society give sufficient time to help their communities .
There is no doubt in my mind that young people play important roles in their group .
