There has been an argument regarding the issue that the best way to travel is a tour in a group generated by using tour agencies .
Some people maintain that it is very beneficial to travel because it is cheaper and safer than traveling alone .
However , I believe that traveling in a group is not effective way to appreciate foreign cultures .
In this essay , I will present two reasons for my idea .

First of all , traveling with group members impose restrict regulations to tourists .
In general , each person has their own personal preference .
People usually set priorities on different issues .
To contend these various demands , schedules should be set by their own .
However , tour guides cannot provide flexible regulations to people .
This is because all of the schedules and regulations set by tour guides are focused to group people .
For example , when I traveled in Paris by using a group tour , I had really wanted to go to Montrematre , famous streets in Paris .
However , tour agency stronly opposed to my idea because there is dangerous place to foriegn tourists .
In addition , no other person did not join to my plan , so I finally gave up to visit there .

Seconly , touring in groups cannot provide wonderful memories to people .
Generally speaking , one of the most important reasons that spring to people 's minds in relation to travel is enjoyable memory .
If the person go to seesighting alone , it is common knowledge that visiting strange places has high possibilities to face accidents .
However , people are dare to want to face that sudden accidents , and a result these happenings will be enjoyable memories .
However , if people travel in a group , they will lose a lot of chances to their own memories .
This is due to the fact that almost every tours conducted by tour guides offer limited and regulated schedules .
A study conducted by the Department of Korean Tour Associations shows that seventy percent of Korean young people who once traveled in a group by travel agency answered that they did not satisfied with group travels .

Taking all I mentioned into consideration , I believe that touring in a group by a tour guide is a not best option .
This is because it offers restrict shedule and , cannot meet people 's diverse tastes .
