Nowadays while some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide , others like to travel alone .
Both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages .
In my experience , I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tuor guide for several reasons .

First , traveling in a group led by a tour guide can help me manage my time efficiently .
A guide may know well the famous sites and places which visitors want to go and he can let me know about that within a short time .
For example , when I traveled in Florida a few years ago , at that time I did not know where to go and what to do .
Howeve , my aunt introduced her friend who had a guide job .
She kindly offered me riding and comforable places to relax as well as let me know the most famous places such as Disney World or Sea World .
Thanks to her , I did save my time of sightseeing and spend my free time efficiently .

Second , traveling in a group led by a tour is more enjoyable than traveling alone for me .
In a group , there are many people from different locals or countries .
With these people , I can share a lot of valuable nformation and can listen to their unique experiences .
It is a kind of interesting experience for my life .
When I was a college student , I travel in Canada .
In a group , I made some friends there , and still we keep in contact through email .

Last , traveling in a group led by a tour guide can enable me to save money .
He can tell me about information about the new countries such as how to spend money properly .
If I do not know the local living style , I might spend more money than I would expect .

To conclude , traveling alone or traveling in a group led by a tour guide have both benifits and drawbacks .
However , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide since it can help me make a plan more efficiently and save money and it is more exciting for me .
