Majority people see a lot more advertisement .
Some people say that by seeing the advertisement , they are judged whether they are good product or not .
Howerer , when this topic comes to me , I firmly believe that advertisement has a lot of drawbacks .
Advertisement fosters a instant consume , and a lot of company adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive model payment .
I n addition , through an advertisement , people do n't think which product is good or not .

To begin with , advertisement fosters a instant consume .
When I came to New-york , I was really interested in Victoria Secret advertisement , which made me buy a lot more its products even if I had lot of innerwears already .
I could not saying that the advertisement was the worst thing for me .

What is more , a lot of company adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive payment .
Even though , the price of product is pretty cheap , we have to pay its advertisement fare invisible .
we would be pay more expensive price , considering quality of product .
It goes with out saying that advertisement is really disadvantageous .

Finally , people do n't think anymore which product is good or not .
Especially , the youth prefer to get specific products , such as Nike , Cocacola and ipot ( MP3 ) , etc .
They want to have some products that the famous actor or actresse advertise although it costs a lot of money .
These event may cause social problems .
I may well say that davertisement is harmful for the youth .

To sum up , as might expected , advertisement has many shortcomings as I have mentioned above .
