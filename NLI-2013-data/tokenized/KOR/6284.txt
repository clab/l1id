These days , even in the regions the population are not very a lot , cars are everywhere .
And this caused lots of serious environmental problems and health problems .
So , lots of people are supporting to not to utilize cars .
And also , great amount of public transportation such as subway are increasing .
For these reasons , I agree that in the future , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly , many evidence that cars are not efficient to use and causing problems , many people asserts to not to use cars .
The problem are such as health problems and environmental problem .
Health problem could be occur that people does n't walk because of the convinence of cars .
So that many people are suffering from obesity , and high blood pressure .
Also , lots of evidence that the cause of serious air pollution was cars .
The gas from the cars affected to create harmful gases and it was resulted in destruction of ozone layer , air pollution .
So , recently we can see lots of people who are opposed with utilizing cars on the streets .

And also , as the number of cars rapidly increased , the traffic jam appeared , so lots of people are choosing to ride on public transportation rather than riding a car .
For example , my father had serious problem that he was always late for work .
So , he decided to use subway and gave my mom a car .
A month later , he said that there are no such as a problem that he was late for workplace and the lots of money were saved .

Overall , I agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for following reasons : people are opposing with utilizing cars that they cause serious problems and they are using efficient public transportation .
Even though the numbers of car utilizers are far more than people who oppose to use cars , the government and environmentalist are providing more efficient substitute of cars so that many people are convinced by the new substitute .
