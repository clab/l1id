That is what I have in mind .
Actually most of the successful people must try new things and take a risks rather than only doing what the already know how to do well .
This is because if they did not do like that , they could not succeed .
There are a lot of people who can do very well about something , If someone wants to succeed , he/she has to do something special just like the following statement .

I will show a example about the statement ; about Einstein .
If my memory serves me right , he took lots of risks like earnig money to do something for invention , or studying himself instead of going to school .
At that time , many people criticized him , but now everyone can know him and his inventions , and admire him .
As Einstein did , if we try to succeed we can do .
Unless we do not try , we will fail .
That is why I agree with the following statement .

And the other is about me .
I used to tend to do something easy .
Someday my parents aksed me `` Do you want to study abroad ? '' so i said to them `` Sure .
It will be fantastic `` then they talked to me '' Yes it will be .
but will you be able to do ?
It will have a lot of problem . ''
I thinked about going to America .
and i decided to go America .
since that time , I do not have thedency that makes me do something easy .
It makes me like this .

As I told , if we want to succeed in our whole life , we MUST try .
That is the only way to succeed .
I mean we have a difficulty succeeding in something that we already know how to do well , because the thing that i know how to do veery well , another people knew it just like me .

Personally , the way to succeed is to try new things and take risks .
Like Einstein or the others who are successful people , they might take a risk .
I can be sure about this .
We cannot succeed in our life without any trying or taking a risk
