Some people agree to the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning concepts .
Others think learning facts should come first .
In terms of critical thinking , I have to say understanding ideas and concepts is more helpful and worthy than learning facts .

Based on the field of study , facts are playing a important role .
For instance , if you are a biology student you should know all the terminologies related to the human body in order to explore further topics .
In Art , knowing the differences of Realism and Classicism is the foundation of your knowledge .
Then , you can classify genres and styles of movies .

However , students will not be able to develop critical thinking unless they understand ideas and concepts if they know about only facts .
For example , with a scientific fact is presented in class and no discussion or analyzation is followed to help students understand the concepts , Once students understand the ideas why a certain history event had happened in the past , it would be easy for them to understand the consequenses of that event .

In conclusion , both understanding ideas and concepts ant learning facts are critical in learning .
