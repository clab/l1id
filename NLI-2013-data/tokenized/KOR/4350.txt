These days , many people are willing to help their communities through many ways such as donating clothings or money , However , some people think that young people appears to be putting little time to help , but I disagree with this statement because of two reasons .

Initially , since most young people are more active than the older people , I belive that they have better chances to help thier communities .
For instance , I saw many young people who are doing voluntary works in schools .
They sometimes teach poor people who cannot afford to go to college , and also , they teach poor kids , too .

Also , many young people engage in demonstrations to fight against some unappropriate regulations .
From my experience , some of the young teachers tried to change the company that was supplying for my school 's meals because the quality of the food was not good enough for students .
Because of their effort , my school could change the company and had better quality of food for the meals .

In addition , I think that the campaigns are mostly launched by young people .
For instance , in the church , there are many college students who are helping poor kids around the country by donating cloths .
Also they convince other people to donate by advertising their campaigns .
Sometimes they make posters , or they cook cookies by theirselves to advertise it .

In the conclusion , I think many young peope are giving enough time to help their communities by several ways such as demonstrating to fingt against some unappropriate rules , voluntary works , and donating for poor people .
Therefore , I disagree with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
