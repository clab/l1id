Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
That is true .
That is the way how to sell their products , because people always want to buy better product .
And the advertisements know it , so make the products look better to sell it .

First , the advertisements have to sell their products , so they try to explain about their products .
Then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products , they just want to tell advantages of it .
In the process , they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages .
So they tell other people about their products overly good .
And other people believe what they say , and think about what they heard .
The people will think that product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages .

A good looking is tasting good .
As for products , it is really important how they are looking .
If they look good , then they seems work better or taste better than how they are .
So when people make the products , they make them looking better for cover custumer 's eyes .
And other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good , believing looking good is better than looking bad .

These days , people care so much about the products ' out-looking .
For example , there are many different types of vecumm machines .
They look all different .
And there is a best working one which suck things really well and there is a best looking one which looks strong and fancy , then the best seller would probably be the looking fancy and strong one than really working good one .

Most products seem much better than they really are because that 's how they have made for .
It is a hope for productors and advertisements for selling them better .
