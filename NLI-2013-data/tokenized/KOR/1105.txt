The important of education is emphasized and re-emphasized in our world of 21st century .
As technology develops and histroy gets longer , we are exposed to more things to learn .
Given this fact , is it better to specialize in one specific subject or have a broad knowledge on many academic subjects ?
People 's opinions may vary on this controversial issue , but I believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject .

Generally , people go through 12 to 13 years of education in secondary schools and have another 2 to 4 years of education in college .
As college students , we major in a specific subject such as Interior Design , Psychology or Hotel Management .
Why do we major in only one or two subjects ?
It is because we are unable to learn vast amount of information on varying academic subjects .

People say that we learn from the past .
Let 's look at Sumer , one of the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia between Tigris and Euphrates Rivers .
About 9000 years ago , the period called the `` Neolithic Age '' began in this civilization .
As nomadic people who depended on hunting and gathering for their survival settled to a permant place and started agriculture , their civilization boomed .
Population dramatically increased and their civilization further enhanced .
It was about this time when what is called , `` the specialization of labor '' began .
This means that each people had a job and a role in their society .
Some people concentrated on farming while others made potteries and others carried out religious rituals .
Because no individual could make a living producing all the food , clothings and habitats oneself , the civilization practiced specialization of labor .
Like what our ancestors long before showed , I think each individual should specialize in one subject now a day .
This will further develop our civilization and benefit us as it is more effective than everyone studying the same subjects at a limited level .

Let 's compare our field of education to that of the universe .
If an astronaut makes his way out of our galaxy who 's never done in the past , he 's drawn a significant line in the history of human beings and the universe .
However if the same astronaut visits the moon which has been already executed by many other astronauts , he will just remain as one of the great astronauts .
The same concept goes to education .
If we explore all the areas of academic subjects at a limited level , there will be no development in human beings ' knowledge , but just a repetition of what others have done .
However if we specialize in one specific subject , our knowledge to that specific area will expand .

In conclusion , because noone is able to learn all of the existing subjects at a sophisticated level , I believe it is better to specialize in a specific subject .
This specialization of learning may limit some people to that area of study only , but it is much more efficient and beneficial to human beings as we can develop our knowledge and contribute our learnings to the human beings and our world .
