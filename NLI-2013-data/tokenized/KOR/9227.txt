Understanding and learning are not able to be separated because withouht understanding learning cannot happen and without learning understanding cannot happen as well .
However , there are orders of between understanding and learning .
In my opinion , understanding is more important than learnign because for me , learing means understading facts because without understanding , I cannot learn any of facts that I should learn .
The three reasons that I think understanding is more important than learning are without understanding , learning cannot happen , without understanding , people are easily lost what they are learning and just learning can help people for a moment but as time goes by , most people do n't remember what they learned .
These are the my reasons that understanding ideas and concepets are more important than learning factors .

My first view point is without understanding , learning cannot happen .
For example , when I came to Canada fist time , I learned about Canada 's history and at that time , I could n't understand any of them because I just tried to memorize bunch of factors and l believd that was the way to learn factors .
It was wrong .
After I understood the flow of history , I was able to understand Canada 's history .
With just memorizing or learning some facts from somewhere or someone are impossilbe that people let know about the facts , understading is obviously needed .

In additiotn , wihtout understanding ideas and concepts , people are usually lost what they are learning .
One of my friend did n't know how to solve math problems because he just tried to put several numbers in to the formula that he learned from his teacher .
When he understood why and how the problem could be solved , he was possible to learn about math more .
If he could n't understand the concepts and idead of math , he would not learn about math anymore .

The last reason that people should understand first is as time goes by , people often forget what they learned .
Most korean people do n't remeber what they learned at high schools because they just learned without understanding .
They needed to get into good universities so they learned a lot without understaning the concepts or ideas .
They usually said it was useless .
However , they do remember most of history .
They absoletly learned history but before learning history , most Koreans understood what lettes they are using and where they are living .
Not only koreans remember their history , but also other countries ' people remember most of history of their mother country .
They understood why and how they are living through understanding and life .

Learning facts can help people at a moment but it does n't mean they do understand what they are learning .
Before learning something , we should understand ideas and concepts for effective learning .
