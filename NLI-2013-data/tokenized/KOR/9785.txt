As technology has been developed , many jobs and skills have been created .
For example , Bill gates who is the richest in the world and have company that related to computer program .
History of the company that named ` Microsoft ' is shorter than others .
But Bill gates knew what will the important things become in the world .
And not many people tried to these new part .
That was easy client of computer .
He invented easier client .
And he spread out to average user .
I think that , Like this example , trying new things is better way to become successful people than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Here is some reasons .

First of all , there are less rivals in new things .
For example , there were already a lots of coffee shops .
So many investers struggled to make extraordinary shops .
And also thet have to care location of shop and menu .
Because there are rival shops .
But if someone try to new thing , he do n't have to care about the rival .
As I stated about Bill gates , when the new company developed new things , there were any rivals .
They did n't worry about challenging with other companies .
So Bill gates concentrated on his new things .

Secondly , only doing what they already know how to do well is more dangerous than try new things .
As the age has been changed , important things are changed .
For example , long times ago , laundry was very important .
Because laundry machine was expensive and hard to manager .
So many people used laundry shop .
But nowadays many company invented new and easy laundry machine .
So many people have laundry machine in their house .
And also many owner who have laundry shops had to closs his shop .
For that reason , only doing what they already know how to do well is dangerouse for their work .
Because world trend has been changing .

For those reason , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
