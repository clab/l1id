I agree with the statement , the best way is in a group .
However , i disagree the travel is led by a tour guide .
I think travel in a group has a lot of benefits .

It will be fun than travel alone .
I think travel alone is so boring .
If we travel in a group , we can talk when we are going somewhere .
And we can enjoy the game during the trip .
But if we travel alone , we ca n't play .
we wil spend time quitely .
When we travel , i think fun must be first .

We can help each other .
If someone do n't know something how to do , his or her friend can help him .
If someone ca n't do something because of other one , his friend can do that instead of him .
For example , there are firework at night .
By the way , he is sick or ca n't go out because of his work , then his friends can bring his camera and can take the photo and video for him .

I told you that led by a tour guide is not good .
During the trip , the tour guide explain and teach everything .
Therefore , getting information is so easy .
Then we will forget the information easily .
I think if i get something easily , i also can lose that easily .
We need to prepare information about the place where we go before we travel .
It is my experience .
I prepared information before i went Haha Tower .
And when i went Haha Tower , i could know about that very well .
And it was very interesting .
And you can talk with your friends with that information .
And you can get more information by your friends .

By these reasons , i think to travel in a group without a tour guide is the best way .
