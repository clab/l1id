These day , companies made many new items which is only for women .
There are many iems such as desks , chairs are made simply for women .
In addition , in Korea , there are going to have cars which are only for woman to use it .
However , many people are curious about that if those cars are going to sell a lot .
In my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First of all , now , people are much concern about the enviornment .
As you see , there are many cars are bring about the air pollution problems .
People are hard to breath and even some people are getting illness because of the air pollution .
In addition , there are not much oil left in the earth and price of the oil is much higher than before .
Thus people are hard to afford it because of the high cost .
Now , people are think about their lack of recource and try to conserve it .

Second , as the population grows , people need more area to live in .
If there are many cars , people have to live in much shorter space .
This is because , we need parking areas and roads for those many cars .
Moreover , people want the parks , art gallery near by their living .
Parents want to have a space more for kids .
As you see , in the cities , there are not much places for the kids because of the parking lots and roads .
Thus , people are more willing to build facilities such as libraries , parks rather than building the roads for cars .

In conclusion , I think there will be fewer cars in use because of that people are now concerning about air polution problems , and as population grows , people are think about the space they live in .
They want to have the place which is more beneficial to their childern .
