Travelling in a group led by a tour guide coud be very interesting .
The tour guide is an expert so there is little chance that the group would miss out any tourist attractions that are worth visiting .
However , as far as I 'm concerned , travelling all by myself is much more exciting as it does not stop me from making spontaneous decisions and it also gives me time to think about my life and plan my future .

To begin with , being with a tour guide would mean that I have to follow the schedule that has been drawn up beforehand and this would be very boring for the group of travellers .
They have to visit places that are chosen by the tour guide even though they are not interested in them at all .
For example , I went on a school trip to China recently and we visited many famous gardens in China .
They were all beautiful , of course , but I am not really keen on looking around gardens so the trip was very boring for me .
If I was allowed , I would have visited other places of my choice but obviously , I was not .
Thus , when travelling as a group , it is very inconvenient that no-one is supposed to do any spontaneous actions .

Moreover , to some people , travelling could be very special in respect that it could be a deviation from their normal life .
They may need to take some respite from busy lives they lead .
For instance , I plan to have a gap year once I graduate from the high school and travel Europe all by myself .
This trip would make it possible for me to look back on my past life and it would also give me enough time to think about what I want to do in the future .
It is a lot better to travel alone when you need to ponder over important decisions to be made .
Hence , at some stage in their lives , people need to be solitary while travelling in order to have time to get the new energy to carry on with their lives .

To conclude , I believe that travelling as a group is not quite perfect for some because it restricts people from doing anything at the spur of the moment and also because it is impossible for people to have a quiet time by themselves to cool off their heads if they are with other people .
I do not intend to assert that travelling alone is the best for everyone as it really depends on individual 's personal preference .
The fundamental purpose of travelling is , I think , is to reflect on yourselves and if some people could do this while travelling as a group ,
