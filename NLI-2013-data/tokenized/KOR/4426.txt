There are no question that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Ther are tow major reasons : my experiences and famous studies .

To begin with , I used to use Internet shopping mall because I thought that it could save time and energy .
However , I spent more time and energy than I went shopping to stores .
When I bought somethings I relied on only advertisements .
Products always looked good in advertisement so i paid for that .
However , when i recieved product I always disappointed .
Real product were very different from advertisements .
As a result , I had to request money back .
Now I do not use internet shopping mall .

Moreover , according to the studies , those who make product use computer and special things to their products in order to look good .
They say that people who buy their products do not realize different things and even though they realize this the percent of money back is very low .
Since these reasons those who make product try to look better in advertisement than real .

In sum up with , according to the my experience and studies , most advertisemensts make products semm much better than really are .
