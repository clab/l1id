The question being asked is if traveling in a group with a tour guide is a best type of tour .
This issue is important because it has several implications on which type of travel people should have .
I believe that traveling in a group with a guide is not always good .

One reason I believe this is that people have different preferences .
In a group tour , each person needs to follow the group 's plan even though the plan does not care of what he or she wants .
While traveling around France , for example , artists want to visit museums but cooks want to go to fine restaurants .
In a group tour , it is very difficult to satisfy the wishes of every member in the group .

Another reason I do not think that a group tour is best is that people do not have time enough to do what they really like to do in a group tour .
The itinerary of a group tour cannot be flexible very much .
The guide and tourists need to adhere to the existing plan .
While traveling , if you find a fascinating place , you would want to stay for a day or two .
In a group tour , it is almost impossible to change the plan .
This could reduce the true value of traveling .

Finally , I am not a proponent of a group tour because people could lose wonderful opportunities to see and make friends with the people who live in other places .
When you travel on your own , you tend to try to understand the town and its people that you visit .
In a group tour , you may be too busy to do this , following the group 's plan .
Traveling alone is very good more often than not .

In conclusion , I do not agree that a group tour led by a guide is the best way to travel .
That is becasue a group tour has its own shortcoming .
Furthermore , I think that traveling alone is quite a good experience .
