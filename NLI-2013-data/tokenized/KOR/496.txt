I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are several reasons why I think this way .
In this essay , I am going to talk about them .

First , we can apply those broad knowledge base of many academic subjects to further learnings .
Without basic broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it can be hard to learn new things because what we only know well is only one specific subject .
In this sense , we can only adopt new things relating to the one specific subject we know well about .
For example , say that I did n't focus on any other subject but only on Chemistry .
And I faced new graphs like velocity vs. time .
Even though I can just memorize the characterstics , it will be very confusing to understand why the graphs look like that without knowledges in mathmetics .
Therefore , some knowledge in mathematics would help me in learning chemistry as well .
Thus , broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important .

Second , it will develop us in thinking critically , beyond and above .
If our knowledge is limited in one specific subject , then our brain will work relating only to that specific subject .
For example , say that I learned about European history in the history class .
We are to memorize the facts that happened in each country time by time for internal assessments and tests .
At this point , imagine you also learned a lot about economics in the class .
Now then the events took in each country time by time will appear a lot easier than they were when you did n't know anything about economics .
This is because the historical events are somewhat related to its economic conditions at that time as well .
Like this , broad knowledge of many academic subjects help us think critically , beyond and above .

Lastly , we can have a good conversation with any kind of people in variety of jobs or professions in society .
If I lack of broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it will be hard to understand people of different professions than ours .
Therefore , it can result my bad relationship with other people later on .
For example , say that I 'm professional in economics and I 'm meeting a philosopher for first at a cafe .
Personally , I want to make a good relationship with him .
However , during the talk , whatever he thinks is way too much different than I think that is .
Also , it 's hard to understand him because I do n't know anything about other subjects from economics ; as well as philosophy .
Therefore , I will definitely have a hard time talking to him .
But imagine if any one of us had broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; say the philosopher did , then he would understand me even his thoughts are different from what I think .
Then , we will somehow keep good relationship between each other .
Like this , broad knolwedge of many academic subjects help us in communicating with other people and make social relationships better in the future .

In conclusion , with the facts above , I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It helps us apply them to further learnings , develops our critical thinking skills and gives a chance to make a good social relationship with other people .
