I do not agree with this statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable to students than learning facts .
I do not deny the importance of understanding ideas and concepts , but there are several reasons to students continue to concentrate on learning facts .

First of all , ideas and concepts are theoretical definitions .
Even students can understand study concepts and main ideas , if they cannot apply them to real society , it is useless .
There are so many things possessing gap between concept and fact .
If students concentrate on only understanding ideas and concepts , it is easy for them to study just artificial area .

Can you imagin a class without case study ?
It is impossible .
Even the mathematics textboox has examples of real life .
It is because the importance of the fact .
Students can be motivated from real examples and they can find the reason why they are studying .
Suppose that a student learned government .
He or she do not understand fully what government do and why it is needed in the society .
After he or she accessed numerous articles dealing with goverment , they would percieve importance of government 's role .

It is hard to understanding ideas and concepts without learning facts .
There are so many theories and studies extended for a long time , and people should know how they can apply studies to real life .
Difficult theories and study results usually from the experiment of facts .
People cannot reach the eventual ideas or concepts without learning facts .
Ideas and concepts existing for facts .

Learning facts will provide people motivation of ideas and concepts .
Consequently , it also makes people continue to think about new ideas and concepts .
Through learning facts , people would have question about them and try to solve them , and finally , could achieve genuine results of study .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts without learning facts is not efficient to students .
