Traveling is a major booming industry in modern society .
A myriad number of People travel abroad even though they have to spend a lot of money .
There is a ongoing debate whether people need tour guides when people travel exotic places .
A substancial number of people prefer traveling with tour guides to traveling by themselves .
However contrary to this opinion , I strongly believe that traveling with out a tour guide is better because of more exciting experiences and saving budgets .

First of all , people who visit new places will experience more amazing experience .
People will venture enexpected situations that they have never suspected .
The rationale benind this is that if people follow the tour guide who know all the schedules and places , people wil lose their interests and curiosities .
By exploring new places without any experienced knowledge people will feel the freedoms and excitements .
When I when to Sydney without a tour guide , I could understand that city by exploring myself step-by-step .
Therefore visiting without a tour guide is enjoyable .

On top of that , People who do not travel in a group led by a tour guide save a lot of money .
Tour guide job is high-paying job .
So tourists should be responsible for hiring them .
One of my friend went to Japan for two times , she said that she could save more than 1000 dollars when she went to Japan independently even though she stayed longer .
In this sense , traveling without a tour guide is more recommendable for the people who try to save money .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide .
People can experience more staggering experience and can save funds .
Traveling is really appeling but needs much money .
All in all , people can obtain beneficial profits by traveling themselves .
without a tour guide 's help .
