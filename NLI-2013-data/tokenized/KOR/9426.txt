It is natural that a student studying harder can get higher grade than others .
However , if he dose n't study efficiently , he will not get a result as he expects .
I firmly believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
This is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduced the necessity of learning facts themselves .

To begin with , students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful , For example , most subjects in school require logical thinking rather than memorizing facts .
When I was in high school , I was one of the book worms .
However , my grade was not improved as much as I studied .
At the freshman years , I did n't know the reason but I became to know the reason after I met my freind , James , in the second year .
He always tried to understand the ideas and concepts so that he studied very efficiently and got better grade than me .
On top of that , I think people who can understand ideas and concepts are also love in society because they can solve problems quickly .
To be sucessful students try to understand the ideas and concepts

Secondly , variouse accessible sources on the internet reduced the neccesity of learning facts themselves .
To be specific , in the time when people had difficulties finding information , people depended on their memory a lot .
However , now people can access internet to gather general information as much as they want .
This means people do not need to memorize general things .

In conclusion , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
This is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduced the necessity of learning facts themselves .
