Have you ever dreamed of going back to the past when you could enjoy as much as you wanted ?
The older you are , the less interesting your life might be .
Do you know why a lot of people are eager to be yeonger although our lifetime remarkably went up ?
We are all dreaming of the happiest moment of my lifetime .
Just because you are younger than others , it does n't mean that you enjoy life more than older people do .
Still , I take it for granted that there are more chances for younger people to enjoy life because they have more time to meet friends .
Besides , they do n't have as many experiences as older people do .

Younger people can enjoy something jolly with people whom they like .
Although most of them go to school , there are also so many freinds as well as fellow in the school , whereas it 's extremely difficult for older poeple to gather their pals because each of them has thier job .
They should make money to take care of their beloved family who can be much more important than friends .
On the other hand , younger people can go to the bar , club , concert and their chun 's house .
No matter how much time they have , they can meet their friends whenever they want .

Next , they have less experiences than older people do .
It is one of tremendous advantages .
They can do something that old people regard as something boring because it could be something special and uninitiated for them .
For examples , hard trip is pretty pleasing for them because it 's not only something new , but they can also undergo new and precious expriences .
Personally , I was allowed to go to South-East Asia at first becuase my parents think it can be absolutely hard and dangerous , but it was very attractive and gay for me to go there .
I could go there after I had been allowed to go there in the end .
I have never gone though such fantastic things .
If I had been older and less active , I could n't have undergone .

In conclusion , yeonger people enjoy our lifetime more than older people .
They can do anything they want with their friend , and they can even enjoy something of which older people are already sick .
That 's why I alleged affirm that younger people have more opportunities as well as time to enjoy themselves as far as I 'm concerned
