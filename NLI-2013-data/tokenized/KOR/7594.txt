Today , we go to vacations to various places such as Italy , France , or Switzerland .
When going on a vacation , some people prefer being in a group of tourists led by a tour guide .
However , in my opinion , I believe that the best way of traveling is traveling individually without a tour guide for these two reasons .

First of all , traveling with a tour guide is too limited in time .
For instance , even if you want see something leisurally , you would be cut off on time and have to assemble to a certain place the tour guide wants you to .
You would n't be able to spend lots of time as you want buying postcards in shopping areas or have time watching street performances .
I believe a trip will be more enjoyable when spending time leisurally with your family or friends , so I think getting limited on time is n't a good choice to make .

Also , following the tour guide in your trip will make you feel uncomfortable and also may cause some bad interactions with the tour guide .
For example , if you are tired or want to see some other parts of the country such as beautiful scenaries , or places where a famous movie was taken , you wo n't be allowed to go there because you have to move as a group through out your trip .
Once when I was on a trip to Austria , there was a suggestion of visiting the house in the movie , `` Sound of Music '' by the majority of tourists , but it was not taken by the tour guide .
So that day ended up in having misunderstandings and negative feelings toward the guide .

In conclusion , I think the best way of traveling is traveling without a tour guide , but rather traveling by your own will .
Following the guide all day , weeks , or months will be too limited in time and make you feel uncomfortale .
Therefore , I believe that traveling individually will be more fun and will allow you to have more chances of looking around places and being free .
