People often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new things and tasks rather than doing one things they can do well .

First of all , those who are changing constantly can succeed now .
Some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many things .
However , It is now not available .
Nowadays , everything is so fast and complexed .
So people can easily feel boring at same thing .
For example , as many people know , the rock group ` Radiohead ' is still popular .
They have been singing for more than ten years .
there were many popular rock groups at that time .
Radiohead changed their music style and challenged new things that people have never heard .
If they had stock to their one style of music , they could not have continued their populization .

Furthermore , challenging new things and face new tasks are more exciting and refreshing .
Only doing onething makes people feel boring and lazy .
people who are lazy can not be better than those who are exciting to do something .
suppose that you have to eat hambuger everyday .
Even if the hambugers are delicious , you would be sick of having same food .

Moreover , While people challenge new thing people can learn new skill .
we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well .
Also we need to try many things because , nowadays , we need many skills .
In the past time , the world was not large for people .
It was local society .
However , we can not succeed with only one skilled ability because the world are huge and complicated .
If you know that how to use computers , then you need to try something else .
It will give you new skills and more oppotunity to succeed .

Talking all of things into account , it is sure that successful people tend to challenge new things and face new risks rather that only doing one thing because it is more efficient , refreshing and skillful .
