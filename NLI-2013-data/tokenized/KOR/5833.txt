It may seem to be true that the use of the car will be decreased in some time .
However , it does not seem to be right even in this moment .
Moreover , I strongly belive that people will take more cars in the future .

First , there are possibilities that the rate of using cars will be decreasing .
Nowadays , the enviroment problem such as air pollution have become one of the most significant problem in our lives .
Where have such an pollution come from ?
In general people mostly find the solution of the question from the largely increased use of artifacts , especially cars .
Therefore most governments considerably raise tuition for using a car or at least have plan to gradully increase it for reducing air pollution .
Besides such raised tuition , the restrictions using the car will be highly increasing as the concern of the environment increases .
Also , the fee for using cars will be larger since the amount of petrolium is significantly decreasingn .
Therefore , people might buy less cars to reduce such disadvantages .

However , although such assertion is valid in today , number of people both who uses a car and wants to use a car is not decreased , rather than reduced .
For example , according to chosunilbo , one of the most believable and popular journalism in Korea , the rate of population using car has been even increased for ten years , and expertises also assert that this rate will not be decreased .
How can it happen in spite of such a burden ?

People are willing to have cars in several reasons above all such disadvantages such as high fees or tuition .
First , cars are so convenient that people do not want to give up the car .
It is clearly more rapid and free than bus or train .
Especially , moving in cars in such a huge country like United States is even necessary for almost all people .
Second , the car has become the symbol of wealth rather than just one of the most useful artifacts nowadays .
More than sixty percent of people in the Korea has their own cars , such that having a car becomes to be so normal .
Therefore the people eventually compare their cars so that there borns some rules rather than just tendency that the more welthy , the better car the people have becomes .
Such rules will continue in several years .
Therefore I strongly belive that there will be more cars in use than there are today .
