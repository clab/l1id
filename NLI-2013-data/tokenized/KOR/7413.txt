Many people prefer to travel with groups with tour guides , but I totally do not agree with this way of travel .
There are number of disadvantages if someone choose to make a group tour with guides .
Such as lack of flexibility of the schedule , loosing the oppotunities to meet new friends and inconvinience caused by the large group .

First of all , the schedule is not flexible for the guided group tours .
Let us assume that you are on a trip .
If you are in the group , all you can do is just folloing the guide and listen to him/her .
On the other hand , if you make your own trip , you can go to anywhere you want and whenever you want .
If you feel tired from hiking yesterday , you can sleep a couple of more hours if you want .

The second reason that I do not prefer the group tour is that I do not want to loose the oppotunity to get close to native people .
The hilight of a trip can be making new friends from all over the world .
I simply cannot afford to loose the chance to make a conversation , exchange political opinions and so on .

Finally , if you are in a group , it takes much more time to move to another place .
For example , if you are waiting in the line in the airport , you have to still wait for your company even though you are finished with your process .
However , if you are alone or with a small group , you do not have to waste your time to wait for the people whom you really do not know .

In my opinion , true travel has to made up by travelers themselves so that they can experience more and feel more .
The most important thing you can get from a travel is how much you felt and experienced , not how many places you have been or see .
