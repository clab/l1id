People have different opinions on whether having general knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
people who diagree the statment argue that specific knowlege is useful to get a better jobs .
However , I agree the topic for two reasons : capability and social relationship .
I will explain these reasons in detail .

To begin with , broad knowledge is capability which has one of the facters in modern society .
Nowadays society wants people who have diverse ability .
Also , many university offers various curriculum to students .
For example , my sister has many ability such as English ability and resources of economy , policy and art .
So when she meet people , almost all people like my sister .
In one day , she went to bankd to exchage his dollar .
Hence , she saw some foreigner .
So she asked some thing to happen and the man answerd that he did not find their company , Therefore , she talked him and solved the problem , After that , she got some request to get a job .
This means that ability is useful for living society .

Second , it is good for sustaining social relationship .
People want to make relationship with brilliant person .
Moreover , they need to obtain to get good qualification .
Besides , many private institute to learn creat in our society .
Among them , the language courses as an good example .
In my University , Kookmin University , has many courses for language such as chinese , Japanes and English .
Consequetly , many people concentrate on the courese .
Therefore , the courses is finished to enroll .
Also , my uninversity offers conversation courese to students .
It means that it is useful for student .

In conclusion , I support that information of many academic subject is better than professional subject for the following reasons .
First , it is ability which modern people should have .
Second , it is eligible for keeping social relationship .
