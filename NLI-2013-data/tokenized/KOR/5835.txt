It has been said that , ` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ' .
It could be true since the fuel that we use now to run cars are running out , but however I disagree with the statement and I will present briefly why I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First reason is that population is growing rapidly , and people are live longer nowadays .
More people means more cars , people wants convinience in their life more than anything else , people growth are growing since we have revolutionized industrial and medical care , medical care we have increased our estimate lives .
As I mentioned more people are being born and live longer they 're going to be willing to use more cars .

Second reason , and the problem I 've mentioned about fuel , the fuel we now use is ` gasoline ' and I know that it 's limited and some scientists said that it 'll run out quicker than we think , but that is just like saying that we wo n't be finding the replacement , we 've revolutionalize in many ways and we 've been making new technology to make our lives better , just couple hundred years ago gasoline was a junk but now it 's a most important thing in our lives , just like we 've found gasoline we 're going to find something else just as important and capable as gasolines did .

In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and It could be true since the fuel that we use now to run cars are running out , but I totally disagree with this statement because our human being have developted more and more and we 're going to develop our lives even faster since popluation is growing , and soon we 'll find a perfect replacement for the fuel we use to run cars .
