I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons that I agree with it are that they can change the color of products to look better and they hide the bad points of their products .

First , when the companies advertise their products , they always monitoring and editing the advertisements to make them nice .
They also design the advertisements so that the products colors and shapes look better .
However , if we see the goods in stores without fancy effects , they are less attractive than in advertisement .
For example , in i-pod advertisement , they use fancy colors to make it cool , but it is just computer graphic .

Second , the companies know that what are the bad points of their products , so they hide it .
In television , we ca n't figure out if they do n't show to us .
We can do to the store and figure out that what is error of the products but still we can miss it .
For example , some food restaurants put some chemical material , but they do n't tell the people that they put bad portions in foods .
They always say these are chuicy and jucy , not fatty or harmful .

Thus , many companies make their goods look great to make money .
They want to hire the person like as advertisements designer in order to make their products fancy .
They also want creative person to create new strateges of their business .
We know that they want to make money , so we must think and choose carefully when we buy our products .
