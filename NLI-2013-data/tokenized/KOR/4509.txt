I strongly agree with the statement , `` most advsetisements make products seem much better than thery really are '' for two reasons : the purpose of advertisements to sell products and the great influence of mass media .
In order to understand this trend , it is essential to deal with the producers and receivers of the messages and the channel which conveys the messages from the producers to the receivers .

First of all , it is important to take a close look at the producers and receivers of the messages .
For the advertisers , the main purpose of the advertisements is to sell products .
In order to appeal to potential customers , it seems essential for them to make products look better than actually they are .
In modern societies , beauty is the principal quality that consumers pursue .
Consumers buy products to represent their identities .
They buy fancy cars and clothes because the products represents their values .
In order to appeal the consumers ' desire , advertisers often exaggerate the quality of products .

Also , in order to understand the trend , the external social force should be considered .
Recent years have witness that mass media have a great influence on consumer behaviors .
our societes become more and more commercial .
mass media reinforce this trend .
For mass media , advertisements are the main sourse in which they make a profit .
As an organization which try to make a greater profit , mass media solicit advertisers and allure them providing fancier technologies than before .
Mass media use special equipments that were not available in the past .

In conclusion , considering the the desire of advertisers and consumers and the irresistible influence of mass media nowadays .
I strongly believe that most advertisements make products look much better .
