I agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
First , travel in a group led by a tour guide is convenient .
Second , it is less expensive than travel alone .
Last , it is more secure than travel without a tour guide .

First , a tour guide makes people , who do not have experience or infromation of trip , feel convineint .
When most of people take a trip , they do not spend time for studying for the trip .
They want to take a rest during the trip .
A tour guide , who professionally knows information of counties and lacotaion make people not put pressure on unfamiliar condition of foreign countries .

Second , grouping people for trip by a tour guide is cheaper than traveling alone .
A tour guide offers cheap method of travel to people .
By grouping people , they can get an opportunities of discout cost of hotels , food , and entertainment .
A tour guide already prepares the discout information in order to offer cheap travel and high quality of it .

Last , a tour guide guarantees the security for people .
As a tour guide leads people to secure places , they avoid of unknown risks in foreign countries .
And individual is more exposured than a group .

In conclusion , there are a lot of reasons that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Convinience , cheap cost , and security of travel are prominently considered by the majority who want to take a trip .
