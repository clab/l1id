There has been many controversies going on regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I strongly believe that a person should have broad knowledge of various academic subjects rather than specialized knowledge .

First of all , having broad knowledge allows an individual to become `` better '' than a person who specialized in one specific subject .
What I mean by better is that the person will have more opportunity to get a good job and have a better life , because after all , what a company and the society look for in a person is how round an individual is .
The broader a person 's knowledge is , the more an individual is considered rounded .
For example , my father who is a CEO of his own company once said that a company looks for a person who is rounded rather than a perosn who is good in one specific area .
When he chooses new workers for his company , he always sees if a person has broad knowledge or not .
His rationale behind this is that if a person is more rounded , then the individual will be able to work in many different areas , which brings up the efficiency of the company as a whole .

Not only that , but a rounded person is usually more experienced with various things .
Rounded person has vast knowledge which reflects that the individual must have had experienced many aspects of life .
However , if a person is specialized in one detailed subject , then it reflects that a person has narrow mind and is less experienced than the rounded person is .
For example , a friend of mine who has broad knowledge is more familiar with all the different kinds of events happening .
However , another friend of mine who is specialized in one speicific subject is narrow minded and unfamiliar with subjects that he did not specialize .
Thus , the extent of the knowledge portray 's a person 's experience in life .

Lastly , a person who has broad knowledge is more opened minded than the specialized person is .
A good example is my mother who has endless knowledge about everything .
Everytime I talk to her , I realize that she is very liberal and is open minded .
However , my father who specialized in Chinese culture in University , has a very conservative and closed mind about all the events because he simply does not have broad experiences .
I personally think being opened and liberal is crucial in current society , because the new generations of people are generally welcoming changes and are opened as well , and in these days it is important to fit in the society in order to survive .

To summarize , I advocate the point that a person should have broad knowledge of many different academic subjects .
A Korean proverb states `` Digging one well is hard , but digging many different well with same depth as that of digging one well is harder , '' which means , an individual should challenge oneself by digging various wells , also meaning that a person should have broadd knowledge of many different subjects .
