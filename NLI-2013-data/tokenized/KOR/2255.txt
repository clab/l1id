People ofthen says that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
It is evident that older people often regrets their life and they want repeat their young ages .
So , in my opinion , older people could not enjoy their life because their energy or enthusiasm is frustrated and they have a large burdens .

It is widely accepted that younger people have more energy than older people .
From my experience , my grandfather was an athletes .
He always energitic and proud of his accomplishment .
In addition , he enjoys active hobbies , such as hiking .
Doing hike , my grandfather could enjoy his life and have the sense of accivement .
However , after he resigned , although he could have much times to enjoy lifemore than ever , he could n't hike which demands much energy .
He always complains his health problems and weakness .
Sometime , he says that I should do everything I want , when I am still younger .

On top of that , younger people have less responsibility .
As persons ages , there are more responcibles that they have to , such as marriages , working , raising , etc .
To be specific , my older brother who maraged man with two beautiful babies .
He is always busy because he shoud earn much money for their family .
Unfortunately , he never rests his weekends .
When I told my travel plan that took two months , he envies me , since he could not that .
I do n't have to worry about practical things , I can enjoy my life than my older brother .

To summary , I strongly believe that younger people have more enjoyment than older people do .
Of course , I concede that older people could have more meaningful life because their experiences and wisdoms .
However , It is certain that younger people could attempt many things because of their energy , also , they could enjoy life since they have less responcibility .
