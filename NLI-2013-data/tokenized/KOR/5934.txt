It is often said that percent of using cars will be decreased with in twenty years than now .
Some people might agree with this statement because they think that there will be new transfortation which will replace cars .
However , I firmly believe that using car population will go up in the near future .
This is because there are more people who want to buy a car due to develop economy and the tecnology of transper combience such as road will also develop .

First of all , as far as I am concerned , a large number of people want to buy car because of breaktrough of economy .
In other words , there will be more people who afford to pay buying car .
It is commonly observed that economy became go up as time goes by .
For example , in the past , there are a few people who can buy car because it is extreamly expensive to buy .
However , as econmy have developed , many people can have atomobile .
This is because , the cost of cars have been decreased and people richer relatively than before .
Therefore , I think that people who will have car will be increase .

In addition , tecnology of transpertation infra will also develop with in twenty years .
What I am trying to say is that it will be helful to people who want to use car .
For instance , many infra 's development such as high ways and local roads and solving the problems such as car accidents will give benefit to a great number of divers .
So , from my persective , People who usually used other transfertation due to these problems will use more cars .
Finally , car drivers will soar .

In conclusion , there are two main reasons why I think that using car population will incrase .
It is not only because there will exist more rich people who can buy car owing to economy boom , but also technology which related wiht car industry will develop .
