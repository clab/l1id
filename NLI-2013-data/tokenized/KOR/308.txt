Assume that an apple suddenly falls on someone 's head .
What would that person say out right away ?
If it were me , i would say ` ouch ! ' but Newton said ` why did it fall ? '
Here is a significant differences between him and other people .
Newton wondered why the apple falls to the ground , not floating on the air , while everyone had already accepted it as a natural incident .
As soon as he became curious and wondering , he started studying on it .
That is what most scientist or inventors usually start their scientifical work .

Look at King .
Martin Luther .
He is very well-known black person who had been arguing about black people 's freedom and right .
He must have had suffered a lot of risks while he was arguing his opinion .
Not that he was the only one who was upset about white people 's unfairness .
Black people were also as upset as him , but none of them were as brave as him .
He is now very famous , historical , heorical person in the history of the world .

Lastly , soldiers in all kinds of wars .
Many people took the risks to die in the war , get tortured by enemy , and lose their family .
They surely and obviously knew how much risky way they chose to follow .
But they did not deny it .
They followed it as if it was what they must have done .

Historical , famous , well-know , and greatly successful people take risks as if that is what they were born to do .
They think differently .
They are always willing to try and do new things rather than following what other people have thought or believed in .
