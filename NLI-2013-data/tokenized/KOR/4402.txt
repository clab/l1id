I agree that most advertisements make goods seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are important .
However , the davertisement can be make products useless because people is able to misunderstand on advertisement .

First , most advertisement purpose to sell the products .
so , many company always think about customer and customing how much goods can be sole out to a lot of people .
For example , if people or consumer are watching advertisements on TV or magazine , people feel attracting the product because purpose ofcompany owner or advertisements owner sell much better than they relly making a lot of products .
Morover , if a lot of people do n't watching advertisement on TV or magazine , many people do not buy products .

Second , most advertisement make to competition many people .
For instance , if someone buy a car , someone say other people or other people ask for someone where the car is buying .
Sometimes , Buyer told other people that i wish to buy a car because i watching Tv .
He will proud his car because advertisement said about car is wonderful .

conclusiony , i agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they .
