I disagree with the statement that says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
There are several reasons why I disagree .

The first reason is that if students only learned the facts than they would not be as creative as the other students who actually understand ideas and concepts .
People have the ability to think so that if they just learned the facts they might memorized the facts and not understanding .
For example , I have experienced that situation .
I studied for my test and not understanding but memorizing all the facts .
So i could not think of anything outside of the box .
i failed that test from that now I usually try to understand ideas and concepts .

The second reason is that if you understand ideas and concepts you will eventually get the facts too .
Like i kind of said at the first paragraph , understanding helps you study more .
It stays in your head longer and you will not forget easily .
On the other hand , learning facts , you will forget easily because you just memorized it and did not understand .

The third reason is that understanding ideas and concepts are the basic steps .
If you want to use anything you have to understand ideas and concepts first .
For example , if you want to use a computer you have to understand ideas and concepts of how to use it , like reading the direction .
It is not just learning the facts .

To sum up , I do not agree with the statement .
I seriously think that the more important for students are to understand ideas and concepts and not just learn facts .
I think that learning facts would help students for at the moment but not for the long run .
