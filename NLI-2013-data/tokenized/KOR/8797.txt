In general , people have different learning method .
For example , some student tend to memorize the facts without understading the ideas and concepts to keep it simple .

For example , when I took my math exam , I could not remember the formula .
I tried to think of the process how the formula came from and finally I could make the formula which was exactly the same as I looked for .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts help to identify the facts .
