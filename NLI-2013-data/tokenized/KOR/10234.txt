People , especially common people , often discuss whether it is necessary to try new things and take risks rather than only doning what they already know how to do well .
But I strongly believe that succssful people try to new things and undergo risks .
If it were not for taking harships and trying new things , they have no opportunit to win other competitiors .

Successful people generally more bold and painstaking than those who do not .
As everyone know , this is not the only way of succeeding in doing , but this is one of the most effecitive way of succeding .
In addition , it can positively contribute to find new ones that gives people a lot of confidence .
Let 's say that a scientist try to reasearch new things , if he is just the man who just mix other theories that already every people knows .
He would never be successful in his filed .
If he tried to find new things and take harship , he would succeed .

Successful people also think different way in every time .
I understand that too much attention paid to new things is negative becasuse it may cause much more cost to do and sweep memebers along , sometimes to the detriment of their original work .
But the advantages of tinking creatively eclipse the disadvantages .
For example , people who always think different for winning in the market econnomy can find the fraction between many products .
So he can beat other competitiors .
As everyone knows people cannot work to its best ability when there is not new one that enable company to be vigorous as well as company to win in economy .

Taking all of things into account , there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to successful people or to win in some fields , you should be not doing what you know how to do well but doing more courageable , painstaking and creative .
