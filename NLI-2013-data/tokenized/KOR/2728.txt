Every people has their own lives , they can enjoy the life , or suffer their lives .
As the topic says , `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , that is wrong .
I disagree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I think old people are enjoying life in their ways .
As most people know they are not healthy as younger people so we can think they are not enjoying life .
Enjoying life does n't mean people have to move .
They can read books , listen the music , or drink tea .
It depends on the personality of the person .
Also on the television shows how they think about old people .

First , old people like to talk , it does n't matter who is it .
In the book , Tuesdays with Morrie , Morrie wants to talk to somebody , he just want someone to listen to his story .
So the person who listens to his story is Mitch Albom , he was Morrie 's student once .
Like i said , people think old people are not enjoying their lives because they are not moving , but they are enjoying the life that they have .
Old people are enjoying in their way to find happiness .
Young people are healthy so they can go where ever they want and get everything they want .
But because they are doing what they want , they ca n't be happy .
The real happiness is inside of our mind .

Second , the happiness of enjoy life can be changed by the person 's personality .
For example , one of my friend does n't like to hang out with her friends or does n't like to talk to someone .
But she is enjoying her life in her own way .
I have no idea what does she do when she go home , may be she reads book , may be she collects pictures , or may be listens to the music .
Enjoying life is not like someone says , `` She does n't know how to play so she 's not enjoying her life .
She is suffering her life '' , it does n't mean she is really suffering her life , she is enjoying her life by doing her favorite activities .

Third , yesterday I watched tv show `` Los Angles '' , they had episode of old ladies in the swimming pool .
People can go in the pool with topless , so those old ladies swam without top .
So the worker at the hotel made them go out the pool .
Many people think old people are ruining their lives , but not really .
They are enjoying their lives just like yound people do .

Therefore , everyone has their way to live their lives , to enjoy their lives .
For many reasons , they are enjoying the life as same as yound people do .
I hope prople in the world do n't have fence to the old people , because everybody 's getting old , and we will be the old people one day .
