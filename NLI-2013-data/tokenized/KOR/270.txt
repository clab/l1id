I agree with the statement that students have to get the ideas and concepts than just learning facts .
The learning will be more effective , improves their brain work , and the lifestyle can change posetive .

First , the learning would be more efficient .
Students have to think and understand to get the ideas and concepts .
And this process makes them think why the facts happen and gives them a purpose to learn .
In consquence , they will apply that on every learning .
For example , in science class , there are many kind of principles students need to understand , and thinking why this principle happen will make the student curious .
That way leads the student more participate in class and has fun in learning .
It will be much better for the student to think by himself ( herself ) rather than just being taught the fact and try to remember .

Also , it will improve their brain working by understand the concepts .
They learn how to think logically and from that they get good grades at objects like math , science , physics , and so on .
Not only the school grades but also the brain work will improve and the student could be more intelligent .
For instance , the one who have always thought about the ideas and the concepts and the one who has n't have a big difference in the quality of knowledge .

Finally , students lifestyle can change .
They can get more posetive then they were .
Thinking logically or hard definitely creates a good mind .
And those who do can easily get calm down and get relaxed .
Especially when they get angry , they can get stop arguing and start to think about solving the problem .

Therefore , I agree that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
It makes the learning more effective , improves their brain , creates a posetive mind .
For these reasons I agree with the statement .
