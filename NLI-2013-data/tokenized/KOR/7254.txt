Is the best way to travel is going on a trip in a group led by a tour guide ?
If you are asking my opinion , my answer would be No .
I have experienced both travelling by myself and travelling with a tour guide , and , now , I will give you a couple of reasons why you should travel alone .

First of all , when you travel by yourself , you will have all the freedom in the world during your travel .
I am not talking about walking down the streets by yourself kind of freedom , what I am talking about is freedom to choose what to do , where to go , and what to eat , see , or experience .
I am sure the tour guide will provide you an excellent tour course for you to enjoy with your group .
However , tour course will be just that , the tour course .
Hundreds , or maybe thousands of people may have already been to those places .
Is that what you want ?
Enjoying an experience that the rest of the world already know ?
If I were you , I would love to go some places that no one has gone before , or the places that the locals enjoy , not the tourists enjoy .
Maybe , you will be able to find and make a local friend while you are enjoying a meal that are popular amongst locals .
Would that be possible if you were a member of a group who are follwoing the tail of the tour guide ?

Also , how can you guarantee that you will be a member of a group consist of only nice and charming guys and girls ?
You will be stuck with these people for a week or even for a month , what if some of them are just unpleasant people ?
Let 's say you are sharing a room with one of your group members , what if he snores like thunder ?
I am pretty sure that is not going to be a pleasant travelling moment .
If you travel alone , you wo n't have to worry about any of that .
Yes , you might feel lonely , you might need someone to depend on during your travel , but is n't that what the travel is all about ?
If you did not want to feel lonely and be supported by your friends , you could have just stayed at your home !

People always look for easier and more comfortable ways to travel .
I agree that group tour maybe less demanding and easier way to travel new places .
However , think about what you actually want to acquire during your travel .
Is it few fancy pictures of you with nice looking backgrounds ?
Or , is it once in a lifetime experience that you will remember for the rest of your life ?
If it is the later that you want , you need to travel by yourself , and experience it for yourself .
