In nowadays , the rate of increasing cars is faster than ever before .
It is true that car has many benefits for moving from place to another place .
However , I strongly agree that there will be less cars than now in twenty years because of following reasons .

First of all , a car is a main cause of many pollution problems .
By using of gasoline to drive a car , car makes much CO or other kinds of harmful gases which provokes air pollution .
These pollutions have been accumulated for many years so that nature disastors which we cannot explain scientifically occurs recently .
According to a survey which is investigated all over the world by green peace , which is one of the famous environmental organizations , over 80 % people of who suffered from the nature disasters believe that substances which are made by car has been made disasters .
Moreover , the goverment is making laws about the limiting of using a car because of the pollution .

Another significant reason is that the amount of oil which is a very popular resource to drive a car is decreasing .
As everybody know , the amount of oil which is saved under the ground is limited and its price is increasing fastly .
According to a geological professor in the United States , the rest of oil will finish only for 12 years if we use oils in the same rate as now .
As more expensive the price of oil is , less people drive a car .
For example in my country , when the oil prices was going up 10 % of the price , 20 % of the drivers gave up to drive a car .
Although there are other sources such as electricity or hybrid , howere , it needs time more than 20 years to be common .

To make a long story short , the population of driving a car will be decresing in a few years because of pollution and expensive oil .
Therefore , there will be fewer cars in use than today .
