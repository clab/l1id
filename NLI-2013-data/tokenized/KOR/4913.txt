I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , an advertisement is in the between reality and imagine .
For example , if some medicine company advertise made by rabbit blood by showing the ingrediants and the real processing methods , nobody do n't want to buy or sell .
I know this example seems like over-expression ; however , let think about reality , it totally depend on mild imagine .
The mild imagine is cute and humorous .
The second reason that I agree the topic is that .
The main objective of advertisement is to persuasive buyers or costomers .
It is the most important to advertise .
At this point , to get agreement some product become more beautiful and gorgerous using new high technology such as potograpic technic , various grapic technic with computor .
So the development technology is creasing to stimulate customer 's view .
As a results , many company use the effect and then the results make it to be see most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
