We live in the world that features highly developed technology , fast life style , and widely spread network of Internet .
I firmly believe this phenomenon are forced to have an influence on our life continueously .
In this reason , I predict that there will be fewer cars in the future .

First of all , the development of Internet will be responsible for declinge in the number of cars .
We do not need to move one place to another in order to meet our friends , get some information neccessary for out work , read the paper that shows what happens today .
All we have to do is click search bar or surf the internet .
It 'll probably be led to the reduction in movment using transportation system , especially riding a car for the period of time .

On the other hand , we cannot miss the possibility to meet new type of transportation method .
For a long time , we have depend on the car that is very comfortable and familiar with us .
However , riding a car has weaknesses at many espects .
As many highways are crowded with many cars , they cause a lot of problems .
For examples , it can pollute the air we breathe every day and many unexpected accidents , which , to some extent , make us injured and dangered .
Because it has many unconveniences for us , advanced technology is going to help us to live happily without worrying about environmental elements or accidents .

In short , I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Internet will make us deal with almost every our work at home and the alternative to the cars will apprear .
In the hope of new transportation system , we can concentrate on our present work .
