Some people said a tour guide is needed , when you travel the new country or unfamilier place , but I have a different opinion .
I think a tour guide could not be good for travel always .
There are some reasons to support my opinion .

First , every people has different preference to have fun with new place or travel .
Some people might want to spend more time at art gallery , and the others want to go to beachs or shores which are famous through out the world , but if we have to follow the guide .
we do n't have chance to spend more time , where we want to stay more .

Second , the cost to hire any tour guide is not cheaper .
Whenever we thought about the travel or trip , biggest problem or issue is the buget which might affect the decision whether we can go a travel or not .
Futhermore , we could stay more days with extra money that came from the cost to hire tour guide .

Third , if we do not hire any tour guide , we must research infomation about the place where we plan to travel .
After researching infomation of the place , we may gain more knowledge of the place .
and it can make us enjoy the travel with knowledge , result of our effort of research .

Many people have different opinion about the travel and trip , but the most important thing for plan to go to new place is what kind of things we could learn from the travel .
We need to do it ourselves .
