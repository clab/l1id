The producers use advertisements to introduce the products to the consumers .
The income of company depends on how much it sells its product by appealing effecitvely to the audience through advertisements .
Also , certain company might be in a competition with another company , thus it would wish to make a better advertisement to sell more products .
Because of these competitive natures of advertisement , the producers often make products seem much better than they actually are .

A company 's main goal is to sell as much product as possible to grow economically .
In order to sell a great number of products , a company first has to appeal to the consumers .
By making advertisements that make products look much better than the actual product , a company can encourage the audience to at least come and look at their product .
Even though the consumer may not buy the product , he or she will know about it since it appealed to them effectively through the advertisement .
If the advertisement did not make the product look that great , the consumer would not even consider to come and see it .
For example , an advertisement of a new car or a computer demonstrates that the product guarantees the consumer 's satisfaction .
However , any human made product is bound to have mistakes and some errors .
When the consumer purchaes this newly advertised computer , he or she will soon discover some malfunctions which is not what the advertisement suggested .
Because the company made such an appealing advertisement , it was able to sell its product , which was their primary goal .

Another reason the company uses advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is the competition with other companies .
The competition causes the producer to want to discourage the consumers to buy the other company 's products and only buy the product of his or hers .
In order to cause this discouragement is to make an effective advertisement .
To win the competition , an exaggeration of its product will not be the company 's main concern .
Thus , the company will willingly make its product look much better in its advertisement than it actually is .

The advertisements are the main means of communication betweenthe producers and the consumers .
To sell more products and to survive in the competition with other companies , a certain company will not hesistate to make product seem much superior to the actual product .
