Trying new things have many advantages but it has also lots of negative effects .
I disagree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because of the reasons that it is wasting time , often dangerous .

Even though people can gain new experiences through trying new experiences , it is wasting time .
Keep working on something they already know how to do well is the way to be successful and saving time .
If people try new things , they always start and learn all things over again and again .
Nevertheless , they can discover and get to know more deeply if they keep doing what they are familiar about .
For example , me and my friend started to play flute when we were in third grade .
I am still learning it but my friend decided to play another instrument next year .
Now , she forgot how to play flute at all and she wants to play it again .
Then she have to go over it all again and forget about the one that she was learning before .
Thus , trying new things is wasting time .

It always can be dangerous to try new things .
Because they do n't really know and not skilled about it .
About 3 years ago , I decide to learn snow bording since I only know how to ride ski .
I thought that ski and snow bording would be similar but it was n't .
I was really confident before I fell down several times and hurt myself so badly .
In addition , people can fall into things negatively like addicting because at first , they are not sure what it is and just start it .
Therefore , trying new things can give risks .

I would rather keep improving things I am good and skilled at than trying a variety of experiences because it is wasting time and could harm myself .
Safe is always first .
Doing what they already know how to do well is the way to be successful .
