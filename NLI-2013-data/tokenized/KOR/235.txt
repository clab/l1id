Travelling is one of the most popular pastimes .
Most people are usually plan to travel across the country or overseas in their own life .
They enjoy talking about diverse experiences where each person traveled .
From my experience , I agrees with the travel in a group led by a tour guide with some economical and exciting reasons .

Firstly , I like to travel in group led by a tour guide bacause I can save more money and time .
A tour guide is professional enough to give us more infomation fitted to places what we want to travel .
In addition , a tour guide needs to compete other agencies , and it try to give more benefits for its clients .
A tour guide also has a lot of experienced information about what I want to travel , so it is kind to consult to give information .

The more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with a several of people for themselves .
We can have chance to socialieze a lot of new people .
If we travel around unfamiliar places alone , it is difficult to first talk about unfamiliar people .
So it can be alone .
However , traveling in group first it is easy to talke about each other .

To sum up , I recommend the travel in a group led by a tour guide in terms of economial and pleasing points .
