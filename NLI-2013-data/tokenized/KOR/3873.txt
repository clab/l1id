There are several views which is related to this topic .
Some may think that there is no helping from young people for their communities .
However , I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Nowadays , there are a lot of social problems in the world .
These problems have to solve by citizens .
However , if it ca n't solve at the first generation , the new generation , young people is needed .

Therefore , we can easily observed from the cases that most of university student is participating for their society .
They sometimes resist about unfair politics or not good enough international plans .

For these case , we can realize that how they are really interested in thier society and try to help thier communities .

Furthermore , all societies are educating young people .
This education makes student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up .
So we can not determine that they are not helping their communities .
Because studying is the basic resource which makes educated people to think about social problems and to find the way to solve some problems .
For a real , educated people usually participate their sociey .

Finally , the school has a resposible for educating people without any limitations except ages .
They educate not only academic resources but also the importance about helpful behaves to poor people .
We can easily notice from activities in school like go to orphanage and help orphans .
Of course , it is involved in the scores and most school requires the record of working for poor people .

Young people are educated efficiently for help their communities .
When they educated , they naturally have an attitudes to think about social problems as well as the student who did not study hard .
Also young people is the main resources which will manage and control the world .
Thus , it is not appropriate argument that young people is not helping thier communities .
