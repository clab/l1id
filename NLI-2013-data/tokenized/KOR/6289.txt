It is debatable whether the number of cars will be fewere in tewnty years or not .
Some peaple says that the numers will decrease because alternative transportation will be popular in the future .
However , I firmly believe that car 's occupation will increase because of the lack of technologes and economic growth .

Fistly , the technologes to make other good transportations are not developted yet .
Althought mordern technologe is developed in higher point , it is hard to make more economical and popular transportations than car in twenty years .
In the future , other transportaions such as sky-train will apper , but not in twenty year .

Besides , economics are growing consistently to the extent to support non-wealthy people , These will make most peaple afford to and maintain their cars .
It is similar result of computer occupation .
Ten tyears before , there were low rates of having computers .
However , now , almost every house has one or more cuputers .
According a research by Administration of Transportaion of Korea , the number of cars in Korea has been increase by 400 percentage in the past twenty years .
This shows that the car occupations will enhance .

In conclusion , the car will be main trasportaion after twenty year because the technology is not enough developted to make other trasportation and growth of economic will make the numer of car increase .
