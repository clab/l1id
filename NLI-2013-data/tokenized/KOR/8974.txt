In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn facts .
Just learning facts could bring few problems to students .
First , if students just learn about the facts of any topics , they might forget them very easily , some students might not forget , because not every body has same style .
However , if they do n't understatnd ideas or concepts , they will forget when they do n't study facts for a while and try to study again .
It is why understanding ideas is important , if they understand ideas and concepts , they wo n't forget them easily .

Second , it is very hard to learn facts without understanding ideas or concepts .
Especially , for young students like elementray to middle school , they need to understand ideas before they learn facts , because most of thing they learn in school for example are the stuffs that they never heard about .
Therefore , if they just learn facts and not understanding ideas and concepts , they will get hard time in later like high school or college , even they still remember the facts .

Third , they cannot discuss about the thing that they learned , if they only know about the facts , because they would n't know what they should discuss about , for example , students learn about the facts of soda , they ca n't discuss what are the pros of soda and what are the cons of soda .
They only know that what is the soda .

To get better knolwedge , those are the why they should understand ideas and concepts of the topic they learn .
However , I would like to say the facts are very important too to know things , because students could know specificaly about the thing they learn with facts .
Therefore , My opinion is understand ideas and concepts are more important and the first thing to get before learn the facts .
