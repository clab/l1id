I disagree with the statement , because I still can see the young people helping their communities whenever they have time .

It is very common that young people nowadays having hard time doing thier tasks , such as , for thier job , school an so on .
However , some of the young people , whenever they fave thier free time , they prefer to help thier communities , for exemples , teaching thier own languages to youngers and help to build and paint a house .

These young people gather up and help old people to build their houses and paint their walls .
Although they are already tired by thier weekdays ' schedule , they attend on thier helping day and give hope to the old people .

In South Korea , there are many communities that young people are involved .
Since they are meant to be `` The International '' , they go to the countries which they would like to help and work there as long as they want .
Especially , they would like to go to the developing countries and stay there about a month .
Since my uncle was one of the person who helped his community , I heard that he help the community to plan for the trip to Ghanna and so on .

I think there are also some young people who do not put enough time to help thier communities .
However , it is wrong to say most of them are not helping because there are also many young people who are working hard for their communities and whenever they have time , they always think about how they will make their communities better .
As the world gets better in developments young people will be more busy than they were before but on the other hand , I am sure that there will be also many young people who are willing to help their communities whenever they have spare time .
