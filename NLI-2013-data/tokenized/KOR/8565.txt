The textbooks in which the students study with are listed with facts .
Most of them cannot be taught by the students themselves without full understanding of the content .
By this fact , other examples and personal experiences , I have been convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Our current society requires students to use their knowledge effectively later in their life .
By just learning facts , they cannot understand the basic concept and idea to make their knowledge useful .
Our current society is advancing rapidly to fit our needs and wants .
In order to keep the advancement , the students need to understand the concepts rather than facts .
If , for example , a student learns only the fact that one plus one equals to two , and two times four is equal to eight , the student will only learn the answer of that problem without any progress .
The society works the same .
Students must learn the major concepts and ideas in order to progress later in life .

Another reason is from my personal experience .
While I was studying the political science , I could only memorize the facts and could not understand the concepts .
In the test that occurred a day later , I could only answer the questions which were exactly same as the sentences stated in the textbook .
I requested the professor for a retake .
When I asked my father , who has a job involving politics , he gave me the basic concepts of politics and how it worked .
Consequently , I was abled to get a perfect score in the same subject the next day .

Only with the knowledge of the concept rather than facts can one to put it in various solutions to methods .
By just learning the facts , one can only earn one fact .
By learning the ideas and concepts , however , one can use it into various methods and eventually aquire numerous facts .
Therefore , I beleive it is crucial for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than facts .
