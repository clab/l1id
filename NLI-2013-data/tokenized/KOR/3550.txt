Young people nowadays tend to play more than to work for their communities in almost developing nations like South Korea , because they live under their parents ' roof .
I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
Firstly , they have to spend a lot of time studying , and secondly , are more irresponsible than before .

First of all , in universities or colleges , the period of professional course require more time .
For example , in order to be a doctor , you have to spend four years in univiersity , another four years in graduate school , and last two years for a degree .
For men who have to go to army in certain country like in South Korea , men take a lot of time to be a fully finished doctor .
Because the required time had increased , young people can not help their communities until they finish their education .

Furthermore , young people these days are more irresponsible than before .
I do not have rights to say that young people are not responsible because I am still in middle school .
However , I can still see many problems resulting among the young people .
They tend to play more than work or study their professions , and that is the reason why there is so many un-employed college students .
My cousin sister said to me , for example , that majority of students in universities play around on weekends , when they can use that time doing useful things , such as community service program .
Because they just tend to play around , they do not get to be helping with their communities .

For these reasons , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
However , I do not mean that it is their entire fault , yet they have to fix their behavior to play instead of to study or to help their communities .
Because of the requirement of men going to army , men have to sacrifise their preciouse time of youth .
I think that the South Korean and other countries that requires to force men in to armies have to make the policy voluntary instead of involuntary .
Then , I think the young people will give enough time to help their communities .
Thus , I think it would involve a lot of changes to let the young people to give enough time to help their communities .
