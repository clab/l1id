I disagree to the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Because you cannot be free if you are in a group , also there is less chance to interact with the people of the place you visit and you cannot explore things by yourself .

First , people want to travel to be free from their ordinary lives such as time limits and rules .
However , if you are in a travel group , there will be more rule to follow and time limits than travelling by yourself .
For example , you probably not be able to spend much time where you want to stay long and always have to be on time to get together with other people .
I would be stressed if I have not much freedom during the travel .

Second , you will get to meet more native people where you visit if you travel on your own than travel with a group .
One of the most important reasons to travel is meeting other people from other world .
However , if you are with a travel group , you only get to hang out with that group until you come back home not knowing how the people you visit are like .
Therefore , I would travel on my own to get to know the people from the places I visit .

Third , you will not be able to explore things by yourself .
You can make much memories if you deal with new things from the new places by yourself .
If you only follow the leaders of the group you would not feel pleasure of achievement during the trip .

In sum , I prefer travelling on my own to travelling in a group due to the less freedom when you are in a group , lack of chances to meet native people from other world and losing chances to explore things in the new places .
You will be filled with lots of stories if you travel on your own .
