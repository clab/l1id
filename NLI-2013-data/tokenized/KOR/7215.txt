I disagree with the statement which says , `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
The following reasons will support my opinion .
First of all , when you get to travel in a group , you always have to move with the group , which means you ca n't schedule your own course where you want to drop by during your trip .
You might go to only the places which you did n't expected to go .
For example , I was on a trip to Japan .
Me and my friend scheduled everyplace we wanted to visit for 2 weeks .
It taked a bit of time to get those imformation but it was worth it .
Suppose I travel in a group with a tour guide and miss the premiere leage , the English soccer leage , eventhough I 'm travelling England becuase it 's mot scheduled .
That will be terrible for me .

Secondly , if there is a tour guide he might tell you all the imformation about all the places and stuff .
It could be good for some people but I think studying about places you go , cultures neer it , learning history is all part of the trip .
If you do n't study about the place your visiting you might not understand their culture and old stuff eventhough someone like a tour guide explains you everything .
Because I think studying about the places is very exciting and essential for making my schedules and plans for my trip , I wo n't need a tour guide .

Also , If you are in a group you wo n't even get your enough free time in your trip because you 'll have to move on all the time with your group .
I think this problem is one of the most important problem in a trip .
I think a travel has too make your stress dissappear , but when you have to move when you do n't want to , it 'll make you more stressful .
When I visited India with my friend , we rested and read books in our hotel for a day .
Somepeople might think it 's a waste of money and time but I think it 's the best part of travelling .

However , these are the reasons why I think travelling with a tour guide in a group seems terrible to me .
I think studying about our own destination , resting there and scheduling the whole travel by myself is the most important things in my tour .
