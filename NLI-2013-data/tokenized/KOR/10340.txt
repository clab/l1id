It is usually said that successful people are full of confident .
Some are very confident about what they know how to do well , while few others have confident to try new things and take risks .
However , I strongly believe that successful people just do what they already know how to do well and that is the key for them to succeed , because of the following reasons ; Successful people are usually famous as the experts of certain area that they have studied for a long time , and they are wise enough to predict the failure .

Being a successful person , we have to be good at certain area of study or have certain talent that can be desired by others .
If Once we become a expert of certain thing , we are about to succeed or at least have obtained the possibility to be successful .
People become successful in this way .
Those who are already successful in the world , they have digged only one spot on the ground .
In other words , they show much confidence on the area that they see the potantial from .
Since they already know how to do well on the certain object , they expand their ability rather than try new things that they have not experienced before .

Wisdom is one of the crucial key point of being successful .
Successful people are very wise since they have been using their wisdom to be on the top .
They can predict what is going to happen if they get off their track .
For instance , the CEO of Starbucks , world 's most famous coffee chain , once had a thought to have some changes on the store .
He was thinking of selling some other fast food in Starbucks .
When he eventually anticipate that the class of Starbucks will be dropped down , he stopped the thinking and just doing what he has been doing .
