I fully agree with the claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
This method of teaching has been widly known and are having using through students all over the world .
And I agree with this method becaus I believe students requires full understanding of concepts therefore they could have longer knowledge , and create their own thoughts through understanding the concepts .

First of all , the most effective way to learn things would be understanding concepts and ideas .
Since students gets to undertand its concepts or the ideas , it makes them to fully understand it and also , it remains in students mind and it becomes part of their knowledge for longer than when they learn its fact .
For instant , from my personal experience , I only remember few mathmatical formulas or the scientific terms that I have memorised when I was in middle school .
Moreover , I could only memorise few things even from last year which that I have learned facts .
On the other hand , I can crystalize things that I have experienced .
For instance , I have clear momory that I have learned from experiments in biology class which I experienced in younge age .
In fact , understanding ideas and concepts are very importand to students and are more effective way to learn than it is for them to learn facts .

Second of all , Understanding the concepts makes students able to thing further more .
Interestingly , most of the great inventeries such as phone and computers were came from basic understanding of the concepts .
Thus , sometimes facts works well for students to learn complex things .
However , when students gets to understand it 's concept or the idea , it makes numuries things becaue it lead them to think more spreadly and widely .

In conclusion , it is best way for students to learn new things as creative way , and as perfect way when they understand ideas and concepts rather than when they only learn facts .
Moreover , education should work students to understand its concepts such as arts and life experiences .
