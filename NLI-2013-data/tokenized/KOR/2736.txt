As time goes by , lifestyle has changed a lot back than in the 1970's .
some people believe that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
i strongly agree with this statement as following supports .
however , i have to say that it depends on viewers who are young people or older people .

first of all , for example , my father just enjoy playing golf whenever he has time , However , i do n't like golf because it feels like boring to me. so i usually go to sea to swim for summer and go for snowboarding for winter with my friends .
i think the reason is that older people did n't have chance to have those sports which i enjoy .
basically , because i am young , i can have more chance to do something which i prefer to than my father .

in addition , older people usually like doing non-activity action such as reading , watching movie , seeding .
however , young people usually like doing activity action such as soccer , basketball .
actually , i think that these kinds of theories are natural rule .
my point is that between older people and young people have different thoughts and lifestyles .

finally , many years ago , people have to work to survive without breaking .
for example , my grandfather used to work outside untill he died .
this effect caused by social circumstance .
however , he really enjoyed his work for life .
As you know , at that time many people did for their life .
however , as i mentioned above , everything is changed by time .
of course , if i have son , my son will enjoy life much more than me. that 's why i really agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
