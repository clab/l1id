Different people have different opinions that the advantage of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects compare to having specialize in only one subject .
I strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many subjects is more benefical for social person and solve problems efficiently .

First of all , more vast knowledge allow us to be social person .
Although specific information render to think deeply , a lot of knowledge is more benefical to think widely .
In our society , where gradually increase piece of information because of internet , haves and not haves of infomarion has a considerable gap .
At this time , wide infomation is more essencial requirement for living in society .
For example , when I was watch the program of Olympic game every 4years , I need to absorb about the role of each game to totally understand whether win or not .
Morever , when face social issues such as green house , we should have a information several subjects such as the aspect of social , knowledge of science and the law of world for talking with others about them .
This shows that if we do not want to be isolated person , we should have broad knowledge .

Next , broad knowledge of academic subjets is necessary for solving problems efficiently .
When people have a problem whatever faced in life , they need to solve that for using many information .
For example , when my parent were having a problem with sell a house , they had to gather many knowledge such as economic , law and enviroment .
They wants to get a money by selling a house , so they had to consider to economical aspect in society .
Moreover , they wished to reduce tax , that is why they should to learn about law .
They also consdiered region of new house which they will transfer for more convenient life .

In conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more better .
