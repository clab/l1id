Some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
I agree with it .
When people watch a television , read newspape or walking on the street , they see a lot of advertises .
Even though people do n't concentrate about that , they already have influenced .

The first problem is the company cheats the costomers .
When the company make a commercial for selling product , they usually try to show there products as the best and they tell them only good points .
Due to they made people beilive that products does n't have any defects and costomers but it .
However , there are also many bad points .
It is one of the cheating .

The other one is overconsumption .
The commercial stumulates people want to get that products and actually they do n't need it , but they buy it .
Sometimes buying is caused to develop the economy , but typically it has to disappear .

Third reason is cost .
If they make an advertisement , they need money and when they make an advertisement that is looks better , they have to pay more .
It is going to be caused the increase .

The increase will poor people suffers from money .
The purpose of companies is make money .
Whereas they earn money , the people 's saving decrease .
The companies must make good products and after costomers will be able to judge it .
