What may difine enjoying life ?
Just having fun and not doing what they suppossed to do ?
As a younger generation person , I recent that statement above .
People in our age , became more difficult than older people do .
In my short life , I figured one thing ; what am I doing is not choice , this is requirement to live my life .

Most adults are going to their job at eight o'clock or something like that .
It is basically same as any other student .
after we are going to school we are having bunch of tests or quizes from school .
If we did not take this tests or quizes , our grade will be lowered .
Many people think this is just kidding if they compare to any adults , but this pressure is aweful .
First of all , they are going to call their parents and their parents are going to yell at the child .
This is not just stressful , it makes my life miserable .
If it is only school work , than it is nothing .
we have SAT or AP subjects exams , which are not exist in adult world .
We also have some extra activities that we need to go to .
After all of these stuffs , we finally have a vacation .
in two or three months , we are having enjoy our moment with pressure about SAT or APs for next year .

On the other hand , Adult would is rudimentary .
some older people say you are nothing but fake .
What are they basically doing for their life ?
During week days , they are going to their job or go to meeting .
If something goes wrong , they need to fix it and maybe improve it for better jobs .
There is differences between adult and young people .
Adults are choosing what they want to know and we younger people are forcing to do stuffs .
It is really different .
After their jobs or works , parents are asking how their school was and start to speak about better life .
Tt leads to us have more studying and every adults are going to enjoy their moment .
They might be watching a TV or walking for their healthy .
During weekend , while younger people are studying older people are going to play golf without any pressure .

Therefore , adults are enjoying more than younger people do .
Under certain circumstances , younger people enjoy little bit once an year .
However , adults are enjoying their moment almost everyday and they only complain about younger people .
Therefore , i believe older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
