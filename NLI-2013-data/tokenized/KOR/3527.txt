Nowadays , young people are very busy studying or doing other things , so they do not volunteer to help their communities .
In their teens they have to study for the university entrance test .
Other young people would play .
They think that helping communities is very hard .

In my community , every teenagers has to study for their own good .
The fact that they spend the day studying , they do n't have enough time to help the community .
I am a teenaged girl and I want to volunteer to support the town , but I do not have the time .
I believe that young people would like to help the community .

In their middle schools or high schools , if they have free time they would hang out with their friends .
Because they did the hard work studying , they want to rest .
Teenagers would like rest in their home playing computer games or watching TV .

In my school , students have to work for the community for amount of the time , but they would ask their dad to make a certificate which prove that the student volunteered for the work .
They think that helping the community means cleaning the streets , and doing dirty and hard works .

Students should give enough time to help communities , but they do n't .
In one reason , students have to study for the university entrance test .
Even if they have the time to do the helping , students would play with their friends to relieve .
Many young people think that supporting thier towns is very hard work to do .
