I disagree with this topic simply .
because I see the young people who help their comunities very often .
in the course of development about human living , many young people do not have enough time to helping their communities .
actually , compare with the past , it is true many people do n't help other people even if they have enough time .
but I think that cannot be serious problem of ethic in communities .

First , almost all schools has volunteer clubs for communities .
and students can learn easily that 's the right ways and that 's the good for everyone .
for example , to help somebody who is difficult to do something or cleaning streets .
moreover , there are subject for helping communities in some special schools ( but not really common anyway ) .
that 's why we can see young people who learned about ethic and volunteer .
even though they not do it too much , I believe that people in communities are satisfied with young people 's little helping .

Second , if students will help their communities during vacation , some schools gives points for score of semester .
unfortunately that 's not very good situation , anyway young people should give enough time to helping their communities .
but in my experience .
this behavior is not really useful .
many students are good volunteer but some bad young people does not help their communities really .
because they only want to get the points for semester .
besides schools cannot observe them completely , they do n't do their best .
fortunately that bad young people are not many so we can see the young people who help their communities by this second way .

As a result , there are many young people who learned what is really good and what is really bad .
and they do their best to helping their communities by many ways .
that 's why I 'm sure our society is happy because of young people .
