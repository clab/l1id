I think there are many way to trip .
but I think travel with just a few people is much better .
there many reasons can support my thinking .
One of the reason is travel with group led by guide , people should adapt their thinking .
the travel in group can be contrast to working in company .
working in company I should follow my leader , so I ca n't do what i want to do very well .
also it just contains my opinion little bit .
but working in own business or small business , they can share there opinion , and they can have dicussion , they can find best way to solve .
the trip with few people is same case as working in own business .
trip with few people , they can share there idea also they can choose best way to enjoy there trip .

Another reason , travel with tour guide , I feel not comfortable .
I should follow the trip route which planned by tour guide , also I should be part of the group .
for example , I trip the France for have great time in Effel tower in Paris .
if i trip with group led by a tour guide , the tour guide will set up the schedule for trip but there are just 3hours for touring in Paris .
so i ca n't have enough time for Effel tower , and i tour in another region that im not interested in. and it can cost much more than travel with few people .
because you should pay for tour guide , and the hotel which chosen by tour guide .

last reason , people can develop their responsible and ability of independence by traveling with alone or just few people .
and it can be more exciting .
because you should have to ask to the people in that region and search about that area .
sometime it makes you cost money and time but it can be good experience to you .

Therefore travel with few people or alone is the best way to trip and have fun in trip .
also trip is not just for fun , you can learn the culture by searching that area .
