There is an argument concerning whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
some people might say that learning one special subject is more effective way of study .
however I agree whit this statement .
because people can build their carrer and social skill .
I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea in this essay .

First , people are able to develope career through having various subject .
in other words , If someone study only in his area .
he/she only know about his field .
so his/her skills can be narrow and limited .
In my experience , when I was a university student .
my major was the Study of vietnamese .
so I could speak and write vietnamese well .
but when I graduated from school .
It is not necessary .
most company needed people who have various skills .
so I should study again .
at that time I studied broad many subject such as economics , english and so on .
Finally I could get a good job .
therfore having broad knowledge is good for showing people 's ability .

Second , student can improve their relationship with other people thank to taking many subject .
what i mean is that when student have various classes .
the they can meet different kind of people .
so it give a good chance to build their social skill .
for example , one of my friends take a lot of course in his college .
so have many kind of friends .
when he has a problem .
they try to help him .
and he can be a very sociable person .
that is good in his job .
consequentry , through having various knowledge , people can make good relationship with other people .

In conclusion , I completly agree with the statement that having various knowledge is good way of study .
because of the reason that i mentioned above .
