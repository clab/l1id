I totally agree with this statement .
There are lots of advertisements in the world .
All the advertisements about their goods contains the great exaggeration about their goods .
In my experience , I was young and I was in Korea , I watched the advertisements about new robot toys .
At that time on the Tv , it shows the flying robot that I can control it and make it fly .
I was really surprised about flying thing because I was young .
So I bought it at my birhday and tried to make it fly .
It did n't fly .
It was really big shock for me and I could not believe any advertisement from that time .

In our life , we can see many cases like mine .
In addition , I saw a advertisement about new restaurant , it says that if we come at birthday , it is free and there are alot of beneficial thing for birthday people .
So I went to that restaurant with my friends on my birthday , I expected that free foods and many things .
but i could n't get any services or beneficial things .
They said , it was only one week event so I checked the advertisement paper , it did n't mention about one week event .
I was really angry but i could n't leave that restaurant .

In my opinion , we cannot stop them .
Because it is one of the good way to make people come to their restaurant .
But we can think ourselves that we know it is fake .
So do not expect that much , we have to get ready for a shock .
When we just do n't believe the advertisement , we can have some benefit luckily , and it makes us happy .
So my conclusion is , we know it is not really true but we can just go and have fun there .
