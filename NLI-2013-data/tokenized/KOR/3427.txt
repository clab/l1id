It is often said that these days young people do n't spend enough time to be concerned about their communities .
Some people might agree with this statement because many young people become selfish because of the Internet .
However , I am strongly against the idea of youngster 's indifference about their communities because they are insighting the homepage of communities and help the lonely old people .

To begin with , the young in modern society are interested in the way how the community behaves in the area .
It is commonly observed that many young people post claiming writinga in the board of community .
Accordingly it is a myth that nowadays youngsters care only about themselves .
For example , June Kim , one of my friends , has one son , who is 8 years old .
When he went to his son 's school , he realized that the lunch menu was too bad for children to take .
As soon as he came home , he began to write the the principal of the school about this , and the lunch menu has been changed .

In addition , many young people have accustomed to helping people .
It is obvious that when many school gives the students class score according to how often they help the poor people or weak people , students are willing to help people .
Consequently , many young people help people without hesitation due to the habit in the school .

For example , my son is elementary student .
I had never taught him to yield the seat to the old , but In a bus , when an old person got on the bus , my son quickly stands up and guides him or her to his seat .
I was really proud of my son .

In brief , I firmly believe that the young already know how to participate in the community and how to help their communities .
