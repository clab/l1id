as far as I 'm concerned , It is better way to specialize in one specific subjuct .
While it is true that having broad knowlecge of many academic subject is necessary for graduation , specific subject plays a great role after graduation .
the rationale bebind this is to get a jop as well as to be a member of world .

To begin with , gaining a jop is getting harder and harder .
it is also true that if one wants to obtain the similar work with the person who graduate high school .
one do not need to learn specific subject .
In other words , It is impossible to imagine the professional jop without taking some specific courses in university .
In my country , specific lectures allow peolple to survive at their workplace .

Also , our society is getting more specific and more professional .
Even in this situation , If one does not have any professional knowledge , he or she should send their resume into a supermaket or laundry stroe .
these days the world is changing dramatically , therefore , you have to have something different
