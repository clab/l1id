Recently , people tend to specialize in one specific subject .
However I think that broadening knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful .
In this essay , I will present some reasons to support my idea .

First of all , i think that recent goal of our study does not want specialized knowledge .
Although specialzed knowledge is also needed , broadened ones are really required to us .
For example , in the applied mechanics , statistics and management are also needed .
If we do not know about them , we can only produce a safe something .
However if we know about them , we also make things cost-efficient .
By doing so , we can reduce wasted money and provide things on lower price .

In addition , boadening knowledge of many academic subjects makes us diverse .
If we are specialized on particular one , we would have narrow thought about what makes us puzzeld .
As we have a variety of knowledge , that gives us diversed view .
Thus , various knowledge may result in synergy effect .
For instance , since i was studying various subjects like statistics and mechanics , it encourage me to study hard .
Because i was boring at studying only mechanics , by doing so , i was excited to study mechanis .
As a result , i got the good grades on both of them .

Taking all those into consideration , broadening knowledge of various fields makes us more efficent , having widened visioin , and having active motivation .
We are living in a world that demands a multi-player .
