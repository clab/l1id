I disagree with the stated idea .
I think there will be more cars in use in twenty years from now .
Cars have been one of the indispensible transportation since they were invented .
And even though there have been many other transportation systems were developed , such as subway and airplanes , cars never been out of people 's life .

Instead of being replaced by other transportation systems , they have changed to better versions contionously .
Moreover , some people are very interested in buying or collecting old versions of popular cars , like classic model of `` Beatle '' .

Cars may be considered just as a means of moving .
But purposes of owing a car has changed over time , and nowadays some want cars to show their life style and personalities .
For this reason , there will be more cars in the future .

However , it 's possible that new and better means of transporting will be invented in the future , but I believe that cars will be developed to be a better means than now .
As we 've been doing this for a long time , we can find better resources for power , and also better designs for cars .

Also there will be more cars considering peole 's tastes today .
Living in a modern world , many people prefer to stay private wherever possible and want to feel at home whenever possible .
In that point , cars are the best way to choose .
I predict that fancier , more comfortable , faster , and safer means of moving than cars will appear in twenty years .

Even if it happens , I 'd choose to stay with my own car .
Cars have been one of the most attractive things people can have , and I believe people wo n't be able to resist the urge of buyig a new car and driving on the streets .
