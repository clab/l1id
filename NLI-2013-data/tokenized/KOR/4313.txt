I do n't agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think the young people nowadays do n't seem to be giving enough time to help , only because the people who say that fail to correctly observe what the young people can do , and are doing to help .
They expect the help to be in a certain form , and they fail to see that the young people are giving help because the help of nowadays may not be in that form .

For an example , let 's say there is a child with a rare blood type .
This child has somehow lost a lot of blood , and need a large amount of transfusion .
But because he has such a rare blood type , him and his parents are having a hard time finding enough blood in the hospital , and need a living donor as soon as possible .
When young people of today find out that there is someone like this , they take actions to help using new means of action , for example , by posting an ad on their internet homepages , or sending out e-mails to all the people they know , to go and donate blood if any one who sees the ad has the same rare blood type .
If the child does find the right donor in time this way , I 'll say that this is a good way of giving time to help someone in the community .

What I want to say is that if the observers expect the help to be only in some physical form , such as going out to sweep the neighborhood , they wo n't be able to see this kind of help , and they will be apt to judge the young people to be not helping .

The world is rapidly changing .
If we observe the young people of nowadays using the standards that are decades old , they might appear to be not caring about their communities .
But if we give a moment to understand the world now , and to compare and see how different the lives of today and ten years ago are , we will be able to see that the young people of nowadays
