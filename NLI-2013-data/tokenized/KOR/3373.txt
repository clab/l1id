Many people say that young people these days do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with this statement because modern society is a fast-paced world , capitalism 's basis is individualism , and that many people do n't live in one place for a long time .

The first reason why I agree with the statement is because the world we live in today goes really fast .
Every day is a busy one , with not many leisure time .
Young people are busy getting their education , and adults are busy working and earning money .
This gradually leads to less noticing the community we live in , which decreases the help given by people .

Also , almost every country in the world is run by capitalism , and the basis for capitalism is individualism .
Individualim means that each person cares only about oneself , especially things that are benefitial to him .
Helping the community may be benefitial in the future , but it is not an immediate one , so people tend to not care .

The final reason is that people nowadays do n't stay in one place for a long time , so they do n't feel interested in the place they live in .
In the past , when transportation was n't very developed , a majority of people lived where they were born for most of their life time , so they love the society thay live in .
They will be happy to help the community that they have known for so long .
In contrast , it is very easy to move around in modern society , so people do n't feel the love for the community .

There are many more reasons that back up the fact that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community , but in my opinion , I think that these three are the main reasons .
If a community gave advantages to people who help the community more , everyone would be happy to make the community they live in a better place .
