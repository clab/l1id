The technology has been improved so much past decades , solving all sorts of problem that we had , and still keep developing .
Even though the technology is fast improving , there are major problem remaing which is increasing of cars that polluting our enviroments .
I cast doubt that twenty years is too short time to prove the problem .

First , the speed of developement in technology is unbelievably fast .
No one thought that they can talk to each other and see each other in same time with the wireless phone .
However , with the technology have so far , only will be able to create another cars such as flying cars or cars that can go under the water .
This could not be the solution as the amount of cars will be same as now or even more .
It will be great improvement but would not help the problem of pollution by cars .

Secondly , last twenty years there has been dramatic difference on tranfer matters , dI believe that twenty years is too short time to think whether amount of cars will decrease .
I strongly believe that one day it will ; however with the technology we have at the moment , can not solve this problem .

In conclusion , we are having pollution problems because of increasing number of cars such as air pollution , nose pollution .
With the technology keep developing , one day amount of cars will decrease or even disappear by using new way of trans .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , this can not take place in twenty years .
