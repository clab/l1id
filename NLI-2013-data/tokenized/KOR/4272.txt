I agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communites in Korea .

First , Young korean people ( middle and high school students ) have to study hard to enter the good university .
Because they and their parents want to be successful in life .
We , korean , think that the good university is the first step to be successful in life .
When I also was a student , I just focused on the study .
so I did n't think about our communities .

Second , when we enter good university , we have to also study our subjects .
For example , I study dentistry at my university .
I always take a test 7 to 10 times per month .
so I just concentrate on study .
sometimes we have free time , but we always sleep .
and other students ( law , economy , .. )
tried to get good scores at TOEFL , TOEIC , ..
etc. they always live in library .
so if we tried to help our communities we have to contribute our time .

Finally , when we were students ( from elementaty to university ) we did n't have much experience to help someone .
I think our habit cannot be changed easily .
we always think much of ourselves .

In conclusion , if old generation in korea want to change the mind of young people not to be individualitic , they have to try to change their own mind .
we learned that my success was more imprtant than anything else .
so we are so very private .
we learned this for more than 15 years , so we ca n't change easily our thoughts .
Of course , all of them is responsible for old generation .
We , young people , have to change our thoughts .
I 'm also growing , after few decades I 'll be old generation .
That time I and my friends have to change our environment .
