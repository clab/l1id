I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they get more apportunities to play than the older people .
Another reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do is that they have much more energies than the older people and by taking much more risks the younger people get more chance to experience and learning from their life .

First of all the younger people get more opportunities to play that the older people because they have enough motivations to enjoy playing .
For example , at my age , my friends and I play often .

We go hicking , dancing in the stage or in the clubs as well , and also we sing and listen to music , which is alot of fun .
However , the older people don not get alot of motivations like us so , they basically spend their spare time in their home or in the office that they work .

Another reason that young people enjoy life more than old people do is that they have much more energies than the old people .
The old people are too old to go out and have fun because they do not have much energies than the young people .
They are very tired from their work and from their house work .
For example , my mom , who is a dentist , get very tired from her work .
When I saw her , her face is already sleepy .
In fact , she does not have any energies left to do something even other than fun .

The last reason is that the young people take much more risks from learning new things by experiencing from their school or communicating and sociallizing with different kinds of teachers , school mates , and friends .
For example , I learned and inspired from a lot of experince from the school and also the community services .

It is true that old people do not get chance to have that kinds of experience anymore because they a lot of times , spending their time in their home or from their work .

Young people enjoy life more than older people because they often get motivated from the school and by having new friends and getting to know each other .
