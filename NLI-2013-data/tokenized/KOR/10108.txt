Sometimes we can see the article from newspaper , in which the successful company or person is introduced .
They always develop their company or themselves through finding new items or new traits .
Moreover , we know they take risks whenever they try to new things .
So i agree , successful people or company try new things and take risks rather than doing just one item .

At first , I would like introduce my professor .
She was originally a high school english teacher .
In my country , Korea , the teacher is the best job to women .
It gurantees good salary and reputition .
Furthermonre , the teacher can take a rest for a vacation and get many education program about music , exercise , because these fields are necessary for the teacher to teach their students in many ways .
But she decided to be a professor .
As many people know , people who want to be a professor require a doctor degree in Univ. and it takes about 5 or 6 years to finish .
Anyway she determined to study abroad and to be a professor even though she could n't take care of her children in Korea .
I think it would the hard decision to her .
But she finish whole course perfectly , and then she became the professor .
I think she is successful person because she succeeded her dream thanks to trying new things .

The samsung , an international company , is another example .
Samsung was a small company until some decades .
At that time , samsung had only few items that it can afford .
But the chief always looked around to search what makes his company bigger .
He representatively found the field of a cell phone .
And he start to study that part even though he had many risks .
Eventually , he succeed and made his company a international one .

These two shows us how important trying new things and taking risks .
I think unless they started someting under the unstable situation and conducted what they thought , these successes were impossible .
In conclusion , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
