A growing number of people believe that specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for students than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
However , contrary to the popluare trend , I strongly believe that broad knowledge is better for students .
The rationale behind this is that it helps students to be well-arouned people .
In addition , students can work better after hiring in company .

First of all , broad understanding of various academic subjects plays a pivotal role in rasing students well-rounded people .
It is largely because , if people learn only one speific subject , the life would be boring and they can not understand other aspects of life .
Learning other subjects can broaden their horizen .
For example , my major was chemistry in university .
However , I attend other classes like art , writing .
Therefore , I can write better and understand other people well .
It made my life more affluent .

Secondly , broad understanding of diverse subjects contributes to working better in companies .
It is largely because , when students learn various kinds of subjects they not only understand their parts of the work but also they can grasp the other role 's of other people 's work .
Therefore , they can work more effectively .
To be specific , my friend , Jihuen was hired by Hyundai , which build the apartments .
Even though her major was architect she had to attend the art class and when she work at the company she could do well , because she could design better .

In conclusion , having broad knowledge is more helpful for studnets .
It is because students can be more well-rounded and work better when they hired .
