Some people say that learning facts without the understand are more important becase these days is information social .
However , I disagree about it .
There are a reason : if we do not understand idea , we can not use them .

Sometimes , we are required many information from modern society when we want to do something like writing a report an so on .
Absolutly , we can use it without understand ideas and concepts but we can not use that those are natually .
In this case , I think that it is same we do n't know it .
For example , my classmate , Haemi kim , is a student in the Columbia University ALP .
She wanted to write about a globle warming when she took an essay test .
Even though she has known it , she has not understood this topic .
While she was writing an essay , she could not writing anything .
So , she failed the test and then she had to prepare another exam .
If she figure out this subject , she could pass the exam .
That is a point , if we do n't understant someting , we do n't know it .

As a result , when we learn somethig , we have to understand what is the meaning because when we need to use the information , we can be more comfortable than we do n't understand it .
