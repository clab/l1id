People are thinking about their future or what they are going to do when they are still young or old .
Some people think that older people can enjoy life more than young people .
Because they have lots of time for lesures .
But I do n't thinks so .
I agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
.
There are some reasons I agree with this statement .

First , literally young people are young .
That means they have times to do their work , have fun within the life they got .
Actually they have to earn the money for the future , study for their college and so on .
In the United States , people work since they are 16 years old typically and they earn their own poketmoney .
Young people can do whatever they want .
But the older people ca n't .
Because they are too old to do fun thing in the world .
The body gets really slow , sick and lazy .
They might have just little energy to do it even if they have lots of free time or money .

Secondly , most of young people are open-minded .
That does n't mean older people are close-minded .
In my case , if I want to do something , I would do whatever I want .
I do n't think about advantages of that or disadvantages .
I just enjoy what I get to do .
People like to do stuff what they like .
And young people can try anything .
But for older people they have lots of limits for that .
For examples , they are not able to climb up to the mountains a lot or go swimming , get drunk , ride fun ride at the fair and so on .

Third reason is that they know a lot of things than older people .
The world is changing constantly .
Sometimes new things are coming up and sometimes old things are being thrown away from our society .
So I am saying that young people can get a lot of information about that and get to know and have fun with it .
Actually I like to do something new with my friends .
That makes me challenge for that and eventually have fun .
Young people do n't fear about the new things .
And they can accept well than older people .

Since I am young , I understand I can do anything whatever I want .
Young people have dream , thought , goals .
But I think the most thing we have to do is to have fun in our life because we are still young and have lots of time to do other stuff , open-minded and we know lots of things coming up recently and enjoy it .
So I agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
.

There are a lot of things to have fun in our life .
I do n't want to miss it and we can have fun than older people do .
