Sompe people say it is much more beneficial to have the deep knowlege in only one specifie subjuct .
In contrasts , others argue that it is much better to have broad knowledge of various academic sudjects .
Even though , knowing subjuct deeply is advantageous , i want to be on the latter side .
Because , it helps people to make many friends who are working in the different fields and it is also beneficial in raising babies .

Firstly , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps ones to get along with many kinds of people .
When we enter job fields , we have many opportunites to meet many kinds of people .
Sometimes , we face scientists , doctors , musicians , or businessman .
Let 's compare two people .
The one knows lots of things in many fields and the other one knows only one thing he or she is interested .
Who do you think can make friends if there is a party ?
For sure , the former person wins in this situation .
Because people get to know each other by having a conversation .
Besides , it is also revealed in movie .
The movie named `` Briget 's Diary '' , we can see the main actress is alone in the party because of her shallow knowledge .

Secondly , it has many good points when parents raise their babies .
Having broad knowledge is beneficial for both parents and childeren .
Since , the academic skills are made in childhoods .
If the parents know many things , for instance , in the fields of paiting , music , language , and so on , it is much easier for them to raise babies .
Furthermore , it also creats a talented baby .
Because parents can educate them by themselves since they are young .

In conclusion , i think undoubtedly that people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects have many previleges .
On the one hand , we can use our broad knowledge in making lots of friends and on the other hand , we can be a skillful parent and it also leads to make children talented .
