As the transportation system has developed , traveling became one form of enjoyment for people .
They may enjoy traveling in a group led by a tour guide , or they may go in a group but without a tour guide .
In my opinion , traveling in a group without a guide would be the best way to travel because it is cheaper , and more enjoyable .

First of all , traveling with a group , but without a guide is cheaper .
In one case , I have a experience of traveling with my family and a guide , and it made think that hiring a guide was a waste .
When I went to Tokyo , Japan for traveling , the guide was with us all the time .
Our family had to pay her transportation bill , lunch , and dinner .
However , if she were n't there , I could have ate more Sushi .
Furthermore , on a newspaper , there is always a commercial about traveling abroad .
While I was reading it , it said that traveling Hawaii with a guide required three hundred dollors more than without the guide .
For these reasons , since traveling with a guide costs more money , I prefer traveling without a guide .

Secondly , traveling without a guide is way more interesting .
When there somebody who takes you everywhere that one does not have to open a map , it is meaningless .
For example , When Eugenie , a friend of mine , visited Beijing with her friends without a guide , she could know more about Beijing .
She explained me where the Great Wall loacates and how to get there economically .
By then , I realized that traveling without a guide is more exciting since one can learn more .
Morover , when I went to Kyungjyu with my whole classmates and our homeroom teacher as a tour guide since she was born there , it was boring .
My teacher wanted to go to historical places and explain us about them , while students wanted to go to amusement park and have more excitement .
Thus , traveling with a guide is never good .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not great .
My experinces of traveling Japan , Kyouju certain prove reasons for why .
Because traveling with out a guide is more economical and exciteing , I think it is excellent to travel only in a group of people who I know .
