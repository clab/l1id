The number of cars in use has significantly increased during the past decades and it has been a controversial issue that this tendency will continue in the future as well .
Some people might claim that the number of cars in use will continue increasing possibly thanks to the increasing population in the world .
However , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , for two reasons ; high gasoline prices and increasing interest in the enviornmental issues throughout the world .

Firstly , the price of gasoline has been fluctuated over the past years , partly due to the nature of the resource - limited and will eventually dry up - , and therefore it is easy to say that the price of gasoline will continue going up .
Also partly because of the tensions in the Southwestern Asia region , where the resource is mainly come from , due to the political conflicts and war , the supply of gasoline seems to have been unstable and this situation has affected the price of gasoline considerably .
For these reasons , the price of gasoline is very likely to be unstable , and eventually , continue rising ; it would be more and more difficult to use cars financially , which could lead to a fewer number of cars in use .

Secondly , as the large number of cars in use has considerable effects on the enviornment mainly by polluting the air , the increasing interest in the protection of enviornment might bring some restrictions or limitations on the number of cars in use .
For example , in Korea , although it is not legally restricted , it is encouraged not to drive at least once a week by the government program to make the air of Seoul cleaner .
Although it is only the recommendation by government , given that the many countries and NGOs have greater interest in the environment issues than they did before , it could be said that there would be some governments which start to make restrictions on the number of cars in use in the cities to protect their enviornments .

All things considered , although it cannot be predicted accurately , I think it can be said that the number of cars in use will be less in twenty years than it is now for two reasons such as following , 1 ) the price of gasoline will be unstable and eventually will rise too much to run a car and 1 ) the greater interest in the enviornmental issues may lead the government to impose restrictions on the number of cars in use in the future .
