Specializing in one specific subject might be considered more like a person that can do better work than a person with broad knowledge due to the deepness they have in their own field of education .
However I think that broadly educated people are more useful and well made because of the trend of the present society and how the mind of an normal person works .

First , the society these days require a wide range of knowlege .
That is because almost every work done by people has something to do with other subjects .
Except for some exceptions such as researching something scientificaly .
For example people who learned only about managment do not understand other affairs that well even though those affairs are essential to business such as law and other stuff like that .
For an another example , when someone wants to make a website on the internet , he or she needs lots of areas of education such as design , computer using , and some other things .

Secondly , a person 's mind is n't appropriate for doing something that is same over and over again .
The person will think the subject as a boring subject after a bit of time flows .
It 's like eating the same thing over and over again , and it wo n't be efficient compared to studying some subjects widely .
Think of studying math for four years and not anything else .
It will be real frustrating .
But if she or he studies something else when he gets boring about studying the same subject , that will refresh him and let him study math some other day with a replenished mind .

In conclusion , I think that it is better to have a wild field of knowledge rather than to concentrate on one subject too much .
That is because the world needs it is better for studying effeciently .
