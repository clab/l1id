Even though it is called the age of specialization , it is much better to have the broad knowledge of many subjects .
I have heard some people saying that in the specialization age , as we called , it is not necessary to have all kinds of knowlege on many subject , because trying to equip all knowlege will make people busy and finally waste their time resulting in failure .

An pastor I have known for several years , many times told me about this .
He is energetic and active .
He always tries to do his best in his field .
But the result seems not to be very successful .
One day he preached `` nowadays students have been so busy and tired of learing too many subjects which are not related to their major .
Because of this , they seem not to have their own specific knowledge that they can use for the benefit of this society .
They have broad knowledge but not very useful for their success . ''
This sounded ridiculous .
Whenever he has given sermons , he was very monotonous and made the saints bored and sleepy .
Nothing interesting .
There were many kinds of people in the church and they had different background of their major .
But he always used same and rutine article .
Suppose that you are listening same story almost everytime !
Who can endure it .
When some christian gave him a question , he had no idea , even he could n't join other conversation with others .
It was a fiasco .

Having universal and general knowledge on many academic subjects can help people have broad reationship and successful social life .
And the enormous knoledge will support his specific field and lead to good success .
