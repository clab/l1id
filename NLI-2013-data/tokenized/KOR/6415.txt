I disagree with the this statement that there will be fewer cars in use in next 20years .
I think people drive more cars than nowdays .
In the future , people will have more money than now , and there will be many place to go to enjoy life .
Also people will think privacy so important .
So they would not share the car .
Many kinds of cars also effected that there would be more cars than today .

As time goes by , world is becoming so convinient place to live in , and technology improves fast .
People will have more money than now , for example my father boughts first car when he was 30 , but nowdays many university student have cars including me. many young people prefer to buy car when they grduate highschool , because they have enough money to pay the car .
Also there are lots of places that people can play .
As economy is developed people prefer to go to outside in the leisure time .
Because of young people has many chance to earn money , they go to lots of places with family , girl friend , and friends .
So they want to have their own car .
because it is easier to go there when they have their own .

In the future , worth of privacy would become more important .
The socilal life would be very complex and stressful , people want to go somewhere alone in their free time .
As for me , when I have so much stresses I drive alone to beach .
Also people does n't want to somebody interrupt when they want to rest .
For example when I was dating with my girl friend I hate to somebody is wathing me or talk to me .
If they have their own car they do n't worry about somebody disturbs them .

Last of all there would be various car to drive .
there would be various desings of car .
So if soomone who has lots of money , they world try to many cars , such as sports cars .

In future , people would have more money , and have many chance to spend thier money .
They will buy their own car to go to many places easily and does n't want to share the car .
Also various types of car would make rich people want to drive that car .
For these reasons , I think there would be more cars than nowdays .
