Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way .
But , a group tour normally has its strict schedule and does not offer the tourists in group any chance to meet many people in new place .

So , I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First , a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it .
And it means that I can not choose the place where I want go and the food which I want to eat .
For example , when I went to Thailand for the first time , I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad .
I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok , but I could n't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered .
And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening , even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night .
It was really bad experience .

Second , a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members .
Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus , it is difficult to meet many people in new places .
But if I travel alone , I can meet many people and feel their cultures .
When I went to Tokyo by myself , I met really many people there .
I could talk with them and some of them became my friends !
Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour , choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways .

All things considered , I definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all .
By going new place alone , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there .
