Certain people believe that young people enjoy life more that older people do .
On the other hand some people disagree with the idea of young people enjoying life more than older people do .
In my personal opition , I strongly agree with the fact that younger people have relatively more time to enjoy life than old people do for several reasons according to the amount of responsibility , energy and time .

One of the major reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older poeple do is closely related to the amount of responsibilities that older people and younger people have .
In my opinion , getting older means receiving more responsibility .
Based on my personal experience , as a high school student , I used to play games , meet friends , and did not worry that much on my future .
However , as I grow older , I started to feel pressure , get responsibility and worry about my future which I have to prepare from now on .
As a result , I strongly agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do .

Another main reason that young people enjoy life more than older people is based on the amount of energy that young people and old people can spend and enjoy .
For example , based on my personal experience , I used to eager to travel and visit foreign contries when I was young .
However , as a grow older and I receive more responsibility , I started to get lazy about enjoying life .
In addition , I put the studying primary than enjoying my life .
It is the reason why most parents sacrify their enjoy for their children because they have the responsibility of being parents .

Last but not least , another huge reason that young people enjoy life more that older people is closely connected with the amount of time that young people and older people contain .
As I stated above , as people grow older , more responsibilities they get .
Therefore , older people will have less time to enjoy their leisure time .

Based on the amount of responsibility , energy and time , I strongly agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more that older people do .
Therefore , I would recommend young people to enjoy their life before they grow older .
