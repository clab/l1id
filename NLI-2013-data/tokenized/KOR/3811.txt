Helping our communitis is very important .
Sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities , but it 's not very often .
I agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

One reason that I think that young people do n't spend much time for their communities is the school rul .
In high school and college they have a kind of rul - like a homework - that a student have to help his or her community at list 10 hour per year .
We could think that school has this kind of rul to teach importance of helping community , but the truth is they have this rul because it 's hard to see young people giving time for their communities .
Some people would say I saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to .

Second reason is commuties are in need of helpers .
They have a lot of things to do so thay need many people .
Almost communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people .
As long as there is no young people who wants to help the communities , communities leave works undond and this is happening a lot .

Why the young people do n't help their communities ?
It 's because young people think that spending time ofor theit communities is such a wasting time .
To change this mind of young people , we have to give them programs or opportunity to make them realize the importance of helping communities .
