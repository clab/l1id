For as long as I can remember , quite a few people have been debating on whether having a wide range of knowledge of many academic subjects is desirable or not .
Regarding this point , some people seem to go for the knowledge of many academic subjects because they think that broad knowledge enriches our lives .
However , I strongly believe that specializing in one specific subject is better since knowing of many fields is not easy and one specific knowledge allows people to plan to career .

To begin with , it is normally difficult to have broad knowlege in many fields .
In other words , learning and acquiring a vast amount of knowlege is arduous thing .
For example , I had a hard time remembering all of contents on the final exams during college life .
I needed to put all of my effort and energy in order to study many subjects , not to mention my major .
Many academic subjects rather made me disorganized and felt hectic .
It was really pointless and not efficient .
I took the exams , not understanding all parts of subjects because of the lack of time .
After all , I got a low grade in my major subject as well as other academic subjects .
This case clearly shows that culturing a huge range range of academic subjects is not helpful .

In addition , speciliaing in one specific subject is conducive to planning one 's career in the future .
In modern society , it is the most important to understand and know well in one 's specifized area .
This is mainly because , the companies set a standard in the way they recruit employeers who have superior ability in their field .
Therefore , every person is required to have exceptional capabilities in their areas .
For example , one of my friends , Min-su who specialized in English during college .
He concentrated on only his major and tried his best to understand better .
Consequently , he got a scholarship throughout all his college life .
Furtheromre , just after graduation , he got a great profession related to his major .
Thus , this also illustrates that speciailizing one specific subject is beneficial in offering chance to plan a specific job in one 's life .

To sum up , I firmly consider that it is ideal for people to specialize one specific subject instead of having a variety of knowlege of many subjects in that it is exacting to take many academic subjects and one specific subjects help them fine a decent job .
With respect to this point , there is a famous saying that if you want a well , dig one place .
