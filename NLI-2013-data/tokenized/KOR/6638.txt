I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewre cars in use that there are today .

First , the another transportations that will replace the cars ' role have little chance because of effectiveness .
Througe many years , cars have been used vary widely .
And that means another devicec to support car is prevail .
So , to make this comfortable situation people have investigated many money .
Therefore another vehicle is hardly to replace .
In same notion , if that substitutive transportation can replace that car , it 's not easy to make comfortable to use .

Second , although nowadays is called ` global world ' , car is useful when peopel have to go a short distance .
Because I mentioned , nowadyas road is very common so it 's very convenience to move short distance .
Altough now is called global world , peopel rarely go to abroad by comparison with peopel use car to go social region .

Third , people 's adjecent .
For many years people have used cars .
For that reason , people is very familer with car .
So I 'm doubt that people will try to adjust to another thing dispite of car 's comvinence .

Fourth , nowadays oil is very expensive .
And addition , the alternative fuel is not invented that sustain world wide demand .
So the transportation that will use same fuel , it 's hard to reign the car .
Although another fuel will be invented , It 's price will high because of it 's inovative right .

In conclusion , car 's efficiency , more time to use , adjunct , tangible , It 's hard cars to be reduced in twenty years .
