I agree the statement .
The reasons for the agreement is as below .
First , the main purpose of travel is seeing a famous place .
If you travel with a tour guide , the guide tell you good points related to the place .
Then you can learn more .

Second , you can meet new people in the travel group and talk about something .

Third , The guide can inform you of which way to go and where to stay , etc .
So you does not worry about being lost .
