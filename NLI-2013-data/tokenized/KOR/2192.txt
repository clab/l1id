I do agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I have several reasons to support my argument but it is not easy to make an accurate decision because enjoying life means different person by person .

Firstly , young people usually have more free time than older people do .
Because of the fact that older people have a job and have a family to support , younger people tend to have more free time .
For example , young people are usually refered as children , students and adult who is not married yet .
They have planty of time to do exciting activities and enjoy their lifes with their friends .
However , older people need to go to work and feed the family .
They do not have time to do exciting activities because their tired body need a rest during holidays and weekends .

Secondly , young people have healthier body than older people .
Younger people are more eligible to do various activities than older people .
Such as sports that needs a lot of physical ability like rock climbing and weight lifting .
Although if older people are experienced in those activities , they can do it but it is not that common .
When young people can start any kind of activities , old people need to measure their ability otherwise they might get injured .

On the other hand , older people can also enjoy their life more than young people .
If they are financially free after the retirement , they will enjoy life more than young people do .
Such as crusing around the world , travel to the unknown countries and living in a beautiful place .
This is something that young people cannot do because they need to work .
However , I believe that both young and old people can achieve joyfuol life .
