There are many opinions between the to have broad knowlege or to specilalize in one part .
I think , both of them has a goodside and badside .
Inspite of , I 'll choose the to specialize in one specific subject .
In this writing I 'll present two opinion with a reliavle reason

First of all , It is very important about knowledge about professionl .
It can be entered a good company , also save more money than amatuer .
Thesedays , develop going to fast , and needed more good surronding , For example , someone need a designer who fixed and decorated there house .
If two man wantted this jod , the one man was majored about interior design , and has a good grade and talent , Another man knows about interior design a little .
If you , what man choice in this situation ?
Maybe almost people choose the first man. so it is important about has a specialized .

Moreover , specialized job gave us a great achivement to people .
Satisfied is more and more important for the everyone .
Many peole wants to enjoy there life .
But without satisfiction and achivement person are happy ?
No way .
I saw the article about `` satisfiction about there life '' on newspaper .
The winner is has a proffesional job .
such as doctor , baker , designer ets .
In this article showed that how important has a professional carrer to people .

To sammary , I am strognly believe that , It is better to have a specialize in one specific subject .
