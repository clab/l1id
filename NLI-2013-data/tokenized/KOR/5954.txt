Today , many technological advances are being made to reduce the pollution emitted by cars .
The gas from the muffler tips of automobiles have caused a serious amount of air pollution , but nonetheless , I believe that cars will maintain their numbers after 20 years .

To start , techonology has made cars much more `` green '' , that is to say they are less harmful to the environment .
Green cars will evetually replace the modern gasoline or diesel powered automobiles , which will lead to cleaner air .
As more and more efficient techonologies make their appearances under the hood of our cars , we will all be driving a car that does little or no harm .
But , we are not going to get rid of our cars .
For example , in the U.S. it is pretty much impossible to live without a car .
Why ?
It 's because due to the large amount of land , everything is spaced out nicely enough , but in unwalkable distances .

Next , when 2026 rolls along , the advent of flying autombiles , jet-packs , etc will make it to the door of some people .
In other words , those who can afford those high-tech gadgets .
Jetpacks and flying cars might reduce the number or cars , but how many people will own such ?
Very little .
The lucky few might fly around town , but the majority of us will be driving on Route 95 on our new all-hybrid Civic .
So , technology will bring about a slight decline to the number of cars , but still not enough for us to notice the difference during our everyday commute .

However , this is n't to say that the number of cars will stay the same or decline just a little .
If technology keeps on advancing at a rapid pace , I believe that we will have invented a new form of transportation that is far more efficient than the autombiles we drive today or the ones we drive in 20 years .
If this is the case , then the decline in the number of cars is a thing that we all can look forward to .

In summary , I would say that a lot of factors will contribute to the decline or incline in the number of cars .
The real situation that we will incounter is something we wo n't find out until it is at our doorsteps .

Regardless of techonological improvement rates , I am sure that there will be at least a small decline in the number of automobiles .
If there is no decline , at least we are going to be able to live without worrying that the exhaust from our car is going to create a hole in the ozone layer .
