I agree with the statement ` Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . '
Also , young people do not have to give time to help their communities .
Nowadays , people are busy to live .
They have to work for their family and themselves .
It is hard to earn a living .
People do not have enough time for themselves .
How can they help others ?
If they have enough time and money for their communities , it is okay to help others .
However , if they do not have time and money for their communities , there is no way to help others .

Human beings are born selfish .
They first think about themselves , their family and their friends , not the people who are not related to them .
When there is enough time and money for them and for others , they may help others .
But helping thier communities is their choice .
It is not people 's duty .

However , some people think it is our duty to help others and help our communities .
It sounds good , but it is hard to do .
For example , a person who has little income which barely afford his or her family take time to help the communitiy .
It would be good for the community , but the person 's family will not eat their meals .
Helping their communities can be possible by the people who can afford their family first .

Helping their communities is not bad .
It is good behavior , and also it is for all people , not only for one or two .
But to help their communities , the first thing to do is help themselves and their family .
Helping their communities from the heart can be done just when thier family is happy .
To help from the heart ,, people should take care of themselves and their family first .
