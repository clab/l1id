Nowadays , many people can see lots of advertisements .
that is very effected to people .
so , making an advertisement is very important for the company .
I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more .
so , they can add some lie in order to sell more .
For example , I remembered that one company make an advertisement for a hair shampoo .
In the TV , the advertisement introdce that when I use the shampoo , my hair change to silk .
that 's lie and exaxerate .
but the company sold lots of them .

Second , if they tell only fact about a product on advertisements , no one will buy the product .
If I were the advertisement maker , I will not tell only fact .
In fact , many company try to show more better than to show more factly .
It 's of couse .

Third , no one intervene hardly on their advertisement idea .
many advertisements make products much better .
But If one company only express their product they really are , the company will do n't succeed .
they have to sell their product .

Therefore , a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more .
and many company try to show more better than to show more factly .
and no one intervene hardly on their advertisement .
It 's free .
so most advertisements make products looks better and want to show better than they really are .
