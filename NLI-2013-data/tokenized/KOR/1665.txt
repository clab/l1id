In my opinion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than specializing in one specific subject .
In other words , I think one should do the former first , then do the later .
From my experience , I insist like that and I can explain more details .

First , we can easily find the good example through the system of education .
You enter elementary school and start to study there .
Following middle and high school , you may learn various things thourghout many kinds of subject .
After that , you could find your specific talent or concern , dedicate yourself on that .
It means learning basic and common things first , and then concentrate something special chosen after that .

Second , it 's my regretful story .
I neglected studying when I was high school student .
As a result of that , I selected wrong major which was mechanical engineering for bacholar 's degree .
Anyway now I become military officer and prepare to enter into post graduate school public policy majored .
I could say this route is paved way .
If I had been diligent to learn many academic things when I was in high school , I could have found right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself of nowadays .

Lastly , specializing early may make one be partial .
As balanced nutrition is very important to toddler , balanced learning to youths .
If one go into specific thing too early , of course she knows very much about her subject but not about other things .
It can make her concentrate more to the specific , neglect more to all the rest .
It means unbalance .
So she may have the limit even on her subject as a result of partiality .

People say that reading is food of mind .
As you know reading is main method we can get the knowledge .
So it is very important to get nutritiants balanced .
When we feel like healthy as growing good balanced with knowledge from various parts , it 's the very time to select the specific for us .
