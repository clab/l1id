It is generally belived that the young people in today are less interested in their neighbor than previously .
Althogh some young people still spent their time on helping their communities , in my opinion young people do n't enjoy their time spend with their communities no more because of development of technology and competitive education .

Above all , the development of technology brings about the indivisualism .
In other words , because each person has amusment things such as the TV , computer , P2P in each home , people do n't need people whom we enjoy time with becasue people can enjoy enough their time using this eqpuipment .
For example , when I was in secondary school , I would rather spend the time on playing game by computer than playing game with my friend in playground or house .
Thus , such a indivisualism allows people concentrate on just oneself , thereby making people spend more time in their house and not giving enough time to helping their communities .

Moreover , the competitive education make young people not helping their communities .
In particular , today 's educaion enable baby go to the private academy to become more smart children .
In this process , young children believe that more important things in success life is concentrating on myself not others .
For instance , parents prefer to their children to concentrate on only study than help other people .
Therfore , because such a competitive education not allow children spend their time on things except study , young people do n't have any chance to help other people .

In conclusion , I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their local neighbor any more for the reasons that I mentioned above .
Not only High level indivisualism but also competitive education makes young people not be able to spend their time on helping their communities .
