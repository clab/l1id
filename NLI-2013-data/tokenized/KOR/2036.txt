I do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of the following reasons .
This statement depends on what you think is young and old .
First , all people have different point of a view .
Usually , young people are focused on activities , and they think that 's important for them .
By the way , most older people like to be calm all the time , and they enjoy their time with their family or their life partner .

Second , older people have more money than young people .
many older people worked hard to make money , and after they retired , what they can do is spending money for themselves .
Frankly , money does an important role in people 's lives .
However , young people got to work hard to make money , and even if they have the money , they have no time to spend the money .

Third , older people do n't have worry about their family too much .
Most older people live without their children .
They only need to care about their husband or wife .
But , young people need to take care of their children a lot if they have .
They easily can get stressed out from raising children .

Fourth , older people think about everything calmly .
They have lived longer than young people , so they can understand things easily .
They do n't act too fast or too aggressive .
Their lives have not many things to change .
By the way , many young people are busy , that makes them to think aggressively and furiously .
They do n't think about their behaviours .
If someone does bad thing to them , they would get angry and they do n't think about what made other person to do bad thing to them .

I strongly think that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
