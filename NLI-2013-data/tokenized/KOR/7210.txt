Those who consider having a trip by a tour guide is the most comfortable way to travel .
However , I think , it is better for us to take a trip by ourselves .
There are two major reasons .

First , having a trip by ourselves helps us to have self-realization .
Some people might say that it is possibe to feel self - realization in that they made it following by a tour guide .
However , what matters is not by following others , but performing by ourselves .
As society is getting more complex , the competition is getting more fierce .
Thus .
the role of being reader has changed .
It was just to plan for a daily life in the past , but now it is to organize and perform alone .
Also , there is not denying that being a reader is more important to survive in dog-eat-dog society .
For example , I took a travel by myself wthout a tour guide .
Even though my parents worried about it because they thought it was quite dangerous , so they suggested me to follow a tour guide .
By taking a trip without any a tour guide , I can not only organize my schedules , but also have my own free time .
If I had to follow what the tour guide say , I would be stressed out due to dirctions from the tour guide .
In this way , take a trip in a group led by a tour guide is not desirable for us .

Moreover , when it comes to the money , it is better for us to take a trip without a tour guide .
It is generally agreed that we spend a lot of money while we take a trip .
For example , we have to get accomodations for sleep and pay for the transportation fee and so forth .
In my opinion , .
getting a tour guide is the waste of money , we can not only buy some sourvenirs for our parents of friends , but also get a the fancy restraurants instead of paying for a tour guide .
Let 's assume that the two students who travel in Europe with same money .
The one student takes a trip by himself .
Thorough enough money , he can pay anything what he wants .
On the other hand , the counterpart joined to a group for following a tour guide .
Due to the fee for getting a tour guide , he can not do many things what he wants , just he had to follow what the schedules were fixed in the list .
Who can have more fun with enough money ?
I can definitely say that the latter regrets that he joined to a group for following a tour guide .
From having more fun with freedom to not spending a lot of money for getting a tour guide , there is nothing better than taking a travel by our selves .

To sum up , I do not agree with the statement that being a member in a group led by a tour guide is best way .
This is because , by taking a travel by ourselves , we can have self-realization and save some money instead of paying for getting a tour guide .
