I agree to the opinion of need for having broad knowledge of many acadeic subject .
Reasons are as below .

First , we usually experiece lots of situations and meet so many people everyday for whole life .
To resolve problems from them and answer many questions , we need know various subjects regarding respective cases .
In case of me , I am responsible for purchasing departsments in company .
I should buy so many items used for various purpose .
I must learn about equipment , energy , electricity , and so on .
For each product purcahsed , I need specific information and study without stopping .

Second , one who have only studied the specfic subject can not think with creativity .
Academic subjects have somthing in common , but also differences .
They can be exchanged between each other and improve themselves and invent new ones .
For example , medical category meets music and can make new academic territory that make patients better with musical instrument or music .

Finally , the one with broad knowledge can enjoy his life .
He can choose job and plan for life freely because he has basic competive skill for various categories .
He have more possibility for his life than others .
If one had many academic background , he could quit his current job and experience new works for life .
Ii did not take much times for changing because of his preparance .

Now , I dreams new world for future .
For that , I restarted my study and try to broad my knowledges for various subject .
It need my efforts and time , but deserve it .
