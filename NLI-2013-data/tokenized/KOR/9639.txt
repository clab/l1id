Throughout history , successful people tried or invented new things and took risks to accomplish their goals .
If they only followed the way that they knew how to do well , they would not be successful .
Therefore , by doing so , a person can become a successful person .

When a person tries to make new things or think differently with others , he or she will have a better chance to accomplish the goals , which means they are successful people .
Steve Jobs , a C.E.O of Apple company , led their company to invent a mp3 called `` ipod . ''
When other mp3 industries were trying to reduce the size of their products and the capacity of memory card , Steve Jobs was working on making new types of mp3 .
Ipod could hold many numbers of song and it was really successful .
Nowadays , almost everyone owns Ipod or wants to have one .
Therefore , he was a successful person because he tried new things and invented a new thing .

In addition , successful people try new things by making adjustments or changes .
My soccer coach was a really famous guy and his name was well-known in Boston area .
When he first became our coach , he made a lot of changes for the team at the first practice .
Some players on the team used to say the formation he suggested does not fit on the team but the coach pushed his ideas by taking risks .
We ended the season with fourteen wins , two ties , and 2 losses and we became champion on our league .

Furthermore , it also goes well with the historical event when Jefforson purchased Louisiana .
Jefferson sent his men to buy only small amout of land near the Mississippi River but they ended up getting the whole land of Louisiana with fifteen million dollars fom Napoleon .
Since Jefferson was strict about spending national money , he was concerned about this .
Fianlly , he decided to but the whole land of Louisiana by taking risks .
The Louisiana Purchase became very helpful to the United States because it dobled the size of the nation and increased the commerce .

Throughout current event , my personal experience , and historical event of the United States , it proves that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they already know how to do well .
Taking risks and doing something new are the only ways the became a better person in our lives .
