In the 21 century we are facing the energy , environmental pollution and overpolulation problems .
However , the cars has been kept producing everyday .
as the population grows the demand on cars will increase .
In 20 years from now on , there will be more cars than now on the based of following three reaons .

First , the lack of energy will never stop producing cars because the new type of energy are now being invented .
For example , the hybornate dioxgen cars are already commercialized in some developed countries .
other than dioxgen , new source of enegy is now on the process of development .
Thus , ultimate consumption of gas will not hinder the producing the cars .

Second , the lack of space for transportation will be solved through developing new method of route .
In the future , the cars will use sky as its main stream of transportation .
We have seen flying cars in the sky way in many future movies such as back the future .
The cars may use the underground as its major transportation routye in the future ,

Third , the demand of cars are increasing now .
Before 20 years ago not all the people in the world could own his or cars .
Since peiople in undeveloped countries had not enough money to purchase the car , they could not own their cars .
However , the some of the undeveloped countries such as China are growing its economy , its people demand the cars .

In conclusion , the lack of energy and space will never be hinderance of usage of cars .
Meanwhile , the economic developments of some countries will increase its demands on cars .
