I do not agree with the following statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
My definition of `` traveling '' would be feeling the breeze and have relaxation , but with tour guide i would not feel comfortable at all .
From my experience i went to Yellowstone National partk withing a group led by a tour guide .
it was very helpeful to learn about Yellowstone National Park but they had limited time , so if i want to go somewhere to see more informationa or to take a picture i would not have time because we would have to move on to next place , i did not have any individual time to spend with my family .
All i did was walking and listening , walking and listenning over and over again .
I felt like this was more like school field trip not traveling .
Of course you can counterpoint with my decision , like what if you do n't know the direction or you have no idea what to do ?
Well i thought about that too but the whole point of traveling is you look for direction and find the place and keep searching for new things .
I got lost several times during my trip but it was all worth it because next time i went there i could remember clearly because i got lost once and now i think about that moment i think it 's good memory to have .
i 'm not saying that you should not have a plan for your trip but with tour guide you schedule is going to be so tight that you will not have anytime to have your own quality time , all you do is sleep at night because you are so tired from touring .

In conlcusion the best way to travel is to travel by yourself or your friend but not in a group led by a tour guide , it will make the trip worse .
