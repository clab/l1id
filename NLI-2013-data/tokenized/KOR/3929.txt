Todays , many students are forcing to perform a lot of role .
They have to both study hard and help community .
But they have enough time to perform various role .
It can be explain to two reason .
I will explain it in detail .

First , Although , they want to participate in community like activity helping orphanage or the poor , their parents does n't like it .
They think that their children have to study more for surviving competition .
they give a good circumstance to study for their children .
and They always saids that studying is most important .
For this reason , student study harder in their school and their academic institutions .

Let me take my friends as an example .
His initial dream was a counselor for poor person .
He interested in books and class such as counselling for community .
But their parents disagreed his idea .
They always argued because of this problem .
After all , he had to give up his dream .
And he made up decision teacher their parents want .

Secondly , the society does n't ask for these oppourtunity .
Students are likely to think that time to helping communitie does not neccessary .
Instead of this time , they asked for them more high grades in their school and some qualification such as Toeic or Toefl grades .
For them , community exercise is not their interesing requirement .
During school period , students often worried about their grades and evaluation from their teacher or professor .
In order to give a good grade , they have too much efforts .
However , no one worry about their community .

In conclusion , From these two reason , young people do not give enought time to helping their communities .
They may want to experience this time to help other people .
So , for solving a problem , both household and work place help young people .
