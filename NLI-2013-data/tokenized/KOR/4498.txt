In these days , advertisements are really important part for the companies .
People who make ideas for advertisement always try to find creative and impressive ideas .
In my view , it ca n't be avoid for the companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements .
There are so many advertisements in the word and the companies want that people are interested in their products .
Besides , to make interesting advertisements , they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points .

First , most advertisements are made to grab people 's eyes .
For example , we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on TV .
Whatever , they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences .
But every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently with others , because it need to grab people 's eyes .
And it will be connected right away with their selling .

Also , the advertisements have to show only good points to people instead of short points .
We do n't have any those kinds of rule .
But , there are no more silly things than showing your products very candidly .
If you say to people that my products are really really good but it have some short points , too .
Then , no body will buy your products , because the short points are looks like bigger than good points for customer .
Therefore , in customers ' view , the companies or sellers are telling a lie to customers or make customers to think the products are better than they really are .

Accordingly , it 's true and it ca n't be avoid for the companies and sellers to make their products seem much better in advertisements .
They have to grab at least one more customer in rough advertisement 's world .
And they have to show only their good points to sell their products .
