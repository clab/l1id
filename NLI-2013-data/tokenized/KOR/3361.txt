I agrees with the statement that the young people recently do not spend enough time on helping their societies .
Because of that fact , many older adults complaint about the lack of vounteering activities of young generation into the society .
However , young people have several crucial reasons for that .
I can point out two main reasons for this situation : absolute lack of time given to young people for helping communities and enhanced status of communities compared to the previous .

First , there is no enough time given to young people for helping the communities because of doing other important things .
These days , the competition for the job and money between young people are getting more severe and complicated .
As the certain preferred jobs among young people are limited and many young people want to achieve it , they really need to satisfy various requirements requested by the company .
For example , as the society is getting enlarged to the global world , the fluency in other languages are critical .
This makes young people to go abroad for certain periods to study other languages and broaden their view .
However , this usually costs a lot for the young people to afford which makes them to work many hours concurrently in their youth .
Other general requirement for young people from the company is to have a experience of internships in a big company prior to enter their company .
So , they need to prepare for the applications and interviews for that .
All these requirements forces young people to work on many things during their youth .
Therefore , in order to successively achieve their goals , they will not have enough time to volunteer for the community .

Second , the status of the communities become much better and enhanced compared to the previous period which all the citizens needed to participate on developing communities .
If our communities has been struggling in to the severe problems such as the long-lasting drought , wide spread of contagious diseases among people , or extreme overpopulation of abandoned elders and orphans , young people would be willing to participate to make the cummunity better .
However , the current cummunities does not seem to require all young people to participate in making a better community .
It looks like it can be achieved through the help of young people who have enough time and older people who can be actively involved in communities based on their matured and various experiences .
