i think it is more important to use their ideas and depend on their imagination .
of couse every ideas can be based by facts .
but sometimes it 's worng because students have to try to think creat things someyears ago .
many school forced students to study with fomula and memorize only fact .
they did n't allow students to speak their opinons freely .
but these day , many systems have changed in school .
they ecourages students creative activity .

when the childhood is important to student they do n't know well about the society and future and around many things .
the free thinking can be helpful in our society .
these thinking can produce more advaced future .
just to learn the facts and memorizes block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything as much as they can .

for example , i read the book a few days ago after reading the book i agreed with it .
the book include about fomula education .
the childeren learn mathmathics in school they have to solve the problem but they ca n't count the number well .
when they learned mathmathics they were foced to remeber the formula and they always studied almost same questions .
sometimes they faced higer problems but also they depended on the fomula .
so , oneday their homeroom teacher asked them `` which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2 ? '' children answered `` 1/4 '' they knew only bigger number .
they could n't think about the amout and range and degree .
so i suggest that they shoud be learnd with new way like experiments and expression their think , even if it 's worng .

another one is about the art .
art include alot of things .
such as drawing and taking a picture and acting so on .
i want to say about the acting actor or actress do n't know how to act and speak before getting the paper with their role .
they have to act depend on themselves .
and have to imagine and understand the situation .
the fact out the situation is not enough to make a movie audience expect to see the scenery which they ca n't do and ca n't think .
so the filmmakers have to satisfy such the people .

in conclusion , i think it is better to understand and concepts about the problem and situation and everything than to learn only facts .
