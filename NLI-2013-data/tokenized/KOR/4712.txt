I agree the opinion that most advertisements make poducts make better than they are .
Now we live in the high tech advanced society in the 21st century .
All over the world are getting more smaller by using the computer use .

We can exchange information togethe by all kinds of communication systems such as internet and mass media .
Even though we purchase one items , we try to get informations all of resources .
For the good example , most advertisements make customers guarantee their products .
In order to become good brand products to appeal to customers , the company focus on better products .

We can n't deny the advertisement importance to relate the good products .
Most consumers think that better products are introduced into the televions , radios , and other mass medias .
Most advetisments should be implied that advertisements products gurantee good gualities to attract the customers .

Now most company recognize that advertisement products should be the best products than other one to succeed the business .
To take example Coca Cola drink , it is not American drink any more .
It is the World drink all over the global village .
Without advertisments , it ca n't be exist any more .
In order to survive the world brand drink , they have continued to improve the best soft drinks than other one .

In the conclusion , I want to insist that more advertisements products should be recognized the better products than they really are .
