Cars are indispensible thing to live in this modern life .
When I was young our family did n't have a car and it was n't strange thing at all .
In contrast , now our family owns two cars and also it is more difficult to find someone who does n't have a car in these days .
We need cars in order to live in this morden life for many reasons .
However , I do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than now .

Cars are important to live , right ?
However , let us think what is more important thing to live .
Can you guess what I am talking ?
Yes , I am talking about the enviormental issue .
Again , cars are essential to live , but the earth , air , nature are much more important in order to maintain your life .
The conservation nature activities are really popular these days .
We have been killing our very home by overusing cars .
Then , people started to realize how they have been doing something wrong .
I am Korean , from Seoul , one of the biggest cities in the world .
In Seoul , there are thousands and thousands of cars .
If you see the sky in distance , we can see how dark it is .
We know it is comfortable to use own car .
However , we also come to realize that it is the time to protect our nature .
So , we have started a compain not to use a car even a day a week .

I guess , some people might contend that the life is getting busier and busier , There are some work to be done ASAP .
No time to wait the bus to come .
We need a car !
However , there is another reason why I believe that less cars might be used in the future .
Here , the advent of the Internet .
Now you do n't really go in person to talk and to do soem meeting , you can use the internet and do video conferance .
Futher , I am sure there will be better way to work with a person in distant later .
Like alternative transportation which does n't cause the air pollution .

In sum , if all the relevant factor are taken into account , we should n't overuse a car .
I do hope many people think our nature first than their own comfort .
That 's why I think there will be fewer cars than now in twenty years .
