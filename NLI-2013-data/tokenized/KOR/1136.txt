Nowadays , there are ongoing statesments which people have to learn only one subject specific or learn several subjects .
Somepeople think that people have to learn one subject in detail , because if people go out to social they definitely attend company which is related with they major .
However , I firmly believe that people have to learn many academic subjects .
There are two reasoens which is comunicated with another field people and understand how world goes .

First , if people learn several fields knowledge , we can communicate with another field person .
Most of people think we do not use another knowledge when we get a jod .
However it his a misleading information .
For example , if my job is accoutant , I always met several job person such as sometimes I will meet bank job person , sometime I will meet proffessor .
If I met another feild of person , I should talk something such as familiar with meeting person .
In that case if I just talk about one specific subject , they will definitely boring .
If we learn several knowledge , we can know more several fields person in our life .

Another reason is that it is hard to know how our country goes .
A lot of news talk about several field story such as economy , biology .
According to Cho-Sun daily news which is published in Korea .
They reseach Who can understand the news more correctly .
They made two groups .
One is accuately learn one subject specific , and another group learn many academic subject .
In conclusion of this research , 73 percent of the latter group people can understand the new more correctly .

In conclsion , as I mentioned above , I agree that broad knoledge of many acdemic subjects are more better than learn one specific subjects .
