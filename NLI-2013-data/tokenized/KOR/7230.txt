Some people said that travels with guides are boring and noneffective because they have to move according to maden plans .
But I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

To begin with , guides provide services for travelers to enjoy the well-known places for its fullest .
Because guides have lots of knowledge of places , travelers are not needed to prepare to know about them .
As a result , they can spend remained time to enjoy the travel .
For example , when I was in high scool , I went to Je-ju island .
A beautiful guide helped me to acquire a number of information I 'd never known and I remember the full story of Je-Ju island until now .

On top of that , we do n't have to make plans owing to guides .
Usually people make an effort to plan where to eat and sleep , and what route to go through .
But guides get rid of all concerns .
Because they have already held many travels and had maden plans .
We are required to just enjoy the travel .
We ca n't watch places that are not in plans , of course .
But we are able to get enough information .

If I have a chance to travel , I would like to go to America .
It has very extended territories and many beautiful sceneries .
But I do n't know where to go first , sleep and eat .
Although I can prepare the plan through many books , but I have no time to spend to it .
In conclusion , I have to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
