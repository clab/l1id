It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Concepts are the most confidence state in the accuracy of many facts .
Ideas and concepts can give more informations effectively and ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime .

Firstly , concepts are the most confidence state in the accuracy of many facts .
Facts may remain for short amount of time .
In other words , facts are not very accurate .
However , concept is made from many facts .
People gather many facts from books or experiments and they analyze datas .
Therefore , it is more accurate and can be used for long time .

Secondly , ideas and concepts can give more informations effectively .
For example , a teacher gives many facts to the students .
Students will not understand the facts .
Although teacher explains the fact , students may have difficulties to understand them .
Facts can be ambiguous to students and students will start to memorize the facts without understanding them .
Therefore , students will forget the facts more easily .

Thirdly , ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime .
A student ca n't imply the facts successfully in the real society .
For example , a doctor knows a high fever can kill a person .
However , he does not know why high fever causes death .
Then , he ca n't find the solution of the problem .
When a doctor knows the concept of the problem , he will have idea what it causes the death .

To conclude , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than it is for them to learn facts .
Ideas and concepts comprise many facts .
Ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime .
