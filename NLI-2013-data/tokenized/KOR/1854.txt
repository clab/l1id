Older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
From my perspective , the world is made for older people , instead of younger .
When you are young you get ignored for what ever you do by olders .
Also , the world is created because olders made lots of efford to develop the world .
When you are older you can experience whatever you like , you can have freedom , and you have power to control youngers .

When you are older you can experience what ever you love .
You can drink alchol , you can go to anywhere you like , and you can choose what to do for the career .
When you are young you are ruled by parents that they only want good , model stuents .
They want you to do well in studies , sports and anything .
I myself had difficult life when I was young , I was kind of stuck with my parents that , I could n't do whatever I like .

When you are older you can have freedom .
For as long as you like , you can go the wherever countries you like .
If I turn thirty , I want to go around the world and explore different cultures .
When you are young your parents want to be with you all the time .
They do n't want you to go anywhere but the house .
Thats what older people can enjoy life more than younger people do .

When you are older you have power to control over young people .
Say , you are police you have power to rule over young people , and teachers can do it too .
Young people are just the step to be olders .
That 's why young people can not enjoy life .
They are limited to enjoy life .
In other hand olders have so much time and energy to enjoy life .
Also the vision is different , between young people and older people .
Older people have much more wider views than young people .
That 's how older people can enjoy their life .

These are the reasons why older people are better than young people .
Older people can experience , have freedon , and have power .
World is like the world to older people not for the young people .
If young people want to explore better life , they should study hard and may have patience to be older people .
Older people enjoy life more than young people do .
