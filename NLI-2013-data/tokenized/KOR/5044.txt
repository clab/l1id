I agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Many companies need to sell their products as many as they could .
This is the main goal for each of the companies .
In order to be successed , they need to make people to know about the products .
One of the ways to let peple find out about products is the advertisments .
Some times , people do not like the advertisments because they make products seem way much better than they really are .
And I think , it is true that many of companies make the advertisment a little bit different than the real products .
The companies need to catch people 's attention toward their products , so they have to make the advertisements of thier products really good .
If people try a new product becasue of excellent advertisement and the product is really good as the advertisement that they saw ; it is good for both of them .
However , the producer should not make the low quality of products and spread non-sensed of the advertisement to just make people get interested and buy the products .

Also the reason why the companies are making the advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is because they have confidence and pride of their products .
The companies are really willing to people to buy thier products .
Moreover , it is kind of the competetion between company and another .
Usually people are noticed about new product by the advertisements , so the company which makes better advertisement , the chance of selling more products is higher than others .

To conclude , some times many of companies make unrealistic advertisement , but it is the right way to run a bussiness .
In order to survive in the tough society , they can only make the advertisement extremely good .
