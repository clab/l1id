In the present , general young people do not want to participate in their community .
I storngly belive that if one helps their community , he certainly has lots of advantages .

Helping community brings various beneficts to us .
of course , the behavior that support community does n't give vast positive things .
however the advantage of helping community can eclipse their disadvanges .
Moltly community can give financial aids to the poor effectively and they support for discarding negative aspects of society more fast and useful than individual person trying to decrease the rate of negative aspects of society .
Hence if one gives helping to community , obviously he can add power to community and he is able to affect positive things to his socitey effectively .

A community provides lots of experience to someone that participate in the community .
because a community creates events that help to increase positive quality of society .
for example , they support varied aids to minor people .
they send community members to minor people for giving the hope of living .
so if one is component of the community , he should take in lots of helping events .
so he can experience lots of valuable things .

Helping the community contains lots of valuable things .
therefore it is recommend for young people to give eoungh time to helping their communities
