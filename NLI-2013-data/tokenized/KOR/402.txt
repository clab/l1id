Some people prefer to learn knowledge of one specific subject as they think to study lot of subjects is time consuming .
However , I think to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial for the people .
As the subjects are little bit connected one another , it will be helpful to learn other subjects .
Also , the more subjects someone have , the more choices can get in choosing majors .

Firstly , subjects are conntected one another .
It can make people to learn lot of subjects .
For example , if I have to solve math problems , I have to learn both English and Mathematics .
That is because I have to understand what the problem requires and to learn how to solve it .
It means that even if I have little knowledge of many subjects , if I have chance to learn one specific subject , I can learn more effectively because I have basics of the subject .
However , in case of studying one subject , one have to learn only the subject he/she choose and if one wants to learn other subject , he/she have to learn it from the basic .

Secondly , people can get broad choice in majoring .
As one have lots of knowledge , he/she has to choose what subjects specially interested in .
For example , in case of studying one specific subject such as music , person only have choice to choose music major .
However , in case of learn lots of subjects , I can have many choices in majors .
Also , if someone has problems of majoring specific subject , he/she can transfer to the subject that he/she learned .
In case of studying specific subject , it can not .

For the reasons I mentioned , I want to suggest people to have broad knowledge of academic subjects .
Because It can give people to learn lot of subjects and people can get lot of choices in choosing majors .
