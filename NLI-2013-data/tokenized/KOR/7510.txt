How do you like to travel by yourself with a tour book or with a tour guide 's leading ?
Many variables can exist that which way to travel is the most influential .
Regardless of the possibilities , I strongly support that traveling in a group leading by a tour guide is the best way to travel because of the substantial amount of information one would get .

Being in a group positively makes a person to know more people .
From my experience , a group tour opened my eyes more toward the world .
I had two trips to New York city : the first one by myself with a tour book and the second within a group led by a tour guide .
Going to the New York city by myself with my own knowledge put me in such a hardtime .
I guessed that with a tour guide hand book , I would be able to handle the situations well .
However , the prediction was completely wrong .
I was lost and for finished the tour in a week instead of the original plan , three days , because of my lack of ability .
However , the second trip to N.Y.C with a tour guide in a group was only two days and the trip was very enjoyable .
I learned a lot of new facts about the city from the peers .

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide would certainly cost more .
In this case , one has to weigh the price that he would get from a tour guide more .
By traveling with a group he can meet new people and interpret the places in more different ways .
I went to Italy last year with in a group with a tour guide .
The trip was more expensive than I would just go with my friends .
My friends and I were in the same group and within the group we met a lot of people .
By meeting these new people , we could apply different knowledges and understand the Rome with diversity of information .
Although traveling by oneself might be a good experience , traveling in a group is better because of the amount of the information one would get is umlimited .
