There will be less cars than nowadays , in twenty years time ?
My answer to this quetion is no .
As the technology improves , there must be other transport that can replace the car , which is the most importatnt transport to people these days .
People might invent something much safer , faster and more comfortable .
However , I think it is just going to be an improvement .

What i mean by improvement is that they change the shape , fuel that car uses or even electronical and technological things that car requires .
For example , automatic car .
Automatic car is controlled by the computer system in the car so that driver do not have to drive him or herself .
If they wishes to drive then they can change it back to mannual mode .

Also , fuel that cars needed migth be change in twenty years time .
These days most of people use gas or patrol .
But in the future we might use solar energy or electrcity instead of gas or patrol as its fuel .
There are some cars already use electricity but it needs more improvement to make it perfect .

Futhermore , car might be able to travel above the water or under the water , not just on the road .
I 've seen a bus once in Liverpool that it can travel on the road and above the sea .
It can be easily changable so that people can travel with their car above the water as well as on the road .

To sum up , there are so many improvements can be made without inventing something new .
Beside , i think it is better to improve cars than inventing somethin new as we are used to it .
