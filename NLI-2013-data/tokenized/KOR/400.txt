Today , we are learning to various subject about math , history , etc .
Even if our knowledge was broad , we did not know deeply about it .
I disagree that it is batter to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all , if we will take broad knowledge , we are dangerous about our life .
Many people know many thing , but many of thing are incorrect .
For examful , I know that customers are king .
However , my knowledge is wrong .
Customers are king and supplers are vary importent too .
That is very dangerous .

Second , if you going to dactor , you will going to specialize doctor than broad doctor .
Broad doctor have not his specialize knowledge .
Third , if we know specialize knowledge , we will get more money .
For examful , Finally , we learn to deeply about specific subject .
If we have specialize knoeledge , we will live more good life
