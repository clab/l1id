I agree with this satement .

Let me say definition of car first .
According to our common sense car is a kind of transportation .
It has a wheel and engine to make power .
It consumes gasoline or disel .

This is traditional concept of car that we knew .
But in the future those definitions are can change .
For example , future car can move without wheel and driver .
May be it dose n't have to run on the street .
Future car can use solar power , elecrticity and water .

It will be semi-airplane .
But shape look like a car and function will be quiet diffrent .
Sometimes we see in sf-movies like `` star-wars '' .

These days air pollution is becomes big issue in this world .
Main cause of air pollution is a car .
Many motor companies are developing electric car and hydrogen car .
It can be a solution for reducing air pollution .

But still it is not a popular car .
Price is very high and function is not perfect .
However within ten years it will be more popular car than present .

Modern hig-technology is changing rapidly .
Think about computer and electronics .
It ca n't compare with just ten years before .
Changing is more faster than our imagination .

I believe that ten years of tufure has same value of era with 50 years of past .
It means twenty years of our future has same value with one century .
During last ten decases how much changed our world ?

It was really beyond our immagination .

We will experience again , those kind of rapid changing in our culture within twenty years .

Therefore I can say twenty years later we will use diffrent kind of transportation with car .
I do n't know what we call future transportation .
But it will be diffrent with traditional cars .

Traditional cars we will see in the museum .
