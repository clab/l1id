Each person has his own way to enjoy his life .
Some peeple think that young people use thier time more funny than the adults , while others think that the age does n't make any connection with enjoying life for people .
Personally , I think that the age is n't the only factor to check the enjoying life quality .

Among many factors that help people enjoy their life , the first factor is a hobby .
Having hobbies makes people use their time useful .
I have one friend who has a hobby , making pro-models .
If he had spare time , he would go to pro-model shop .
He actually likes that kind of making .
So , I 've never seen that he wastes thier spare time useless .
I think he know how to enjoy his life by his own way .

Another factor is a friend .
From kindergarten 's time on , people usually spend thier time with their friends .
With friends , we did our homework , played outdoors , and struggled with them .
We ca n't imagine the life without our friends .
This means having how good friends help people to enjoy their life more .
I have a good friend .
He seems like he always prepares funny time with me and our other friends to me .
If he were n't exist with me , I would get stuck in boredsome .
Whenever we have spare time , he schedules a tour plan and watching movies and sports game .
Thanks to him , I doubt that I actually enjoy my life more than others .

Lastly , having more information make us enjoy our life more .
Without any information , we ca n't enjoy our life .
Even though , there are many things to enjoy , if we do n't know these things are in vain .
This means we need to get more information in order to enjoy life .
I usually read the megazine which has a information of space of trip or famous tour places .
By using it , I can get many chances to take a trip to the place for which I 've ever heard been .
In our nation , I could travel many unque islands that many people could n't get reached .

To sum up , I think that there are many factors that could help people to enjoy their life more .
Apparently the age is a kind of fator , but having hobby , having good friends , and having more information also important factors .
