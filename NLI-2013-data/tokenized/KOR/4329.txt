In present days , young generations are tend to do not spend their time for society .
It is gives from individualism community .
And I also participate in this case .
And my frends too .
In more detail , I 'll give my opinion about this situation , and what makes young guys to like that .

First , the individualism is increasing more and more because we are living in democracy society thet makes we to survive with each other , and we have to be winner , so eventually we can get more better job , choose more developed many options .
so we do not have much time to spend time to community because compete and improve by self .

Second reason is the generation is getting devide .
Old generation and young generation .
Each part have to make good relationship but getting worse .
because individualism make us to having less respectation .
So Young generation think do n't need to help old people although they are much more weaker than us physically .

Third , The government is seemingly not respective .
So young people think that we have no goods from goverment .
It makes us to helpless person .
In mass media , we can see easily about governments bad things .

We are living in very fast alternative society .
And it is specific that young generation will be get old also .
Than we also ca n't
