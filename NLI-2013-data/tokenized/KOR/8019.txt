Some peopel say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
However , I disagree with the statement because I have felt that facts can automatically teach ideas and concepts in many situations .
In history and chemistry class , the learned that I was able to learn complex ideas and concepts by simply learning facts .

In my history class , U.S. History 1 Honors , understanding the flow of events is as important , or more , as memorizing tons of factual informations .
When I took the course 's first test in the beginning of the semaster , expecting their to be only factual and straightfoward questions , I was amazed that how many ideas , concepts , and abstract questions appeared on the test .
For upcoming tests , I tried to understand all these idea questions by asking myself questions like `` why did this happen ? '' or `` why did this person tried to accomplish this ? ''
However , I found myself often lost and getting these types of questions wrong on the tests .
Then , I figured out a new way to get around this problem .
It was just to memorize more and more facts !
By knowing a lot of facts that have happened , I was able to gather all these informations and draw conclusions out of these facts .
Then , I was able to answer the troubling idea and concept question more accurately , and I started to understand the history as whole .

In addition , my chemistry class seemed like a pure essence of ideas and concepts in the beginning .
The class required me to understand these abstract ideas like balacing chemcal equations or figuring out proper atomic masses .
First , I was entirely lost and unable to learn how to solve these problems because I just could not understance the concept of it .
The teacher tried to help me out by re-explaning these thoughts and ideas over and over again , and I still needed more help .
Then , it was factual examples which really helped me to get these .
By looking at how the teacher and my friends solving these problems , I just learned what to do when problems approach to me .
I immitated their ways of solving problems , and I was able to solve any chemistry problem on my own .
This really made me think that learning factual process is as important as understanding the concept .

Thus , it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .
Of course , ideas and concepts are ultimate goals the students to achieve in school .
However , before they try to reach it , they really should learn factual informations enough first .
In that way , The students will feel much easier to understand the concepts .
Therefore , learning facts in firsthand is more important than understanding ideas for students .
