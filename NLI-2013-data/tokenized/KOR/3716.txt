Most of adults tend to criticize the young people for their not taking time to help the local communities .
They insist that most young people these days only focus on their own life , taking individualism as the most important thing .
And also adults are urging young people to get out of thier own lives and try to help the others who are suffering from economical or emotional problems in their community .
And then , according to what the adults say , young people like us have to take a full responsibility for that ?
No , I do n't think so .

There are so many young people who are willing to help others in the local community .
But the problem is that they do n't have enough time to look around and help distressed people and bad circumstances .
Recent survey on the empolyment rate of college graduates showed that only half of them have been employed .
That 's mainly because while the companies are provinding much less jobs , the potential applicants have been increased greatly .
That means that the competition for seeking jobs became much severe and they have to invest enourmous amounts of time getting qualified to work for the companies .
Qualifications for getting permitted to the company are becoming more and more strict as time passes .
As a result , it 's almost impossible for young people to take time serving their communities .

Secondly , as current society is being westernized so much compared to the past decades , the concept of `` community '' became vague .
Few people are well aware of what the community means to them , which means they do n't feel like they have to serve the community .
Current society is not community-centered any more but each home-centered .
Modern people have a tendency to only focus on their family and relatives .
That is , these social concept change on the community is one of the main reasons that young people these days do n't give enough time to helping community .
In this point they ca n't be blamed for that .

It does n't make sense to only criticize the young people for not helping their community .
There are other factors that young people can not control for themselves .
Instead of blaming them only based on their behaviors , social structure which can encourage young people to take their time to help the communities have to be established first .
