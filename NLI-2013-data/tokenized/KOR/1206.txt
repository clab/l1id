When I was a graduate school student , some undergraduated student asked that it was good for him to go to graduate school or not .
At that time I answered that out society requires specialized people , so you should go to graduate school .

First of all , most of companies and schools like specialist .
For example , I joined this company for my special ability about computing special algorithm and hardware information .
But my manager said to me that the reason why I was accepted was my special ability to develop new programs .
And so on I had favoralbe characteristics about developing programs .
In my opinion the special characteristics is also personal special ability .

Secondly , specializing evokes evolution .
For instance a lot of professors and scientists had a lot of theories after they consumed their own whole life at their taeget or result .
My professor spended his whole time to modeling about electrochemical etching and finite element method .
Now he is very famous at modeling and he wrote some books about revised his theory and method .
And my father was a engineer in mechanics .
He spended his whole time to make a new machine to make a speical register .
He made finally that machine and he got a lot of momey .

I heard that most recruiters wanted various experienced students or engineers .
However , I want to say that special ability is the prerequisite or premis to get a new job .
My friends did not have their jobs after graduation .
So they tried their special ability about learning foreign language , special engineering course work , and how to introduce themselves to recruiters .
After those courses which took two or three months , they had their job successfully .

In conclusion , special knowledge is more important that broad knowledge in modern society .
Because our society requires specialist , and specialists can make a lot of money in future .
So most of students will try to be a specialists .
