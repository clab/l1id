I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
Because scientists are researching a wide range of new transfortations .
Now , humakind face the cricis of energe lack , so we need to invent new alternative .
If they invent environmental trasportation , the number of cars will decline .

As a result , I agree that cars in use will be fewer and fewer .
