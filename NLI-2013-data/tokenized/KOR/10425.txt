I agree about this topic .
Most people want to acheive what they are doing .
And they do n't satisfy about that .
They continue to try new things and they wants more things .
For example , in my country we have `` Samsung '' company .
And it is biggest company in my country .
They are trying a lot of things even they are the biggest campany in the country .
Today another countries use samsung compant too .
This campany is already international company .
But , they are continue trying for another things .
I think this become to be biggest company .

If people already got a successful life , so they stop what are they doing .
Then another people will break things and be higher .
For example , I know a one preson like this case .
He regent about things .
And trying to be a better life .
But it is hard to built that he made .

Everybody have to try new things , and do hard about what they have .
I think people have to be more polite when they have a successful life .
And have to work hard .
Human do n't satisfy about one things .
In my case I do n't satisfy one thing that I did successfuly .
I find new things and I want to achieve that successfully .
Even the animals do something successfully they find another things to do .
And they wants better life than before .
Everybody in the world wants successful life and they wil continue to try new things .
For this reason we are living better life than before .
If they did n't try new things , than our life will not be different 200 years ago and now .

Therfor , in my opinion I agree about this topic .
And I will also continue to try new things .
