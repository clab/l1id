The question asks about tecqnology .
In my opinion academic subjectsis better to have borad knowledhge than specialize in one specific subject .
There are severl reasons shows at the bottom , why i disagree .

First , the world is developing really fast .
A centry ago people thinks specific subject is more important than acadamic subjects .
Also number of people still thinks specific subjuct is more important than academic subject .
I would say that is wrong .
If you have job like writer , musical job , artist or Singer that migt better to have broad knowledge of may specific subject .
But the world is developing really fast people need to follow the tecqnology .
There are how to learn many academic subject .
School in one of good case .
Most of high school in korean which I was from , learn more mathemathic , physics , chemistry , Biology or computer .
I believe the school is better to learn knowledge than others .

Second , I will give a different example about Korea Korea has good IT tecqnology .
So most of people working in computer part or science part .
There are severl example about academic knowledge .
The company needs employees also the employee have to have enough knoledge .
In case I have a computer company .
I need a 5 people need to work in my factory which makes CPU .
Most of people knows what is CPU some are not .
People call CUP is the brain in computer which means it is the most important part in computer .
So I need to make the most important part , need to find people learned about ' how to make CPU ' .
Before learn that subject they need a lot of information about compter , that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing .
Go to far , Unibersity or colloage .
Good Unibersity or colloage need high grade .
Most of course in high schools are academic subjects .

World is developing people need to follow that other ways we can not developing more and more .
What I am saying now is the learning .
In the learning I am saying ` Academic Subjects'
