Today , there are many different kind of the car in the word for different reasons .
One might be that people like different style of the cars and the other might be that people created that for different reasons .
For example , the company which based on selling their car will produce nice out looking car , which does not mean their car has clear system .
On the other hand , there are some company which based on producing less polluted cars .
Which do you thing will increase ?
What I strongly believe in twenty years is that even though there are many projects to keep our environment clean from the gas from the car , there is no decrease of the car uses because people wants the nice car and it actually gives great opportunities to live in out fast moving world in order to being a successful man/women .

First , people 's desire to the car will not stop at all .
Of course there must be some people who try not to use the car but problem is there are not enought people to make uses of the car decrease .
In fact , every single family has at least one or two cars and moreover , there are numerous people who collects the cars . !
Do you think it is possible to make them not to collect ?
The basic reason why people keep collects new cars is it gives sufficient feeling to have the full feeling .
The answer is , obviously , no .
So , it is impossible to decrease the number of cars in the world .

Because of it 's usefull facts , easy and comfortable to go other place , people will more and more use the cars .
People can not follow our fast-pace life without the cars .
Since our world has been developed very well , in fact , the number of people who works at the job like business where people continuosly move to different place are continuosly increasing .
Be more specifically , since people want to do something as fast as they want , car provides valuable fact , especially time saving .
Time saving is one of the most important skills in our life in order to be success .

Even though some people try not to use their car , it does not means our environment will be clear .
For decreasing car uses , there must be some sort or movement of the government under the law .
However , what make me to disagree is that if I see the statement from now , it is impossible that there will be fewer car uses in twenty years .
