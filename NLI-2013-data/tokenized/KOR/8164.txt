Different from past , these days , because of developed science techniqe , usually students study very hard and they can learn many things .
Although idea and concept are efffective for students , before recongnized facts , they ca n't learn exactly about that .

Hence I strenthly disagree that statement .

First , if we are learn or study for something , we have to know facts .
Because before recognize facts , we ca n't understand that and we ca n't make ideas or concepts .
There are many subjects in the studay , math , English , science , music , fine art , and so on .
For example , in music and fine art case we do n't have to learn many thing , However we ca n't think or make idea or concept without basic facts .
Especially , in science and math case we have to learn basic fact .
Moreover we do n't need to use science and math .
There are calculate and fact .

Second , after graduate school , usually we attend company .
So we have to learn many things in school .
But if we learn method of make idea or concept and graduate school , we ca n't live without fact in society , especially company .
We ca n't work with only idea and concept .
Money is very important at companies .
But if we got idea and concept more than fact in school we ca n't alive at company .
It is impossible .
Of course , before got facts we could think idea and concept , but if we use idea more than facts , we can homless .

Facts is vety important everything .
These days , it is getting important .
Without learn fact in school we ca n't develop ourselves .
So I disagree
