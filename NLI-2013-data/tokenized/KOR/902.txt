Some university teach the student with broad knowledge of many academic subjects and others concentrate on specific subject .
In my opinon , if I can choose , I would rather study one specific subject .

Fisrt , I can study deeper in same amont of time .
If I have more knowlege in one subject I can use it more .
Also I think if I had the experience study deep enough in one subject , studying other sbuject is much easier than before .
However , if I never had that experience I can only go as far as the first subject with the second subject or hard to study deeper because I do not have experience .

Second , these days , the company wants the people who has a great knowledge about one specific subject .
In our socity we work togeather .
Most of the company has parts of the work and expected them to do their own job not the other persons job .
If each of the employees can finish their job perfectly there will be no problem of the soving the task .

Last , you can share the information about what you know well .
If there is an issue that need to discuss about your major , you can explain to other people because you know it well .
However you know it vaguelly the information that you would explain would not helpfull , in worst situation that could give more confusion to the people who are listening to your explanation .

As I talk about the advantages of leaning a specific subject , I support the idea .
I want to have one specific knowledge and I think it helps me and the socity at the same time .
