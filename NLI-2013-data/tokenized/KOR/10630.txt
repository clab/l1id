Did you read about `` 7 habits of high success people '' wtitten by Steven Covey .
I was 18 years old , I read it .
It was so good for me .
My major is accounting and bussiness management .
So that books is the most important book .

Right now , many people try new things , and some people will be fail , or some people will be great success .
I think , I agree this statement , because , I believe that proverb `` When you sow , and if you reap '' This provers is the true .

For example , If you are a C E O of the big company .
and your company is the third grade of the customer .
Even , your company is getting down of custome favorites , In this situation , If are you staying that spot ?
may be not , If you try new things , even you havu take risks sourse .

Many bussiness people avoid change .
Because they do not like the lisk .
Right , anybody does not like the lisk .
Also my mother too .
my mom has a coffee shop in korea .
Coffee shop is very good income .

But , It is not still forever .
3 months later another coffee shop is opened .
and they was compititied .
so my mom try new things , For example , my mom bought the waffel constructure .
This is very expensive .
some people told that `` Do not take the waffle , coffee is enough '' However mom mind is not change , and than seccess .

I think many people fear to fail .
also me too .
but `` When you saw , if you reap '' so try , and try new things .
Later you secce
