Some people think that to study many academic subjects for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject .
However , I do not agree the opinion and think that people getting a specialized knowledge will be beneficial to our society as follow reasons .

To begin with , our society , recently , should get the human resources getting a specialized knowledge in many areas such as technology , economy and policy .
Because unprofessional people can lead the society - country , company , party etc. - to the miserable status .
The negative results of companies operated by unprofessional owners can be a good sample .
For example the Korean famous corporation ` Daewoo ' got the bankruptcy some years ago , because the owner ignore the advice of professional staffs .

At seccondly , the modern society has expanded its area .
So the society has been detailed and needs the people suitable for each area .
Especially , the modern corporations have so much departments for improving the efficiency .
For example , most companies divede the department such as administration , accounting , human resources , general support and production .

In this case , companies should employee people who can use the specialized knowledge .

At third , if necessary , there are other ways to grow broad knowledge after becoming the specialist in specific area .
The community activity and interaction with people in other area will be effective way .
So many companies hire specialists and give them opportunities to experience other area for growing people who are able to control the overal companies

In conclusion , I cannot agree that to study many academic subjects for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject , considering the above reasons .
