Although some may assert that knowing the facts is the most important thing when studying , I believe that it is much beneficial for students to actually understand the ideas and concepts for their better studies .

To begin , it would be much time-saving for children to grasp the concept before studying the facts of the subject .
If they memorize the facts initially and then try to understand the ideas , it would take them more time to obtain all the knowledge in that area .
Since people usually forget the facts they memorized , after going through the concepts of the study they are working on .
For instance , if I memorize the terms used in water circulation and then try to understand the concept of it , I would have to go over the words again , since I have to fit my knowledge into what I have learned right now .
While understanding the ideas in the first place can make me only fit the terms in to what I have already done understanding .

On top of that , it would make the study much easier to know the concepts first .
When one understand the thins and then learn the facts related in it , it comes to person 's mind in more influential way .
The study of math can be a good example .
If a child in a kindergarten learns that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' , they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' but do not actually understand the term of plus .
While , if they initially learn what plus actually means , then they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' and ` 3 plus 2 is 5 ' and so on .
By understading the idea of something , it leads people to learn in more efficient way .

By grasping the concept of the subject , one can save their time and effort .
All in All , I believe that learning ideas and concepts of something in the first place is much benefitable and profitable for the people to actully learn and study a subject .
