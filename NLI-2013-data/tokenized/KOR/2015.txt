I do n't agree that 's true .
Young people are just trying to enjoy their lives .
They can not enjoy their lives easily .
They olny enjoy a little in their freetime .
There are a few reasons why they do n't enjoy good enough .
First , they have a lot to do .
They have to study more and more .
They have to go school for their future .
If they do n't study , they ca n't get the garranty for the future .
A lot of new knowlodge come up to the world everyday .
If they want to win the compititions , they have to study more and more .
That 's the way to survive .

Second , they do not have enough money to enjoy .
In generally when they want to do something fun , they need money .
If they travel their country , they need money .
Whatever they want to do , they need money , except the part-time jobs they want .

The last reason is the tons of items to enjoy .
Now they have a lot of things to have fun .
Some young poeple get confused among them .
They do not even know what and how to enjoy .
The floods of things to enjoy can make them hesitate what to choose .

If so , can older people enjoy their lives well ?
My answer is `` Yes '' There are some reasons to say that .
First , older people have enough time to enjoy .
If they retire from their jobs , they can do .
They do not spend their pretty much time to prepare fot the future .
They can just only enjoy their lives .
Second , they have money .
When they retire , they get some money from their company , or they can recieve money even from reverse mortagage .

In conclusion , older people can enjoy their lives more comforble and easily than young people .
