I disagree this question .
A lot of people want success thieir life .
but success people do n't afraid new advantage .
Here is one example .
you know Walt Elias DIsney ?
When he built movie company , he need new creat something .
Actually when he built movie company , nobody recommand what he built company .
but he did .
Then he lack money .
He was really poor .
So he wanted earned money .
But trying to make a new movie is very risk thing to him .
However he never give up .
Because he had dream .
He always said `` If you dream it , you can do it ! ''
And he got a idea from mice .
He confirmed his business .
So he lend money from his brother .
At first his brother do n't want borrow money to him .
Because if he fail , he lose money .

However he beilieve Disney 's dream .
At last , Disney made mouse character .
That was `` Mickey Mouse '' After he made Mickey Mouse , he became a rich .
That means trying to risk idea with dream , never reget .
Also here is another example .
I 'm exchange student .
At first , when I said to my parents `` I want to try exchage student program '' , my parents disagree .
However I had dream .
At last I started my risk advantage .
Actually I was afraid .
Afraid of English , make friends , adjust new country , etc .
I did .
I overcome my afraind .
Trying to risk is nothing .
If you have brave and confidence , I recommend try new thing .
I think really poor act is afraid of fail .
You know what ?
We grow by fail .
Also fail give good lesson for success .
These days , successful people try new things .
Lots of business man try to new business for thier dream .
Also I will try new things .
Even if that is very risk .
I will try again and again for my dream .
So I disagree with following statement .
