People , especially those who would like to make a succees in their life , discuss about whether they always try to find new things and get the risk or just still staying what they already have a knowledge to make a better life .
I strongly believe that those who succeed in their life must take a risk and try to get new things because in the age of information , the spirit of exploitation and pioneer is necessary and stability means bake to the era .

Firtly , successful people always have a good spirit of fronteer to exploit their life .
For example , the SamSung company which is specialized in electronic field such as TV , computers and semiconduct product worldwidely has been researched new market and toe-notched products at everymoment as a result , it has been able to get a great reputation in the world market and people .
If the company still enjoyed the stability , today 's successful story would not be existed .
Further more , the company which exploit the well of crude oil always try to fine a new resources with investing agreat amount of money with huge risk .
For these efforts , it deserved to get much reputation and accumulate the fortune .

Secondly , stability of today 's life means back to the past in this capitalism .
Everyday , new information is revealed to the public and every individual must have a radar to catch it .
For example , the auto maker company try to new desing to meet the customers ' need in the market , however the do not mke an effort to make a new design of cars , the company will lose the people 's consumption .
By doing so , new investment and new design should be tried to keep the reputation and successful story .
In addition , if a member of computer program company has knowledge old version , he will be lose his job and even previous skill .

For these reasons , I strongly believe that people want be successful life , they must have a sense of challenge and must realize the stability of today 's life will ruin them in the modern society .
In order to succeed , we should review the international successfully company ' st .
