When people imagine about young people 's lives , they think active and joyful lives , so I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people usually tend to try something new .
In other words , they feel excited about an event that they have never experienced before no matter how hard it is .
However , majority of older people do not want to try something fresh because they already feel comfortable with their ordinary life .
Even though they are bored with their circumstances , they normally do not have desire for more interesting life .
Last christmas , I met my grandmother .
When I suggested going on a trip to wherever she wants to go , she seemed she was not enthusiastic about the plan , obviously contrary to me , so I asked her the reason for her feeling .
Then , she said that she felt exhausted enough and all she wanted to stay at home rather than travel .
At that moment , I could realize all the seniors like my grandmother desire more comfort and rest .

The other reason is that young people are provided much more experiences from the society .
For example , when teenagers graduate from their high schools , they eventually enter the university .
And , in the university , there are plenty of clubs that they can get involved .
Thus , through variety of clubs they experience , they can find their intersts and feel pleased .
Older people , on the other hand , do not receive many opportunities from their circumstances because they usually stay at home or go only several places where they use to go daily .
Although these places can provide them convenience , they cannot give them a chance to try various kind of activities .
Therefore , the older people undergo much less experience than young people .

As a result , the young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people try to find something new and they experience variety of opportunities more than older people do .
