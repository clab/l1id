In this rapidly changing world , we always face new things every single morning .
Some peole think cars are most revolutionary device the human have ever made so thus in the future these will be used widely .
In my opinion , however , I strongly believe that there will be other thing that we can use instead of cars in the the future .

First of all , technology people are exploring plays key role in developing new devices .
this is largely because technology will create trasporting machines that are more convenient and time saving .
To illustrate this point , when I younger , I read a cartoon which has been famouse , Dragon ball .
In this cartoon , there was a device that flys , but not a airplane .
This made them go the place where they want go faster .
I am sure that there will be a this kind of devices in the future .

On top of that , the cars used by people now will be gone .
Due to their danger and harmful effects on both nature and human , these will be replaced in a certain moment like its introduction .
According to the oe specific reseach conducted by some universities , people have a tendency to avoid cars for their transporting devices these days because they make lots of accidents resulting in death as well as they destroy both human and nature by making harmful gases .
This shows that the cars will be replaced in the future .

To conclude , I firmly believe that cars will be gone and replaced in the future because new technology will make new and convenient machine and they cause critical problems to human and nature .
All il all , I think one 's creativity can do everthing that one imagine .
