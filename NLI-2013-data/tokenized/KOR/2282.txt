It is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Some people think that young people are more enjoyable that older people because they have more strong body to enjoy life .
However , I strongly believed that older people enjoy their life for the following two reasons ; they have a lot of time and money , they have less responsibilityfor the society .

To begin with , older people are more live than only three decades before .
They have more chance to attend an activities .
Also , they have a lot of time and money rather than young people .
It will be a great opportunity for older people to enjoy life .
For example , lots of activities center such as YMCA are crowded of older people .
They get together in that place and learning other activities such as ballet , yoga , swimming and card game .
Also they are spend a lot of money to travel abroad .
Since they had no time when they were young because they focused on their own jobs .
They might be a less opportunity to travel abroad .
Dong-a , mosr popular travel company in Korea , shows the evidence .
In 2005 , traveling abroad older people are two times that young people .
The criterion was over 60 ages .
Thus , older people are usually enjoy their life .

On top of that , older people have less responsibility in their children and society .
That is because almost they are not working reguarly and their children are growed .
This means older people have less responsibility that young people .
For example , I can see my grandmother who enjoy her own life .
She is a important role in her community , getting together for friendship , and she has lots of clubs such as golf , dace and music .
I this she really enjoys her life after working in a public department .
She had been working for a public dapartment fo 30 years .
At that time she never had a opportunities to enjoy her life .
However , recently she seems too young better than my mother .
Thus , older people have less responsibilities of society and their chidlren , so they can enjoy their life .

In summary , I strongly belive with the statements that older people are enjoy their life .
That is because they have more money and time better that young people .
Also they have less responsibilities of society and their children .
