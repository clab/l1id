I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than nowadays .
Reasons for this opinion is as mentioned below .

To begin with , traffic problem is already reached its peak .
As a Korean dwelling in the city of Seoul , I always have problems to find an empty parking lot when I drive out in the city .
Similar to myself , many people living in Seoul does not use their cars if it is not really necessary because of parking problems and traffic jams .
Moreover , these phenomenons are getting worse .
Also , since more and more population are concentraing into major cities including Seoul , there will be less cars .

Secondly , the metropolitan cities are setting up the plan to establish more and more natural parks in the city areas that there no-car areas and streets are increasing .
It is expected , in Seoul area , that there will be so many sections that prohibits the access of vehicles after twenty years , it will not be efficient or comfortable to drive cars in the city areas .
For example , one of the plan of the mayor of the city government of Seoul , newly elected , is to convert the Yongsan U.S. military compound into a natural park .
He is even planing one of the bridges to be walk-only bridge to let people feel the natural environment of Han river .
Thus , using cars will be decreased because of its inefficiency .

Thirdly , development of public transportation is magnificent nowadays .
In Seoul , there have been influx of cars for last 20-30 years , but nowadays , many citizens use public transportations including buses and expecially subways .
There are 12 lines of subways in Seoul that you can reach to almost any place in and out of the city .
Since the cost of petroleum is ever growing , using buses and subways are becoming much faster and cheap .

In sum , it is expected that there will be fewere cars in use in twenty years .
This assertion is on the bases of the reasons taht serious traffic jams , growing areas of car-prohibition and efficiency of public transportations .
