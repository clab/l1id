In nowdays , traveling become easy cause of inventions of transportation system such as aircraft , automobile and high-speed train .
So , many people travel led by a our gudide because of ease to travel and book the hotel and transportation .
However , I disagree with traveling by a tour guide .
Before , criticizing travel by tour guide , This essay will discuss about pros and cons of travel by tour guide .

Travel by tour guide have some benefit to begineers to travel .
Begineers has no information about where , when , and how to hang aboung specified cities .
When I was traveling around Shanghai PROC , I had to travel to use a tour guide .
I had no information to use mass-transportation .
However , I could't find the exictement of travel .
Because , traveling cites was just famous sight .

The reason why I do n't support using a tour guide in two ways .
First , using a tour guide is not good way to see what the people do and live .
When I was traveling around Beijing , I do n't decide to use a tour guide rather than travel myself .
It was hard time to travel .
However everytime to try to travel , I could find some people to help me .
I could see the markets where the people 's breath .
Second , traveling alone can provide free time to think , comparing to travel with a tour guide .
With tour guide , I only follow the schdule what he provided .
So , It is n't possible to find out the thought time .
However , traveling alone is possible to think the emotion where I traveled .

There are pros and cons to travel by alone or group .
In a group led by a tour guide would provied some excitement .
However , It is better to travel alone who tastes the real excitement .
