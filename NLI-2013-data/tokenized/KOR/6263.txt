When I first came to Sri Lanka , in 1993 , there were hardly any cars .
Instead , buses , trains and tuk-tuks were ideal modes of transport at that time .
There were lots of bikers in the streets as well where some would be selling icecreams or simply be on his way to work .

After living five years , my father had taken few years off his work .
Together as a family , we emigrated to Edinburgh for couple of years .
I was around 15 , when I was back in Sri Lanka .

Everthing was different .

Yes , I could still see the tuk-tuks and the buses in the streets .
However , bikers where some used to sell icecream or bread , had completely disappeared .
Instead , there were millions of cars .
Known for having wild driving style in Sri Lanka , moments spent on the road were n't very safe as it used to be .
More traffic , more accidents .

Currently , the situation has gotten much worse .
Where it used to be just 15 minutes from school to home , it is now 45 .
Of course , it varies on different time of the day , but however the fact is that the number of cars have certainly increased .

I cannot see why that will not be the case 20 years from today .
The situation will only be changed , if there were an alternative mode of transport which will offer the same advantages offered by a car .
For example , convinience , availabilty and comfort .
Trains , nor buses can neither fully satisfy the demands of the people .

Unless there is a superior advancement in transport , I believe cars will hold dominance over all other modes .
