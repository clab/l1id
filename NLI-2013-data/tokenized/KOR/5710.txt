Have you ever bought any items that you do n't have serious need to use ?
If you have experienced this case , It is because of a drastic advertisement .
People who live in modern world are members of capitalistic societies .
An advertimest has a role of making consumers buy its product .
So , I think that advertisements usually make people overestimate the prices of products .
It is because of the purpose of advertisements , the models of advertisements , and the indirect feature of advertisements .

First of all , I think the purpose of advertisements is the important reason to make people misjudge products .
The roles of advertisments are to urge consumer to buy everything the companies sell .
In order to fulfill their goals , companies is going to whatever they can do .
Therefore , most companies merely want to emphasize the good aspect of their products .
As a result , products look better than they pratically are .

Secondly , I believe that the models of advertisements make products look much better .
Usually , most advertisements tend to hire famous stars , sport players , and any super stars as their models .
People can believe whatever super stars say in advertisements because super starts so famous that people regard them as reliable humans .
So , Using super stars for advertisements is another reason for overestimating .

Thirdly , It is obvious that people ca n't esimate any products directly by advertisements .
Through any advertisements , everything look good all the time .
However , all aspects of the products are indirect experiences .
People ca n't touch , use , smell , hold and even see directly through any advertisements .
Therefore , it makes products look better to consumers .

Most people live in capitalistic society .
Every company wants to make consumer buy their items by its advertisement .
because of the purpose of its , the models , and indirect feature of a advertiment , people can overestimate the qualities of products .
