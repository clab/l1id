Do you always succeed to buy a something though it 's advertisement ?
Some people think that advertisement always convey real aspects of their products because consumer can be know after buying the products .
However , I agree with the idea that real products could be defferent from the advertisements in that advertisements have a limited time to attract consumer and we can misunderstanding about that .

The main reaon why I think that real products are more disappointable than that of advertisements is that companies want to make their advertisements more attractively because they do not have enough time to provide information about their products .
For example , when a new car is intoduced in the market , the car company make the advertisement very attractively because they should allure a lot of customer as possible .
However , they can not explain all advantages of the car .
In that reason , most advertisements are made much better than real .

Furthermore , when we see advertisements , somtimes we can misunderstanding about the products .
Seeing a real product is very different from just watching television advertisement or seeing the paper advertisements because we might see the colors differently or understand the function differently .
For example , when I bought a new computer , I disappointed about the real product because the color and size are different than I expected .
I wanted black color and small size computer , but the real product was grey color and bigger size .

In conclusion , most advertisements want to make people attract and we can misunderstand the advertise
