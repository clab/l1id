I most certainly agree the idea that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I want to defing enjoying life as how much passoin they have in their life and the example of hign school student in Korea and America varify the statement .

First of all , Korean students know how to spend their life through participating many works , demonstraing that Korean teenagers try to challenge and move than older people .
When older people try to stay what they do , students want to move around places to experience as many as possible to learn about other culture and what to improve for themselves .
Also , I want to show you example when they finish their final exam .
They study all the time after school and prepare for the final exam .
So after the test , they do anything to solve their stress .
They go to computer room and spend all night and they sing song before they cannot sing , showing that how much passion they have in their life and know how to enjoy the life .

Second , I would like to introduce when I was in America .
One thing that I was surprised is about sports in their life .
American high school has three season for their sports and they try to prepare for it two month before the beginnig of their season .
They practice as hard as they can to defeat their opponents .
During the season , they sometimes rejoy to death when they win and even cry when they lose .
Through sports , they learn about life and try to win everytime by live hard as they can with passion .
However , adults in America is very inactive in their life .
Most of people try to earn easy money and spend it quickly .
They do not enjoy their job and feel very hard about their life .

As can be seen above , those who have passion in their lfe know how to enjoy life and spend it great .
I hope I enjoy my life even though I get old a
