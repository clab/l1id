Nobody knows how young people play more than older people ?
Even though young people can enjoy like an adult .
But , they ca n't completely like a old people .
They want to go to another place and they want to eat delicious food .
And they want to be an aduly .
But we ca n't help them .
Because , this world have rules .
Also we have to keep those rules .
But young people who is under 21 their law is smaller than adult 's low .
Therefore , they are freedom .
If young people have to strong of law , they cannot enjoy ther life .
Also I would like to come back childhood .
Just imagine !

If one family go to picnic or vacation , their children what are they doing ?
May be , they will play .
But their parents will work like a make a food or convey their carry .
Also , their parents have to spend a money .
Their parents need a money for a vacation .
That 's too bad .
Anyway , they have to make a money .
Their children use thier parents money .
Therefore , they enjoy their life more than older people do .

That was what I am thinking .
