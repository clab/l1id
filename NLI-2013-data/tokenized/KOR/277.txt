I agree withe the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
For three reasons .

The first reason why I agree is understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning the facts is according to my experience .
When I was 10th grade I hated math that is because I am not good at math .
I just memorized the facts but I did not know why the answer is .
But , when I was 11th grade , my math teacher said that I have to know the ideas and concepts to do well in the math .
From then , I did not memorized the facts , instead , I studied the ideas and concept .
After the few month , I became to do well in math .
According to my experience , I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important .

Second , to understand ideas and concepts we have to think long , patiently .
During this process we can learn the facts automatically and we will not forget the facts .
And during the process , to understand ideas and concepts , it will make us to think more flexibly .
And make us more logically .

And the last as we understand ideas and concepts we can understand the facts more .

Beacuse , understanding ideas and concepts may make us to think more flexibly and more logically , may we make us tounderstand the facts more and according to my experience I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
