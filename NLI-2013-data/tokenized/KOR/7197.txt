Today , a growing number of people that led by a tour guide , when they have a travel to the other nation .
leding by a tour guide has its advantages and disadvantages .
if it were up to me , i would definetedly choose to travel is in a group .
This is because of , the advantages of traveling in a group far outweigh the disadvantages of leding by a tour guide .
To give you an idea .
here is an example .

To start with , if we go to travel in a group .
we can get a lot of experience .
From my personal experience .
when i went to sanfransico with youth group which include in church .
We have to preparing for retreat to having a good time without a complain each together .
for example , We bought stuff like foods , lamps and maps and so on from that time .
through this experience , we can get a wisdom and good relationship .

furthermore , As time goes saying , `` Experience is best teacher . ''
As this example demonstrates , people probably do n't forget the lesson from the experience .
I have a friend who is bestfriend in korea .
when he had a free time from a company for a 1month .
he just woried about whether he should go in a his company group or leding by a tour guide .
finally , he choosed that go to travel by a tour guide .
he went to california .
actually you know there are a lot of beautiful place in here .
such as ` Laguna beach , seal beach , hill and so on ' but then , the tour guide lead to him and his family to disney land , and LA downtown , Korea downtown .
they got a frustrate that titely schedule which made him .
As we have seen , although they get a difficult physical , he should have go to travel with family in a company group To sum up , Given the between traveling is in a group and leding by a tour guide .
i would choose to first thing .
overall , the experience that i went to sanfransisco became part of my life .
I whole heartedly agree with the idea that going travel is in a group .
