I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Actually , both of them enjoy their life .
But , there is difference between young people and older people .
Older people does n't have much energy like young people .
They 've worked hardly for long time , and it 's possible that they already saw many good things , and had experiences before .
Therefore , they 'll not be interested in doing or enjoying many things .
Some old people really enjoy their life , but I think youung people can enjoy more than older people .

For example , many old couple has traveling to some other countries because their son or daughter bought the ticket or tour plan for them .
After the son got grew up , and when they can make money , and they can make some nice plan for parents .
Because parents worked hardly for family .
However , parents really ca n't enjoy the tour .
The travel has busy schedule , and they need to walk a lot .
So , it can be a little bit tough for old people if somebody is not healthy enought to do .
I saw many times when I had traveling .
Whenever we walked to new place , they sometimes said they did n't want to go because they 're are already exhausted from another place .
Maybe , they can enjoy different things with different style .
However , I do n't think they can enjoy like young people .
I thought about that before , and actually , I hope I can travel to many other countries when I 'm younger .
Even though I do n't have enough money , but I think it 's good idea to try it .
I have different view with older people .
And , I can see many new things , and can learn .
There are some places that older people does n't go or are not allowed for entrance .
I want to have much more experience before getting older .
Of course , I can enjoy my life when I 'm older , too .
However , in my opinion is young people has more variety of chances to enjoy different things , and more activities because they have more energy to try everything .
After the time passes , it wo n't come back again .
So , I really think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
