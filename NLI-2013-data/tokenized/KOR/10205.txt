I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
One reason is that it motivate other poeples creating new product .
For example , if sucessful invent new products and it earn much money , it would be motivated other people to invent more useful thing than fomer thing which made by successful people made .
So it make consumers use more useful things .

Second reason is that It is very holic In my case When I took a math problems or other problems but I solved myself it 's so exciting that I want to feel it again .
I think it is same about try new things and take risks .
I know how excited it is about inventing or producing new things which noone invent or produce it .
Also it bring not only much money but also respects other peoples .

Finally , if they no more try new thing it makes me lazy .
I saw many times that if someone who invent new thing but no more try , finally he disrupted and divorced .
