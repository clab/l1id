I agree with that statemant .
I believe that human 's mind control and power .
Strong mind can make do something difficult from the person .
Successful people always have a positive mind and strong mind .
It is very important to people .
So , they are not afraid adventure .
It makes try new things to successful people .
successful people know how to can be success .
For example , i heard one story .
It is story who a rich person .
The rich man belive that he is going to die 50 years old .
And he decided to spend his all money untill his death .
The rich man was ca n't stop his spend money .
When his age becam 50 years old .
he was still alive .
but he already became poor person .
suddenly the rich man became homeless .
he realized about his past days .
And he started again work at 50 years old .
When he was 70 year old , we was rich man again .
He 's real life is started from 50 years old .
When i heard that story , i so suprised .
However , that story make me realized that successful is depend on person 's mind .
And Who once expirenced to success know how to do well .
As such reason , i support that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing wtat they already know how to do well .
