One of the factor that the successful people have is their eagerness to challenge and try new things in order to advance themselves .
Even though it might seem safe to stay where one is , and stay inside of the box of self-satisfaction , I believe challenging is the key to make oneself better and more valuable .
From adage , my own , and sombody else 's experiences , my belief towards challenging can be supported .

One said , `` The greatest sin that the young can commit is to become ordinary . ''
To be the same with the others will not make one more successful .
The eagerness and enthusiasm to become unique and different from others are what can inspire one to be more valuable .
This adage has been my motto since I decided to come to United States to pursue my dream , and it was what motivated me to pursue career of filmmaking instead of being lawyer or doctor which are the career favored by most fellows around me .

Challenge in the field of filmmaking took very significant role and led me to make movie with higher quality .
One day , I was trasferring the movie I filmed to my computer .
Then I realized that the quality of my movies were very low compared to the movies in theater or in TV .
Then I realize that the cable and the receiving system in my computer were too antiquated .
I fell into dillema .
I had to pay much money to renew the system , and had to take a risk that it might not work with my camera .
However , I bought a cable , and rebuild the receiving station of the computer , and it turned out very successful ; the quality of the film was amazingly ameliorated and I was very satisfied .
From the experience of my own , I learned that I always had to challenge or I will be antiquated .

In business , being creative , and different is the key to be successful .
One of the renown entrepreneur , Howard Hughes was very challenging person .
He , who made a lot of money from oil business , turned his interest to movie business , and made movie `` Hell 's Angels '' , which was considered gigantic in scale of budget or size .
His entusiasm was never stopped and was continued to airplane , and he became one of the most successful person in business .

Even though , taking risk and challenging might look very dangerousm and reckless , trying new thing and enhancing oneself to better value was what makes people , such as Howard Hughes or me , to be passionate and eventually successful .
Therefore , I believe that trying new things and never staying satisfied are what could make people more valuable and more successful .
