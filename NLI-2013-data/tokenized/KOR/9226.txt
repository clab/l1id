At the learning process wherever at school or homestudy , it is importand to teach students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Most students do n't like study math .
Because students are used to study by fact .
There is no active reaction during the class .
The teachers write down the Roman numerals on the board and force students to memorize that There is no make sence why students should learn all about these kind of complicate questions .
However , if they would have known , math is need when they have plan to get morgage for thier future house or to calculate the discount of the purchases at the store , it will be motivate to them to learnd math .

As a student who study music composition , I have a class to write a fugue like Bach style .
When I have a list of all the stuff of writing such as canon , imitation and inversion .
I was so frustrated .
Because those stuffs are not music , that is just fact which bach inventer to me .
It does n't give any challenge .
After the class .
I go to library to find the real concept of writing a fugue .
It is german word ; means one follows another or one trys to escape the direction from the other .
It was understandable and give a mitivation to write a fugue .
Why does n't fugue teacher explain the concept of the fugue ?
Student want to know about the understand ideas more than the fact .

Learning has to be full of will and purpose with a pleasure in student 's mind .
The pleasure of learning came from knowing the ideas and concept .
The fact is less important than that .
