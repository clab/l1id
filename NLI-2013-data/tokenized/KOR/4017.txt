For me , as I am one of the young people according to nowadays , I belive that we do give enough time helping our community .
I would like to introduce our works for our community .

In school we are asked to do voluntiering work for an exact amount of time .
According to my knowledge I believe every school has the same amount of time to do voluntiering work .
Our school has to do more than 20 hours of voluntiering work for 3 years of junior-high school .
This may feel that we are foreced to do it , but even though we are forced to do voluntiering , I say we eventually help out community .

Young people nowadays do n't only spend time helping their commintity but also spend alot amount of time helping their country .
Korea is a small country with no fossile fules or what so ever .
The only resource that can help Korea to keep on going to the top would be students or young people intelligence .
A few days ago I found out that not even Japanese students study as hard as we do .
What I also knew was that Korea 's students had high grades in math and science than other country students .
Many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now .
The result to this , many parents of Korea 's young people are making their children to work harder than any bodyelse .
for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on .

According to my thought , I think young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities .
Although helping by voluntiering which is forced to do from school , I believe young people do realize they are helping out their community .
For a small country without any natural resorce like Korea , young people are studying harder than any other student in the world to eventually help thier country .
