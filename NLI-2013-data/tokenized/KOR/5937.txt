It is generally believed that after twenty years , there will be fewer cars than today .
Although many people think that cars are getting more decreased , in my opinion , cars will be much more increased in twenty years .

Above all , nowdays people want to live more convenient .
people would like to save their time and money .
so they may be want to their own cars .
For example , if they have their cars , they will save their time and they can go everywhere they want .
Cars will become most important things in people 's lives .
Then the demands for buying the car will be increasing .
For exampl , nowdays one house has more than one car .
Because they want to move individually , so they just get one 's car .
In this sense , people need cars imperatively to do live more conveniently in individualize society .

In addition , recently our technologies have developed continuously .
All over the world , they try to creat new and innovative things .
then we cannot stop their needs for making good and new things such as robots , machines and cars .
some scientists try to spread out the car whcih makes no pollution or use natural resources .
If we have that cars , we do not worry about the pollutions which can be bad effects about cars .
People who do not want to pollute environment will be enjoy their lives with their cars which make no pollution .
In this respect , if scientists study about the car which make no pollution and use natural resources and spread out all over the world , we will try to use the cars much more than use the public transportation .

In conlusion , I disagree that In twenty years there will be fewer cars than today for the reasons that I mentioned above .
To live much more convenient life and the development of technology influence on the increasing the cars after twenty years .
