I disagree with the statement because taking risks is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many years .
There are hundreds of companies I never heard of that were founded by a person took risks to make some money .
Even though it may sound easy , but it is very complicated : dealing with employments , monthly or yearly payments , government taxes , etc .
As the result , only a few companies or even no company will survive .
The result makes many people become moneyless or deptors .
Taking risks is not a good idea .

Trying is not a bad thing , but risking is not a good thing .
There are only a few people who succeeded by risking , while there are millions who unsucceeded by risking .
That 's why people who only does what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risks .
For example , early pioneers tried to make flying possible for humans .
Of course , the inventors succeeded , but the others lost money , wasted time , or even died .
But now billions of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplanes .
How did that happen ?
The manufacturing companies invented better airplanes , based on the early inventors ' designs .
In other words , they invented what they already knew how to do well .
Then the manufacturing company succeeded , selling thousands of the same model , for the same price , and ending what it 's like today .

There are many successful people who tried new things and took risks .
But there are more people who succeeded by not taking risks and only doing what they already know how to do well .
Like I mentioned earlier , taking risks could change people 's lives in a bad way by making them lose money , or even killing them .
But only doing what you already know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed .
