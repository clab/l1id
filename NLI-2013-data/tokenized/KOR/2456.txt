`` We should try everything as possible as many things before he become old . ''
My parents used to tell me since i was young .
It means that we can not do everything , which we want to do , when we become old , becasue old people can not have the power of life , eventhough they have exprienced knowledge and money .
I aagree with the following statement . ''
Young people enjoy life more than older peole do . ''

Firstly , when we are young , we have the important things for living our life , such as power of life and youngness .
Therefore , the two things can help us challeng and try everything in our life .
In the news , sometimes we could hear about news that young people challenge something incredible or accomplish something .
Few monthes age , i heard a news about handcapped group of peole challege to swim .
And they finally accomplished their goal , such as making short time records .
I believed that if we do not have the power of our life and youngness , we can out challenge and try to do everything .

Secondly , if we are young , we do not know abour fear .
if could make us enjoying life more than older people .
Usually , older people know fear of life well , becaseu they have much more expereices and hear about more happendings many times .
Thus older people know more fear about everything .
But , for young peole they are inexperienced about everything our life .
Thus young peole do not have much fear than older people .
We could see many examples world widely well , young people loves to try very wild and dangerous sports , such as sky diving and snow bording .
When i went ski and snow bording place , i could see the 95 percent of snow border was youg people , who want to feel the danger and speed .
Young people loves to feel fear and always want to challenge wildness in the world .

Lastly , eventhough older people usually have money , they can not evjoy their life than young people , becasue they think their future too much .
Older people think about their future , death , family and other suff alot , becasue they know their responsibilities .
But usually , for young people they do not think about theur future , job , family or other suff , becasue bascailly they have much time than older peole .
Young people could do their stuffs in their future , but for older people , they do nopt have much time , so they have to spend their time more valuably .
It always makes stoping older people enjoy their life .
For my personal example , just next my house , there is one family .
The family has old parents and two youg childrens .
Since last year , they all wanted to go travel every places in the world , the all family tried to go travel , but only their two children could go travel , becasue when they were living travel , parenst were start thinking anout their time , money , future , and everythings .
But their childrens did not thinkg about their suddroundings , and just decided to go travel , finally only their chidrlen could go travel .
Older peole can not enjoy their life , becasue they care about their surroudning problems too much , espeicially time .

In other words , young people enjoy life more than older people do , becasue young people have the power of life and youngness , these two things make them challenging .
Young people are unexperienced people , so they do not know the fear of life .
Thus sometimes , they could be very brave .
Lastly , everhtough older peole usually have much more money , h \ they can not enjoy life , becasue they care about their surrounging problems , such as time .
