I knew what communication means , it means that I have conversation with others and I should listen to others when they speak .
But sometimes I do n't listen to them , and just I talk to them what I want to say .
I still confused what I should do when I communicate with others , even though I know what it is .
I guess I do n't fully understand what is communication , but also I somehow misunderstand what it means .
In my opinion , understanding idea is more important than what it is .

I am pretty sure there are a lot of students like me .
Even though they know a lot of facts or definitions , they really do n't what it means for themselves .
So very often students could misunderstand what it is .
For exemple , even though I learn what is communication , I did n't try to understand that concept and I just admit this idea without thinking .
After all , it leads me to misunderstand what communication is and I could n't use this concept very well in my life .

I think all facts and definitions should be adapted to people .
If one does n't mean anything to them , it is really nothing .
It can become something when it is used by people and adapted for their life .
I learned a lot of things when I was young , but I could n't remember all those , such as Geology , Biology , Literature .
However I still remember what I need for my life and my career .
I still remember very well economics , math , English .
It is because I need latter more than former , not because former is not important .
If students find the meaning in what they learn , it is very helpful for their understanding .

For these two reasons , I believe that understanding is more important than what it is .
All people could learn what it is , but just some people could understand and use it for what they really need .
