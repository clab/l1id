Some people may think that the older people enjoy life more than young people do .
However in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because most of young people have a motivate to live and meet various people and hanging out with them make life more pleasant .

Young people have a dream .
I believe that it is really great to have a goal in our life .
Young people 's dreams are all different because of their fasinate desires such as ideal entertainers , parents , sportsmen , doctors , and artists .
Without this dreams , young people may live like a ` dead collapse ' .
For example , My friend longs to be a famous singer .
Therefore she practice her sing for more than 7 hours per day .
She does not want to give up her dreams because she loves to spend her time to singing .
She said when she practices the sing she feels like she is heaven .
I do not think that older people do not have a goal any more because they already achieved it and their rapid life will make them to live in boredom .

By meeting new people give young people an enjoyable life .
Everyday we approach new people .
It is really fun to meet them who have all different characteristics , and appearances .
When we meet someone who can reliable and want to be a companion to our lives then we called it `` Pursuit of happiness '' .
For instantce , when i hang out with all my friends , I forget depression and lost stress .
Some times we spent our time to watching movie , and chilling about our daily lives .
Even though we feel irritation because of our consistant boring life , it will be fine if we have a true friend .
At this time , i think i am not afraid of anything because always my friends being on my side .

In my conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because we have a dream where we can motivate ourselves , and hanging out with friends more often without any worries .
I am really happy to be part of young people ! .
