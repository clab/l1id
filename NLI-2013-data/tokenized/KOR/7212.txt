Nowadays , we sometimes go on a trip .
There are two methods to travel such as travelling by alone or group .
Some people assert that travelling in a group is not a perfect idea .
However I maintain that I can get various benefits to travel in a group : not expensive cost to travel and apportunity to share information .

First , I can enjoy traveling by cheap price .
Traveling costs is very high nowadays .
Because , if we go abroad , we could take an airplain .
However if I can go the travel in a group , we can save some money .
There are some rules that If taking it more than 10 people , airplain company would cut prices .
This situation is same as hotel and entrance fees .
For example , I went to Europe last summer in a group .
I went there during 15days and it was good aportunity for me .
On the other hand , one of my friend also went to Eurpople in same periods .
Eventohght we visited there same peiods and same date , we had a lot of differences in costs .
I only costed about 300 $ , but my friens costed 500 $ .

Second , I can get various information in travelling group .
Visiting other countries are advantures .
If you could have not visited at once , you would felt embarrased .
However you can enjoy clean , safe and informative travel in group .
For me , It was first time to go abroad .
So I felt scared sometimes .
Also I did not know what I was going to do .
At that time , I did not have enough information to enjou it .
By using travel agency , I could book airplains and hotels .
Also I could have a lot of information about Europe .
There were many people in that group , so it was available to contact them and share information and know-how which they recognized from travelling .

Eventhoug we should follow travel agency 's rule , I think it would be a good idea following in a group .
It would be a good apportunity to using small amout of money , to expand your experience as well as to get much information .
