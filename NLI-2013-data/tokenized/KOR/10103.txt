Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with the statement .

Sucessful people always try new things if they take risks .
Pesonally , they do n't care about risks and they are sick of their boring life , I suppose .

Among many reasons , the most important reason is that Successful people have an ambitious in their mind .
They always try to obtain their new ways .
Because They want to be the first one .

They think , Being best is more important than doing best .
To be the first is a big achievement .

Additionally , They need strengthen their own company if they have it .
It is not easy to make more strengthen it .
But they know how to manage their own money and how to manage people .
because they are successful people already .

To sum up , I would like say that Sucessful people have an ambitious .
