I agree with this statement .
Of course some people might say that learning facts is more impotant .
However , it is clear to me that understanding ideas and concepts outweight than learning facts .

First of all , education is for improving capacity of student 's thinking .
If teachers stick their own idea , then students only can think teacher 's way .
That prevent increasing student 's thinking .
And , also as we can see , nowadays many schools have student-centered classes to give student think more .

In addition , In our country - South of Korea - , most of classes are only for leran facts .
Teachers do n't ask student 's thinking , students only listen and write what teacher says .
So that my country 's people weak of imagination .
But as you know , imagination is the power of future .

Finally , students can more concentrate on thier studies .
Thinking something , imagne somethings are very interesting .
