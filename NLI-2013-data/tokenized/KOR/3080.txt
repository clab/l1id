` When I sow the rainbow , my heart leaps. ' although I cannot remember the phase of the poem exactly , It is very famouse poem the ` Rainbow ' Wordwores 's .
Hwo often do you feel the haert 's leaping ?
I think the leapping of heart can representate a kind of passions .
the authoer say that If he 's heart not leaps anymore when he sow the rainbow , he 'd like to die .
It can look like too vertical expressions , but I absolutly agree with the author .
I believe that If the passion about enjoying of life is offer to pleasure in life , the age is does n't matter to enjoy our life .

I 'd like to say the passion and curiocity as the critical thing to enjoy our life ratter than simply age .
I can understand the young people and nomally more energetic and exciting than old people .
But I do n't think that the age can determind how energetic they are or how enjoy their life .
I know one person who enjoy his life with passion .
He studyies in my universty as an honorific student .
He is belongin a inline sketing club , and theaching korean traditional instruments inweekend , moreover volunteering for homeless .
you know what ?
His age is 76 .

In contrast , I know several young people who have any passion to enjoy thier life and young .
they spend time in their room by cheating or game with complains like that ` what a boriong day .
I have nothing to do , nothing to enjoy , nothing ~ ~ . `` although they are young , but they do n't have any passion to enjoy their life .

So , I think more important thing to enjoy life is the passion and eager to enjoy their life not just age .
I gues I 'm enjoy my life enough , and I really hope that my passion wuold not shrink as time goes by and get age .
When I think about my passion
