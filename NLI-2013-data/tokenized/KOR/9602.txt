Most successful people already know how to do well .
However I think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Thus , I agree that successful people have experience of trying new things and taking risks .
There are several reasons .

First of all , successful people have a lot of direct experience .
For example , social experiences , leadership experiences , risk experiences , and so on .
Successful people offer lots of lessons to ours .
If successful people do n't have a lot of experience , I ca n't liten about lessons .

Second , they are not successful people who already know how to do well .
I have a personal experience .
When i was 23 years old , I earned a ward about design .
I had to design very hard every day .

I had a good chance that i could already know concept choosing art 's works .
I could not recieve the ward .
However , i can gain my famous but i was uncompertatal .
I was not successful person .

So I have not a computition and important meaning .
To sum up , successful people
