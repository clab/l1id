Although I think I am young , I can not enjoy my life because of lack of money and time .
I had to study hard to attend a good university since I was a child .
After graduating from university , I also had to get a job to earn money for living .
As a result , I disagree that young people enjoy their lives than older people do because of lack or money and time .
I think that the older can enjoy life more .

First of all , the older have more money than the young .
we need money to do something .
If I like reading novels , I have to buy books .
If I like a travel , I have to buy a car or buy a expensive airline ticket for going abrod .
Because of this money problem , I can not often travel abroad .
However , my parents used to go abroad for their enjoyment because they are rich .
They have enough nomey to buy expensive tickets and to pay for luxury hotel room .
I am envious his welth , so I am working hard to earn more money .

Secondly , young people have no enough time to enjoy their lives .
when they were child , they have to study hard .
Because their parents want to go more high repuataional university , they have spend all time to study .
They also have no time after graduating from university .
Because tuition fee of university is very expensive , the young people would have a lot of depths after graduation .
After all , they have to work hard for the depths and then for marriage and for their children .
In contrast , old people would have a lot of time if many old people already retired .
Thus , old people were not worry about lack of time .

In conclusion , although young people have more high physical power than older people , young people can not enjoy their life more than the old people because young people have no enough money and time .
As a result , I disagree that the young enjoys life more than the old does .
I think that when young people work hard , they can be seen a good people .
