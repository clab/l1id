However successful people they get over what they have some difficulties in , and they became succeeded .

In addition , in terms of history , high risks have bought high benfits .

For example , Columbus bonyaged long distance form spain to find new world before nobody never tired because of the dangerous .
Nevertheless , he overcame whole obbstacles , and at the last he achieved huge fame .

Finally , people who have ever tried to take some risks to succeed might have failed at least one time .
Thus their will for being successful is more stronger than the others who have never taken any risk and never failed .
After they failed one time , the could know how to avoid being failed for the next time .

To sump up , people who are successful have the reason why they are .
They took more risk than other and they overcame , and they finally learend how to avoid being failed .
