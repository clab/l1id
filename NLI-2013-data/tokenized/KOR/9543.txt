In these days , many people believe that doing what they alrealy taken certain jobs or activities is more beneficial and stable to maintain their making money .
However , contrary to the popular trend , I strongly believe that trying new things and being a risk-taker is much better than being stationary .
The rationale behind this is that contacting with new people and having an opportunity to success .

First of all , trying innovative things can play a vital role in creating many places to meet various people .
It is largely because trying the inventive things , such as self-performance on the streets .
From my experience , I decided an important decision that affects my future life .
The decision is studying abroad in New York .
Before determining my direction about going the United Stated , I thought about the futures as well as my friends do .
In contrast , I finally came the city to study modern education .
Accordingly I could meet a variety of people who work different and unique jobs .
Additionally , I am living with African-American person who has five jobs .
I could learn many cultural differences and adopt this cultual gradually .
If I had not been for taking a risk through abandoning my routine routes , I could not have met the kinds of person .

Furthermore , Being a risk-taker contributes to catching opportunities to success .
It is attributed to the fact that being in some places that can be dangerous situation , such as a owner of venture marketing includes advantages and disadvantages .
However , a considerable amount of statistics have proven that the advantages are outweigh than another .
The best example of this is my father 's case .
My father , Mr. Sung , started an own enterprising about manufacturing of paints 6 years ago .
Many peopel said that the case would be harmful to live and maintain our family 's economic situation .
However , he continuously struggled to overcome many risky problems .
Finally , we have got great success .
If my father had not taken the big adventure , our family would have remained as a level of the poor .

In conclusion , without the slightest doubt , trying new opportunity is more beneficial than staying stablely .
The reasons are that connecting with new people and new chances to succeed was provided by taking risks .
All in all .
I firmly agree that the saying , `` No pains , no gains . ''
Taking risk and meeting chances only create success .
