Numerous people live together in our society .
Some people are young , and others are old .
Sometimes , we can hear that older people say to young prople `` I envy you because you are enjoying your life so much . ''
However , I doubt the idea which young people enjoy their lives more than older people .
As far as I am concerned , they are too busy to enjoy their lives because young people have a lot of responsibilities to have to do .

First , young people have to study for their future .
For example , high school students in Korea spend over 15 hours to study every day .
In my case , I have been studied Toefl over 10 hours a day after I decided to go a university abroad .
Do you think that we seem to enjoy our lives ?

Second , young people have to earn money hardly to support their children .
One of my friends hate his job .
He is working as engineer , but he actual dream is to be a writer for novel .
However , he can not quit the job becuase his son was just born last year .
He does n't think that he can afford his family doing what he really wants .
How sad it is !

Finally , young people a lot of concerns about their future .
For example , according a research , 80 % of Korean junior high school students answer that they are not happy to the question '' Are you happy ? '' because they get tons of stresses from study and feel nervous about their futures .
It is not diffrent for people who work after graduating school .
Many people are not satisfied with their lives and are worried about their future .
They are young ; it means they have a lot of difficulties for the future for them .

Therefore , I ca n't agree with the idea which young people enjoy their life more than older people .
Actually , I belive that they could more enjoy they lives when they get older after they are done on their responsibilities .
