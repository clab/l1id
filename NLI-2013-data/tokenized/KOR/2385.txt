I agree to that statement .
because young people have more power than older people but they have no experiences .
and young people do not know how to use their energy wisely .
so they behave which they want to do .
Most of that is playng .
but i 'm not sure that playng out side , dance and play video games are enjoy their life .
There 's few people that working hard is enjoying their life .

Young people have not to work earn money , they only know about spend money .
but older people have to make money , most of them have family .
they have to make money and save them .
so older people know that enjoy life when they are adult is going to bankrupt .

But young people do not have to worry about that .
Study is the biggest enemy of young people , but many of them do not know If they study hard , they can enjoy life more than young people .

When i go to the shopping mall or something like that , there are many young people more than older people .
some young people spend more money than older people , play a lot , and have a party with their friend .

But many older people think that enjoy life is not bad for young people so they let their children play .
But if older people have the time like young people they might be enjoy their life like young people .
Older people want to enjoy their life .
There are many older people that enjoy their life .

Young people enjoy their life more than older people , but i wish young people study hard during the childhood and enjoy their life when they become a success man .
It is better than play during the childhood and become fail about their job .
I saw many wise people that study hard , do not play and be a successful .
