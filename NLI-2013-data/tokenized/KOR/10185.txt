Many people are afraid when they try something new .
On the other hand , some people enjoy the afraid feeling and the risks .
Many times , the some people , who try something not familiar , could be successful , fortunately .
In my opinion , trying new things is effective and essential to make one 's life and others ' lives successful .

The first reason why I think trying something new is right is that it needs to be brave .
Even though there are a lot of damages and risks as you try a new thing , the difficulties probably can give chances to your life .
Bravery is one of the most important factors in order to not only be success but also live confidence .
In that , trying something new means the person is very brave , which need to be self-esteem oneself .
I believe someone , who loves oneself , can enjoy his or her life .

In addition , trying something new gives more oppurtunities .
If you do what you already know how to do well , you would probably do not fail .
However , you cannot success as much as you want , because the ordinary thing is for everyone .
The new things are only way to get more oppurtunities .
For example , Bill Gates is the richest person in the world .
However , at first , his company was not that much wealthy to make him the wealthiest person in the Earth , because `` computer business '' was not famous , then .
Fortunately , Gates chanllenges into the new field , and he attains his goals and helps other humans to enjoy computers .

Finally , trying new things makes the world improved .
When people who try new things success , it means the world becomes more comfortable .
Such as many inventors , scientists , or artists are the person who do express their idea in a new thing .
Because of their bravery , many human beings ' lives become more convenience and interesting .

Successful people who try new things should be honoured by other people .
I also want to be a successful people in order to improve not only me and but also other people .
Even though the first time to try new things is hard , I will not be afraid of doing that .
For thes reasons , I think trying new things is effective and essential to make one 's life and others ' lives happier .
