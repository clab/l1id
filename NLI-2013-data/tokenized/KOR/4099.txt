Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , Even two or three decades ago , there are many people who intend to help their commuinities .
Because about three decades ago , most of the country in the world were developing country .

In developing country , their industry is establing on the product which need a lot of labours , More people attended a industry , more profit would be given .
One person have limit to do his work in order to do plenty of tasks .
For more productivity .
people in this social structure sould come along with other people .

But nowadays As industry of a country grows faster , the proportion of industry has changed .
Society of fouded by Knowledge come up !
This society does n't require cooperaition like the ealier society , Developing internet communication system does n't require face-to-face work as much as society of labor .
So Nowadays young people do n't need that they should be helping their community as a member of their coummunity .
And another important reason is competing is more serious than earlier society , Many media and company emphasize competence of their rival than cooperation , So young people think dedicated to themseleves except other member of communities are benefitble .
