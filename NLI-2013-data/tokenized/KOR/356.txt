People may not deny that famous artist and actors are educated and trained by special programs even since their childhood .
Even though they do not have broad knowledge , they can be successful people because they are an expert in their special field .
walking dictionaries cannot survive anymore in this dog-eat-dog society .

When I heard the story of my aunt , I was amazed .
My aunt who really likes dancing was a trouble maker in the school when she was a teenager .
She only thinks about dance , but not school working .
She was failing in almost every subjects .
Her parents and teachers were very worried about her .
She could not even adapt to school life because everybody thought she is very stupid .
Nevertheless she did not care what others think .
She just keep practicing dancing and singing .

Nobody never thinks that she would become such a popular person .
10 years later , everybody was surprised and amazed at her .
The reason everybody was surprised , she became a actress who is acting on musical stages .
Everybody wants to see her acting .
Her dancing and singing make people fascinating and happy .
Her picture and interviews were on Newspapers , magazines and TV shows .
Now nobody thinks that she is `` stupid . ''

People who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are obviously very smart but they might not know what is he or she really interested in .
However , people who love speicific subject know what they are intersted in and why they are studying that subject , thus , they can learn more and deeper .
