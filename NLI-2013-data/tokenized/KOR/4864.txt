I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Whenever , I watch the television I always face to a lot of advertisement .
they keep give me a information that i do n't know .

first , the most important goal of the advertisement is promoting the sales .
How can they acheive this goal ?
they have to attract cosumer .
In order to see the information about that we need to see the aim of businessman .
It may be fulfiled by giving good information to them .

If they success for catching the consumer 's eye , it is evaluated very succesful adverisement .
most advertiser 's concerning is catching the consummer .
so it is no wonder that they inform their product very well .

Second , advertiser want to their product is showed diffrent from the other .
Studies has showed that people tend to like beutiful things .
They prefer person who is charming .
It is very important not only human but also product .

In my experience , I want to buy mp3 player so I gathered information internet and advertisement .
Finally , I decide what I want , then I went to the electronic shopping mall .
It was quite disappointed when I went to the shopping mall and saw the real one .
Most of all , the function that refer to the advertisement does n't work .

The world keep change and the profit , in particular money , which people make , is very important role in person 's lives now .
It 's very important role that consumer have an eye for determine and criticize many commodities .
