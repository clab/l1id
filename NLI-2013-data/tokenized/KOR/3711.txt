I tortally agree about this issue .
In these days , The youth are extremly busy .
I mean they have no spare time to help their communities .
The society wants that young people become a perfect person .
Nowadays the rate of jobless people is more and more increasing , Moreover it .
spreads wide that the entrance exam to college is most important in one 's life .
Because of this situation , schools and their parents require them just ` Studying ' .

This is a middle-school student 's time table .
She wakes up at 7 AM and then goes to school .
After the class ' over at 4 or 5 PM , they goes to institute learning math , english , even chinese every day .
They are always stressed out for their life without a chance to do something .
So the reason is why they can not have time to help their communities if they wants .
