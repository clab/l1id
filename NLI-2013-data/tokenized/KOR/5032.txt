I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than tehy really are , and it is definately a requirement for company to sell its products more .
The company has to introduce its products in a best way to attract customers , and to make most profits .

What will you do , if you have to introduce yourself in a interview at the colleage where you want to go ?
I can tell most of people introduce themselves in a best way that they can get into the colleages where they want to go .
This is same as why the products are different from the advertisement .
The company has to introduce its new items in a best way to attract people 's eyes .
Did you ever go into clothes shop , which has only looking bad clothes ?
Because people usually think from what they see , the company put its best efforts to make its products look great .

For exmaple , the advertisement of boy 's toys has great backgrounds and sound effection , so when I was young I used to buy after I saw adverstisement of toys .
How about the food 's advertisement ?
From the advertisements , everysingle food looks great , because the foods are colored with special inks , so they looks much better than they really are .
As I mentioned with two examples , the advertisements make look much better the products on TV shows , and I can tell everysingle adverstisements is made up for making looks better company 's item .

There are many people who blame about the advertisement because of the difference between real products and products from the TV , however , we need to understand the difference .
Therefore , making products seem much better than how products really are ture and understandable .
