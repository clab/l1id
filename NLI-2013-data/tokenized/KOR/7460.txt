Recently , it is more common to have a tour guide while travelling than going a trip without a tour guide .
While some people like to have a tour guide to see many attractive sites , in my opinion it is not the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide because of it has lots of restrictions .

First of all , people travelling with a group led by a tour guide have a time constraint while travelling .
Suppose you want to spend more time in a museum than in anywhere else , but you are given only 20 minutes to stay in the museum .
How possible is it for you to stay when the bus leaves after that ?
If you have the flexibility of your time , you would not have to encounter this kind of problem .

Second of all , travelling with a tour guide with a lot of people will more likely give less personal experiences .
I would like to give my experience as an example .
Last summer I went to a trip to the Rocky mountains in British Columbia Canada with around 30 other people and a tour guide .
We went to so many places in such a short time so that I could not remember where I went .
When I was checking the photographs that I have taken , I could not say any difference about the lakes and mountains that I have went .
Even though I have seen only lakes and mountains for the whole three days , I could not remember one of them in special , because we had spent only short amount of time on each place so that I did not have any special memory or a feeling in one site .

To conclude , I would rather travel with my few close people without a tour guide than having lots of restrictions while traveling .
A famous poet said , ' Travel to discover yourself . '
I would rather have more time for myself in one site while travelling than visiting many spaces without any specail memory .
