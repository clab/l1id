I agree that knowing broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than just knowing one specific subject .
The first reason is that knowing just one specific subject period is over .
Knowing about one specific subject is important but with one subject is not enough .
In ancient times many people tried for a long time with just one way and our generation 's goal is to combine the knowledge of many academic subjects and improve it with uniq idea , For example , these day biomath and computer programing based on math analysis is important rather than just math and biology and computer , So combining the many academic knowledge is important .

The second reason is that today we need more practical thing occured by subject .
For example in math , many people think that math does n't need in real life .
But math is used in computer , music , we can fine nature has a paterns of math and also it is used in health and biology , That means we have to find new away to use our knowledge with many other academic subject to improve out society and world .

From above , it is important to look and know about other subject because combining the many subject 's knowlege and making paratical thing by these subjects makes our world strong and improve .
