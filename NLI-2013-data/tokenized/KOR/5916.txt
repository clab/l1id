It is often said that people will not dirve a car as many as these days in future because prople want to protect envoriments .
However , I do not agree with the opinion .
I believe that people will use more cars than now in twenty years .
This is because , as population grows , demand of car also would be increase .
In addition , new cars which uses different kind of resources are starting to advent .

First , demand for car will be boomed because population is getting increase .
These day , it is almost impossible to move without car .
when we go to school , market and even parent 's house , we drive a car to get there .
This demend of car depends on population .
Following Yonsei university 's statisitcs , there are more car where many people live .
For instance , Seoul , which is a capital of Korea , is the city that have lots cars and people .
Most people live in Seoul drive a car and they plan to buy new one for children .
This shows that as population increase , more car will be driven .

Also , there are many new cars that use enviroment friendly resources such as water and sunlight .
Thoese cars will make people want to buy .
These days , many companies can produce these kinds of car without technical problem .
In a soon , people can easily see those cars on the streets .
As a result , people do not need to worry about pollution .
It will make people use more cars than before .
Most people were afraid that they will destory nature by driving a car .
However , new inventions will lead us feel free to drive .
From my personal experience , I felt it is not agood idea to drive a car which makes lots of air pollutions .
However , When I saw water generated car , I do not worry about that peoblems and want to buy it .
It is clearly show that new cars will lead bigger car markets .

In summary , I firmly believe that there will be more cars than there are today .
Increasing population and new cars which operated by enviroment friendly resources such as sunlight and water will result this phenomenon , People should focus on how they improve the situation , not prevent .
