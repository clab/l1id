I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more beneficial than learning facts to students .
While understanding makes students truely keep the idea , learning fact only make student memorize the idea .
There are more advantages in understanding than in learning facts .

In these days , the society needs the people who can not only work with their knowledge but also apply it to the work place .
If the people just memorized the fact , they might be a good worker but cannot be a better worker .
In contrast , if the people understood the ideas and concept , they can develop the way they work by applying what they know .
This is the same in the class too .
In my case , I was just memorizing math formulas instead of understanding the facts .
It seemed to work very well when I do the simple questions .
However , in difference to my expectation , I was not able to solve the application questions .
So I started to understand the concept by asking my teacher .
Then , I could solve every questions on the test and recieved the good mark .

Similar to my experience in math class , one of my friend experienced the advange of understanding in English class .
She has been always hard-worker .
She does everything with her best effort .
In her English class , she worked hard on `` Hamlet . ''
She read the whole play twice and memorized important lines and devices used in the play .
Her teacher , however , did not expect the stuedents to study in that way .
Her teacher wanted his student to actually understand the play , and express the educated emotions about the play .
On her first test , she recieved faily poor mark .
So she started to look at the play in different characters ' prespectives .
Then she recieved the good mark from her English teacher .

Through my experience and my friend 's , I learned that understanding is more important than just learning or memorizing facts .
As shown above , when students just learn facts , they cannot apply their knowledge into the deep study , while those who understand the ideas and concepts can get better and better as they study .
Thus , I think students should focuss their study on understanding instead of focussing on memorizing .
