well , depends the city were you are going to live !
I agree with the point of view in general .
maybe in 20 years the changes in the diary life will change , and reduce the amount of cars .
I mean , the people in 20 years , will work at home , because they can work from their homes , for this , they need less cars than now .

another reason , the pollution .
The enviroment suffer nowadays real and strong problems .
The cars , and the industrys related , increase the problem day by day .
Is posible that in 20 years , will not possible have a lot of cars .
The goverments limit the cuantity of cars that the poblation can use .

Another reason would be the improving in public transports .
If the people have a guareente about this services , more and more the people use them , and will be less cars in the streets .

The ecological movement , many people , back to the natural , and encaurage the use of bicicles , walk .
they promote health habits , introducing another ways for moving in the cities , for example .
and at the same time , reduce the pollution .

When I mencioned the city where you will live in 20 years , depend the directions wich the goverment will take .
Not all rules , or directions , work thinking in the future .
this , some rules works in the opossite , avoinding that the people feel secure riding in bicicle , because the traffic is dangerous .
The ndustry for cars invest a lot of money in advertisments , creating the idea that you need a car .
Relatinating success with a big car for example .

In summ .
I considered that we do not need a lot of cars , and in 20 years , is totaly posible will be few cars than now .
only we need good goverments , with different concious , invest in alternative meassures for the people .
Combinating working at home , invest in the enviroment , a good enviroment , of course .
Ecological concious , etc .
