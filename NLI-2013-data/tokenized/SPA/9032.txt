well , i agree with the idea that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , i think this because when you understand something you take it for you , that is better than learn facts , if you understand the ideas they want to teach you it will be better for in the hour of the test to answer because you already have the main topic on your mind and you know what is the essential part of what you understood and learned , and in the other hand is also good if you understand the concepts they want you to learn .
althoug those concepts will help you to sometimes answer and that is another way of learning .

I disagree wiht the idea of learning facts because i do not think that is useful because that will be something you learn and did not understood , but for some students or people is better when they got the idea of the concepts , and for some others is better if is something clear for them , something that they have an idea of what is triying to understand , for example for me is more useful if i understand what the concepts and ideas are about and in that way i can always remember that , another example will be , like i have a friend she always learns facts , and at the hour of the test is more difficult for her , than it is for me but the thing is that i understood the ideas and concepts of what is the topic or theme about , but sometimes is better when you learn facts and that is all because you did not understood the concept or the idea of what they are triying to teach you .
There are a lot of factors that make students understand ideas and concepts sometimes is eassier then learning facts .
