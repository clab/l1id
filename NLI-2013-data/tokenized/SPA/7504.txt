From my personal experience the best way to travel is not by being led by a tour guide , it 's better to plan your own journey .
It is true that its not an easy process , but you have much more benefits .
For example , the money is a perfect factor to talk about .
Some agencies often charge you to much money to organize your trip , and it could not be a god idea to loose all that money when you could save the 50 percent of what you spent .
You have different stategies to find solutions .
For example , involving places to stay , such as hostels that you find in the internet that are cheper .
The experience is one of the most important elements of planning your own trip .
The process of making your own desicions and going whear ever you want can become really fun .
Last summer I went to Europe and went to Spain , France and Germany .
I organized the hole trip , day by day and it becamed a real success .
It is true that problems occured during the trip , but I think that those are part of the things that creates the adventure of the experience .

Another factor is that most agencies already have the cities in wich they are going to travell , so you do n't have many choices to explore .
On the other hand , the liberty of my schedule gave me the oportunity of even going to England for just a couple of days and in a short notice .
The schedule is led by you and not by anyone else , giving you the liberty in a place whear you had never gone to .
There is no better feeling than being in a huge place were time is not a factor and liberty is taken .
In a sense you feel so small and alone in a enormous continent but ironicly you become stronger and bigger as all the experiences satisfy your expectations .

So in general I think that backpagging is an experience that every human being must have in his life .
There is adventure , clueless bahaviours and surprises that a tour guide could not offer you .
