In my experience I have learned that having a broad knowledge of everything is much better than only just focusing in one specific subject .
When you are having a group conversation if you do n't know anything about the topic at hand you will be seen as a person without any kind of knowledge .
On the other hand , if the topic that is being discussed is your topic of specialization there will be an advantedge between you and the rest of the group .
Unfourtunately , conversation topics change a lot so the situation mentioned above will rarely happen .

I am someone who knows a lot about a lot of things , this gives me an advantedge above other people because it may give me a really good appearence .
Since apparences are vey important in modern day society having a broad knowledge is of great importance .
One example of this sort of situation can be ; if I 'm applying to a university or a job , my interviewer will not ask me questions about one topic in particular .
He will interrogate me about a series of different topics , because , in general , people want people who know about anything and everything .

In a way , society oblies you to know at least a little bit about everything .
What is the point of high school ?
High school is a phase before the university in which you are supposed to gain a wide knowledge that helps as a base for your superior studies .
Everytime you turn on the television you learn something , when you see channels , live Discovery , that specialize on documentaries on a huge variety of topics , when you read a book or magazine .
Society imposes knowledge and one should be happy to accept it and use it when ever it is oportune .
In my opinion , and based on my own experiences , I beleive that the more you know the better .
