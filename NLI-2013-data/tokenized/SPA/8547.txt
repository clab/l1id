Learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning facts .
Understanding the ideas and concepts is a very important step in the learning process , it helps students absorbe the essence of the topic .
For example : Jenny has to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusions based on her knowledge .
Tis step is more general , it includes more aspects than the next one .

After getting the main points of a lesson , students learn the facts .
this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied .
In contrast with understandind the ideas , learning facts is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspects of your interest .

In my opinion understanding the ideas and concepts is as important as learning the facts .
I have been in contact with both of the ways of studiyng and I have got better grades when I learn the facts than when I focuse on understanding the lesson .
Even though when I learn the facts I usually dont get the esence of the lesson , I get better grades .
It is a little absurd but almost all of my classmates had the same problem .
That is why I state in my personal opinion that the understanding is as important as memorizing .
It is a way of itegrating two proceses that complete each other and forming a whole , joining both steps .
As a result the flaws of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa .

For me , the perfect learning process would be the one which includes both of the steps mentioned above , linking them by relating the overview of a lesson with the specific facts that support it .
