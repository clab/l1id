I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will fewer cars in use than there are today .

As cars become cheaper , safer and more user-friendly , more people will choose cars as their main means of transportation .

Some people may argue that technological advances in telecommunications may reduce the need for transportation .
I think that , while it is true that there has already been a general decrease in business trips , the use of cars for private transportation will continue to increase in the future .

Others may argue that more efficient public transportation will render cars obsolete .
However , I believe that although public transportation is a key factor in development , it will never substitute cars because of its inherent limitations .

The cost of producing a car has been greatly reduced in recent years whereas their convenience and performance continues to increase .
Nowadays fully equiped cars such as the Renault Logan or the Subaru Pleo cost around three thousand dollars to produce and are sold for aroudn five thousand .

Another important factor is the rapid growth of the automotive markets in developing countries such as India , China or Brazil .
In these countries still relatively few people own a car but there is a great potential for growth .
In China , for example , last year saw a twenty percent increase in units sold .
Following this trend , many car manufacturers are launching low cost BRIC ( which stands for Brazil , Russia , India , China ) product lines designed to meet these market 's demands .

In conclusion , although it is true that the use of cars may be reduced in specific situations , I believe that in general the number of cars will continue increasing .
