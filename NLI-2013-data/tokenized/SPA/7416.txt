I think it is very relative the answer to this question .
Relative because of the kind of people who are traveling .
In my opinion , I would prefer to travel with a tour guide , who can help me with any doubt that I would have , and that would be with me always explaing to me the history of the place I am visiting ( thing which I consider very important ) .

But there exists persons who prefer to make their trip alone , without any tour guide to be there to help them in any problem they could have during their travel .
I have an idea of that people as very independant people , who like to take the risk of being almost lost , or maybe they just feel more adventure when during their time in the trip , they doesnt depend on anyone to make the things done .
Personally I do not prefer this way of traveling , as I already said , but I would make an exception just if the place where I am visiting , I already know .

I consider that it would be surely complete the tour to the place , if you go in company of some one whose work is to show the history to people , and to explain how does things works in the place .
Because not evry single detail is on a tourist map , is it ?
there are not better instructions for the people who are tourists , as the ones of the `` natives '' .

There is just one thing in which I agree with the people who does n't take a tourist guide to lead their trip , is that some times it is a lot much better to be alone , and to discover the place mysteries be one 's self .
I think that is the only point with wich I would agree with the travelers who does not take a tour guide .

So it is very relative what would be best for people , because there are a lot of different points of view .
