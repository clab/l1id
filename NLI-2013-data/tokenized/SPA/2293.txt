Due to the very fact that the Question Statement entails a broad generalization , I must disagree with it , as generalizations normally look inaccurate to me .
Notwithstanding , I would like to provide some personal insight in order to explain why I also disagree with such statement due to the fact that it looks , from my point of view , totally misleading .

Although we can find very different enjoyment levels in those persons around us , young people do not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do , and vice-versa .
I acknowledge the fact that there are really happy young persons , but just as much as I acknowledge the fact that there are also lots of really happy older persons .
I do believe , however , that both populations groups enjoy life somewhat differently : - While young people tend to have a more active lifestyle , generally doing more exercise and having a more intense social life , older people seem to have more sedentary habits , usually prefering to stay at home longer hours and also increasing the amount of time they spend with their spouses or families , at the expense of the time dedicated to social activities with non-relatives .

- Another difference that can explain why young and older people lifestyles differ so much is the level and nature of their responsibility .
Younger people can usually enjoy themselves without having to worry too much for anybody else , as they do not normally have children or grandchildren to feed and take care of .
On the other hand , older persons are generally responsible , at least partially , for the education and the welfare of their offspring , which although entails quite a bit of time and effort , is often regarded of as a very rejoycing experience .

- Last , but not least , the level of physical and mental health has also a great impact on both young and older people .
While the former generally enjoy stronger and healthier bodies that help them carry out and enjoy more intense physical activities , the latter are normally considered to be wiser and more experienced , and therefore better positioned and endowed to enjoy the quieter pleasures that life offers and fight the battles that it often presents .

The above reasons help me explain why young and older people can enjoy life equally , despite having very different lifestyles !
