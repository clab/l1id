Whether it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide or just by your own , has both advantages and disadvantages depending on many factors or characteristics of the trip .
Three importants factors are : the amount of money the person has , for how much time he will be travelling , and the personal oppinion about flexibility .

Firstly , hireing a tour guide can be very expensive and , in some cases , much more expensiver that travelling alone .
For example , it is free to go through Paris walking on your own , and it can be very expensive to pay for a group tour .
Nonetheless , you will probably need to buy a guide if you do not want to miss the important places .
It is cheaper to walk on your own only if the guide is not as expensive as the tour .

Secondly , a guided tour works better for someone who has not got too much time to visit a place .
In this case , he will have someone to take him to the unmissable places and to give him some explanations .
On the other hand , if someone has , for example , three month to visit two cities , he will probably have time to get around on his own , ask for some advise to different local people and see or visit much more different places than the number of places he would visit on a guided group tour .

The third factor has to do with preferences .
People have different oppinion about how much flexibility they like to have when they are travelling , and there is not only one correct or a best oppinion .
Some people like to have a schedule that details every place they will visit , and what they will do every day .
However , other people like to feel free to do what they feel like doing on each day , depending , for example , on their mood .
In spite of the fact that a person can make a detailed schedule when travelling alone , on guided tours , people are usually less free to do what they feel like doing on that day .

In conclusion , there is not one best way to travel .
Everyone can have their own best way depending on their personal characteristics and on the trip they are planning to take .
Therefore , each person has to decide whether to travel in a group with a tour guide or by their own .
