I think this is the main porpuse of the advertisements , make to believe people to adquiere their products because they are very useful , attractive or is going to solve most of the problems that are making you mad at the moment .

But the real deal here , is that advertisements are a brain washer for everyone that sees them .
In countries of the first world most of them , are very persuasive and make you buy that product .
They use all the tools and all the media to get thru your eyes .

The ads in the tv , are so colorful and so vivid that you realy like them and al last you finish buying what the ads was promotionig .

The technology has become a real advantage for the human kind , and the big corporations use this , in their big companies to make this advertisements .
Everybody can see this on tv , hear then in the radio , they even stick big stickers in the buses , pul masive pictures in the big avenues , in the top of the buildings .
In the bathroom you can do 2 things at the same time , while somene is doing they natural physiological needs the Marketing is attacking you in the posters or even in the small tv screens tagged in the walls .

Getting out of the point just bit I believe the advertisements are a waesting of money , which only the big companies get benefits and none people that really need it I know that probably saying that sounds hilarious but it should be a law againt this masive weasting of money , we have to end the domination of this companies who ruled this world .

Is impossible that it happend but imagine if they save this quantity of money and with it give it to the persons who need it for real .
They will help to build up a better world with better opportunities for every one .
