in this case i could agree because when someone travel to a new place its because he/she want to know that place or spend a good time there .
so i think when people look for help from a guide or someone who can help them , it would be a great idea to have fun and save time .
people ask themselves ..
why save time ?
because in many times familys or groups of people who want to travel never take precautions about some risk that they could have in their travel .
when we talk about risk we could say ...
they dont know the city , the dont know the culture ( differents countries ) , they dont know a good place to stay or sometimes they dont speak the languague from that place , in many cases people have been mad or sad because they lost time or they lost their vacations for dont take good precautions .
therefore its vital when someone want to travel to take precautions .

for other side when people know everything or almost everyting about the place , its not necesary to ask help to a guide .
like that they can be alone and get privacity .
also they can feel free when they want to choose their decisions .

in my case i like to plain before of travel , i wouldnt like loose my vacations or spend bad time .
for me its different when i travel with my friends , because when we are young , we love the adventures and enjoy crazy times with your friends , of course ..
with responsability .
so when i travel with my friends i dont plain too much .
in other side when i travel with my family its different because i travel with adult people , we look for spend a good time in family everyone together , therefore we have to plain better our trips .

in conclution i agree with the statement because its better take precautions then spend a bad time looking for help .
