Life goes by every second of our lives .
As a person gets older , not only his or her body is in constant deterioration , but also his or her mind , ideals , and thoughts .
An elderly can hardly jump the rope or play football , but a teenager can accomplish those tasks with great facility .
Young people can practice a wide variety of activities with little or no limitations .
From parachuting to eating a family-size pizza , the young are always on a better condition , mentally and phisicaly .
Therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This asserttion can be exemplified by a personal experience that I had with my grandfather when I was 14 and with today 's wars .

As a young teenager , I was always able to spend time with my grandfather .
I felt a great respect towards him .
Yet , I was able to regard the differences between us .
I ate hot-dogs and he vegetables .
One day , when we went bowling , he felt on the middle of the lane while slowly throwing the ball .
I panic at that time , but later I apprehended that not everyone is similar .
I was able to discover and to realize that my grandfather could not have fun as easy as I could .
His steps were slow and hardly-accomplished , while I ran in and out of the house .
This experience let me to the belief that when one is old , it is no longer possible to enjoy life much .

Not only I have found experiences of myself for stating that young people enjoy life more than olders do , but society arrangement proves it by itself .
The war that today affects some parts of the world is a clear and vivid example .
Very young people on the Middle East are violentaly in combat .
It is not neccessary a ` fun activity ' , but rahter a way on defending their beliefs and their way of enjoying their life .
It is not often to see a 70-year-old dead by combat means .
The possibilities for a wide of spectrum of activities offered to young people aloud them enjoy the fascination of their lifes .

Life is short and our ` young lives ' are even shorter .
We should discover and take advantage of the inmense possibilities that we have as children and as young adults .
Years are limitants to our capabilities .
Run , jump , swim , and climb today !
Enjoy now and think later !
