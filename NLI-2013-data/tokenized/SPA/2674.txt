How much people enjoys life depends on many factors .
Age maybe one of them .
But is it a decisive factor that can entitled young people to enjoy life and older people not ?

Typically young people appears to be more energetic , situtation that is normally refered to as `` being full of life '' .
I agree with this affirmation but only in some extent .
For example , most of young people do not have the amount of responsabilities that older people have like childrens or a job from which susbsistence of your family depends on .
Furthermore , older people tends to have mental burdens that come from decisions made in the past that are not satisfying their current expectations .
These burdens can bitter a person and made him or her lose the sense of life enjoyment .

On the other side , I agree with the statement that life enjoyment is not related to age .
I have a good personal example to support this point .
My mother was a person used to work during her entire life .
She worked from 7am to 5pm and even she brought work at home .
This sedentary life cause her health problems , like hypersensibility to weather changes ( she got a flu pretty easily ) and started to get fatter .
This situation basically deprived her from enjoying life .
She looked always sad and bitter and she started to seek a way to relieve watching TV , which in turn kept her away from friends and family avoiding her enjoyment of her personal relationships .
Three years ago , she started to go to a dance group in a local gym where she found herself comfortable and truly animated .
Right now , she dances every day .
Her health has improved considerably , his personal and social life has ameliorated to the point that now she is a different woman , one more confident that looks always happy .
In the same way , another example is my friend Carlos .
He is very young .
However , five years ago he missed the opportunity to study a doctor program in the US because he had personal problems with and ex girl friend .
He was already studying the program , then he had to drop out university .
Since then , he does not forgive himself from this situation and constantly looks sad and depressed .

Based on the reasons and examples provided I have to disagree with the statement presented .
I think that the mental and emotional framework in which people based their actions determines how much they enjoy life regarless their age .
