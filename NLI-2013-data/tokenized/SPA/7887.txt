Personally , i preffer to travel without a tour guide , tour travels are regularly done by a schedule , it has its own agenda and i preffer to take my time in things that in things that interest me the most .

The best way for me is use a map , which i found very easy to use , and before going out on the first day do an itinerary of things you are more interesting in seeing or doing .
for example i was in paris last summer with my girlfriend , we bought a map of the city and we researched on the internet the most interesting places in paris , we searched each site on the map and did a 3 day route of what we wanted to do , all the places of those areas we wanted to visit and in the end we still had a lot of time to enjoy more places than we tought .
this way you dont have to be stuck in places you might get boring .
When i got home i showed all the pictures to my father of all the places we went , because he went to the same city 2 years ago , with a tour guide and he said they didnt even visited 50 % of the places we visited without the tourist guide .

I recommend tourist guide trips for older people who have never visited a city or for teenagers who wants to know more about the culture of the places .
Traveling on your own helps you grow as a person , helps you not to depend on others , helps you to be more independent and also to discover things for yourself .

Tourist guides may think what places are better for your learning and what are the most important places of each city , but in the end i preffer to travel alone .
