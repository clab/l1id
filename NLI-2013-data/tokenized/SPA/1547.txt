I agree ; because many academic subjects are going to improve the knowlege of the students , to get more information in regard to what does happen arround the word ; in addition the other subject that are not on the major is to make the students how can their specific subject contibute to others areas .

The first idea is to get more information that the academic people had gotten in a specfic subject .
this is important because the students would be interested in regard to others assignatures like politics , economics , urbanism , etc .
Those assignatures are called `` General Subjects '' .
Then when the students study those subjects , they learned about what happened arround the world .
This means what are the causes that the facts success and the consequences ( good or bad ) these gave .
For example : In my country , my major is Computer Engineering and the last term I learned about the Urbanism , and the progression of the cities arround the world , the causes of these progresses in regard to the health and organization abuot the building and houses .

The results to this topic is to improve the student in regard to how can the specifics subject contribute to these .
This is the best part , because it make to built the answers in regard to the fact .
In addition in my example : I can to reorganize the reality of the city , to help the government housing plan ; other could be , to vreate a tridimensional video to help the urbanism professors , experts and/or students ; or build a video-game about the race , war , trip , etc .

I said in the beginning that this statement can help to the students to increase the information about the world .
