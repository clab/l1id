The belief that a life without risks is better is common among many people .
But is it true ?
I would like to start with an example , for it is always better to `` get the picture '' before hearing arguments on a topic .
Cristobal Colon discovered America .
Everybody knows that .
But would that have been possible without him taking the risk of navigating into unknown waters accompained with nothing but criminals ?
I do not think so .

So , everybody who believes that Colon was succesful should also think that to be succesful you have to try new things , to risk something .
If it is not so , that is why I have further arguments .

As a Business Administration student I have learnt that the essential aspect of having a productive and growing business is to make decisions knowing that the chance of losing is always present , but that the wish of improving should be stronger than this fear .
`` Use fear as a motor not as a break '' some say , correctly .
Life can be seen as a business , you always have to do something in order to achieve what you want , it is an exchange of services for utlities .
For this reason I believe the same rules , which have been precisely studied during these last years , could and should be applied to our everyday routine .

Lets examine the situation from another point of view .
Someone has achieved a state in his life , where he believes no more is to be improved .
This person has a plan for the rest of his life .
At the begining it will surely feel nice to have this kind of security and peace , and that is not negative .
But after a while , he will get bored , for the human is the kind of specie that must always do something different in order not to get frustrated .
If not , the work policies of the Industrial Revolution would still persist .
The thing is , that by the time this individual of the example realizes he is bored , he will have lost the confidence to try new things , to risk some of that security and will enter a great frustration , not likely to maintain him in a successful state .

Furthermore , society and its elements are not at all stable , it changes constantly , as do the necessities of the people .
In order to be succesful one has to be able to adapt fastly to these new demands , and in order to achieve that sacrifices must be done .

I conclusion , I believe that the statement that risks and new creations are basic elements of success are nothing but correct .
Remember the automobile or a more recent example , the Internet ?
Those are all inventions of peple who tried to do what noone else before them had , and insisted even though many thought of them as crazy .
