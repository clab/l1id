The advertisement world sometimes is bigger than the cuality of the products .
I have to agree with the statement because the world now a days is based on consuming and selling as much as possiible .

Fisrt everything comes first right in to the human eye , what looks atractive , new and original is always an eye catcher , and this has been proved , even I am a victim of those atractive things , is something comun and usual to find .
As examples we have Coca Cola and Pepsi , is obvious they compit with each other and sometimes roughly , it is really a war .
And here is easy to read a great advertisment campaing

Second , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advances poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition has grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and as long as it sails is fine for any company who needs advertising .
Is has been seen in the aspects of beauty , advertisemtn controls the worlds thoughts and minds , because of the amoo8ount and constant information they send , as an exapmle Abercrombie has this message of sexy and the the sailers are all good looking and grat bodys .
And evidentiially all kind of people wanting this things go and buy there , is theyr way of sailing .

Third because the people are been bombarded constantly by propaganda , now is not a competition betwen products is betwen the best advertising .
So now the companys have to figure out how to catch the eye of at least one person , and sicceed with the porpouse states at the propaganda .

But what became a tool , now created a silent war between products and companys that are competion .
The best advertising wins ; but this leaves sometimes a side the cuality of the products , in many occations we can find that you buy something because of the exterior nad it ends up been junk or a disaster or just what you were not expecting .
As an example I bought a drink nad it looked good , delicious but the taste was extremely sweet nad gave a head ache .
So in conclution even a fantastci advertisment can be junk or not really what they are selling .
