I think is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects intead of specialize in one specific subject .
For example lets says that maria was invited to dinner and unfortunaly for her , she was the only youngest person on the table , so the other people would start talking about different topics and time to time maria would hace to disscus with the others , but if maria only has the knowledge for one topic , that would be embarsing for maria because she would be not able to answers or disscus with other people that had the knowledge that she doesnt have .

Currently in our society a lot of topics need to be discuss , another example would be referent to mathematics , we use mathematics all the time and daily in our lifes , but the word math not only envolves one topic , also is related to our daily life , when we go shooping we use math to buy thing and calculate the prize , or buying food .
like i said math is not only one topic but is also related to everything that sorround us .

Nevertheless , a lot of people think that if they study for being a biologist , they are also studying the enviromental life and some topics related to nature , animals and their behavior , also include math because they not only going to learn about the enviroment but also they need to calculate the population of animals , plants .

Indeed , we can see the importance of knowing more than one subject because is very usefull in our daily life , instead of specialize in one subject for those people that only had the knowledge in one topic or subject their lifes would be not easy than the others that at least have a general idea and they can discuss some of the topics that present in our daily lifes .
