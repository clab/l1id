I disagree with this statement beacuse I can not imagine a world without cars .
How will the people move to everywhere ? .
Every year the technology is getting better and the cars are maken much better .
Now there are highbrid cars and there are cars that do n't use petrol but the light of the sun .
This means that the cars are becoming good for the enviorment .
They do n't make so much diox of carbon like before .
This is a big success .

Many people are using a lot of behiculs like a car to go to many places .
We can go from door to door easily in short time than walking .
Actually , the average of using cars is growing up every day .
So I think it will be very difficult for the people to leave their cars and start to walk or run for going somewhere .

I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than now .
In twenty years , the technics of making cars and the technology will be better , so there will be better cars than now .
Maybe in twenty years the cars could be flying on the air .
Or maybe all the cars will only use the brigth of the sun and do n't use any petrol more .

I can not imagine a world without cars .
How will the people move to everywhere ?
