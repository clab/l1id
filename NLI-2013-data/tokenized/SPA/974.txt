Supposedly , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
The truth is that both having a broad knowledge about a cornocopia of subjects and specializing in one subject are very important factors to being successful in whatever a person does in his life .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you along in the future .
It will help to develop yourself as a person like it will also create many interesting conversations in life .
For example , if a student is spacializing in art when he is asked a question about modern tecniques , it will be important for that student to know about historical events , not only in the art world but also what was going on in the country he or she is speaking of .
It will be vital for that student to understand the politics of that time , the hardships of the people , and many other contributing factors that are involved in the development of the tecnique in question .
Another example to why knowing about different subjects is important is to make yourself more educated and impress people when you speak because they get an image of you as a person that is not ignorant .

Specializing in one subject is also a vital factor in life because it is easyer to find a job when one has speciallized in one subject .
People still need specialists to work on their equipment and to run their companies .
For example , if your computer breaks down you will not ask someone who knows about computers but doesnt know how to fix it to reppair it for you , you will ask a specialist , someone that knows alot about computers because that is his strong point and he can fix it for you .
But nothing sais that you cant be a specialist and have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects .

In conclusion , both factors ( having a broad knowledge about many subjects or specializing in one subject ) are vital to having success in life .
Both will help you mature and decrease your ignorance level and both will increase your wisdom and your educational level .
