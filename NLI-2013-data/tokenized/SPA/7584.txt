I belive that is very nessesary to travel in a group but not lead by a tour guide .
If you travel in a group lets say may up with personal friend , you normally want to explore by your own , without having so mone leading you .
This way you woukdnt have any problems in wanting to go some where else or wanting to just having fun .

In a personal experience not very long ago , i went with a group of friend to Paris .
We went by owr own .
We had a graet time , we did n't learn us much us people would by a tour guide but we had a chance to explore evreything , by reading asking or even thinking by owr own minds .
Another group that went but with a tour guide , said that it was n't that great , for a matter afact , they even came earlier because they whre sik of listening about the histry of all the rocks , churches , houses , etc .
They said that it was just like a class back at home .
And because he was already paid by their parent they could n't get ride of him .

Another reason why tour guides are so boring , and is much better to go in a group , is because they want you to see everything .
Thheir is no time to waist .
This take charge of evrything , time to wake up , division time , etc .
Iam not just saying this , i know about this .
My mom who ca n't go anywhere without a tour guide always hires one for owr trips , and lety me tell you , at taht time i wish i was back at school , and iam not over reacting .

I defenetly belive that you should just travel with a group and forget the tour guide , i can ashore that you will learn us much and a great time , expect for thos people , like my mother , who ca n't go anywhere without a tour guide , if she would expirence just the group trvavel i bet she would swich .
I know that i will never hire a tour guide to show me around with a group .
