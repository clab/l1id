When we are kids , we want to do all as we can when get into adults .
I remember that I want to be a doctor , a spanish teacher , a clothes designer , and maybe a policeman .

Why I 'm bringing that memory ?
Because sometimes we have to be more like childrens .
They just want to do all and I perfectlly agree with that because If we have the capacity for learn more , why we did'nt ?

I think that is much much better to have a broad knowledge of academnic subjects .
In my personal experience when I went to high school I took a vocational course of food Administration , Preparation and Service while in the afternoons I went to the school of music .
That experience make a more independent human right now that I do n't live in my house .
My plans in that moment were keep studying to become a chef but I abondon them because I decide to study music in a Bachellor 's degree .
Then when I start studying in the music conservatory I found a new thing : `` I can sing too '' !
The Opera becomes for me a very important thing and that opens me the way to start dooing a minonor in Voice .
That thinge make me more sensitivity to music and helps improve my Tuba performece till now .

After that we realize that the conservatory gives a Theather class for sinnger 's , `` Let 's try it '' I said .
Again a great experience came to my live and I become a better human with the disciplines of theather .

Any discipline that we can learn I think that helps for our lives .
It 's like have a tool box .
You buy the tools and keep filling the box , in the way you have more tools you 're gonna be better prepared .
You 're gonna have more live experiences .
And that for me is the better that we can do .
Really , just the live knows what I 'm going to do in 20 years but , I sure that the all I 'm doing know are gonna help me forever .
