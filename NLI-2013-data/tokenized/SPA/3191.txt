From my point fo view , answering that question requires a previous one - What does the word ` community ' involve to you ? .
As far as I am concerned , that word is not affected by a lot of factors , by a number of meanings ...
Any person will probably tell you that those who develop their normal lifes around you are your community .
Being religion the main - or most common - reason for that union , most of the time .

As I see it , to find the honest , deep , vivid meaning of ` community ' you have to look much further .
I would name as my ` community ' those people who affect my life in different aspects , who have the power to change my path one way or the other .
Those people with whom i live and learn everyday .
My community and me are able to play a larger and more important part in one another 's lifes .

I do not agree with the idea of young people not using their time to help their communities .
Actually i believe that most of them do it everyday , by taking an active part in their own lifes and in the ones of those who live with them .

To exemplify my point I will add some cases considered by me as some relevant ways to help .
A boy who spends his time explaning to a classmate a problem that will help him pass an important exam .
A Law student who has to work everyday as hard as possible and study , she does not have time for herself , however , she teachs her niece English for free each weekend to help her pass , because that girl knows her brother can not afford extra English classes .

In a nutshell , if those who agree with that statement consider young people to be selfish , I think they are completely wrong .
What is more , they should take a moment to look around and to ask young people what are they doing , I am sure that they will prove them all wrong .
