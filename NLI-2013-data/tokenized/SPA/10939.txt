I completely agree with this statement .
When people try to innovate in a certain matter they are using all their capacities to obtain success .
Risking yourself will give you courage that will help you to continue the path you have proposed yourself .

All the people live with the capacity of making some improvement in something .
Some take advantage of this , some others do not .
When people try to go through the easy path , they know they will have less posibilities to fail but that they will not be able to succed .

Success is something that comes only when you really put effort in something , the most classic example would be someone trying to open a certain shop .
If that person works hard and take the risk to sell something innovating they will not always be able to grow economically but spiritually .
Knowing thay you tried best you can will be the best reward you will ever gain .

But here comes the point were we shoud ask , what is success ?
Is it obtaining economicall profit ?
Or maybe is more than that ?
Success is not something material , success is something that comes when you know you are making something you were ment to be , no matter what the odds were .
Trying hard and failing , so you have the chance to try again is the path to succes .
This is not something you will obtain by following normal patterns of behaviour or conduct .
Putting yourself in difficult situations and unpredictable scenarios makes you work at all your capacity and the reward for this is plainly success .
A man that declines a transference of his workplace to a place were he would earn more money so he can stay more time with his family , will become a succesful person .
He wo n't have economicall beneficts , but the satisfaction that his desition brought him will make him know that he triumphed in life , that he is really succesfull .

Succes will not come to people that are blindly following patterns and doing only what they think they can do , it 's in the action of taking risks were people are able to discover what they are really capable of and as a result become successful persons .
