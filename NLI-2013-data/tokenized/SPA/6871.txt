The question of whether the car will be as present in future societies as it is ours can be addressed from many points of view .
One of them is the ecologist 's : any person who is concerned about the environment will tell you that the rate at which we are polluting the planet with fumes from factories , from our heatings at home or from the exhausts of our cars is unsustainable .
The most radical think that sooner or later we will have to return to more environment-friendly means of transport such as bikes .
Another approach to the matter is that of the friends of technology .
Those who rely on technological advances to lead as to a better life will probably tell you that new cars will be invented that will not pollute .
Even if I am worried about the current environmental situation , I think the second argument is stronger .
Human beings and societies need to thrive , we cannot go back to what was being done in previous periods .
Although technology has proved hopeles at solving many aspects of human life , namely those connected with the soul , it has succeeded in making our lives easier in many ways .
If the problem of pollution is solved by inventing a new type of cars there will not necessarily be fewer cars in the future than there are today .
However , when predicting the future there are many factors we do not know at present .
Therefore there are other possible situations .
Who knows what the next invention wil
