In the past , the educational system was designed so that students would learn the `` truth '' .
This means they would have to learn by heart all the capitals of the world and know all the important historical dates perfectly .
With this methodology , It was common for a student to get hit in a classroom for not being able to do exactly what the teacher wanted .

This concept of education is now days been reevaluated .
The new way of teaching is much more productive .
Now the teacher tries to make the student understand the ideas behind the facts and not to repeat them like a parrot .
For example , is does not make sense for someone to know exactly on what day and what time did all the important battles in world war II took place , but to understand the historical situation that led them to occur .
Also , the teacher instead of hitting the student for not knowing , he encourage him to speak his mind on every subject .
That way the discussions on the classroom are a lot more productive .

The new system is more useful , in the sense that the person learn how to understand ideas , discuse them and take a position towards them .
The student 's opinion is given a lot of importance and so he will learn to think on its own and not believe everything he is told .
In the future , when the student faces real life and will have to get a job , most information learned by heart will be unuseful .
On the other hand , if he knows how to handle difficult situations and has an appropriate mental structure he will be able to do his job a lot better .
This does not means that the students will not have to learn certain facts .
Every theory is , in some way , supported by facts and this should not be forgotten .

Personally I like the better system better .
Not only because this way is nicer attending to school , but beacuse it will help us prepare a lot better for life .
Although , as always , I think that we should not believe completely in a model or system , because there is not such thing as the perfect methodology .
We should continue to learn and reevaluate our system whenever is necessary .
