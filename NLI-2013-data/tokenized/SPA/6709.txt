Nowadays there are two many cars in our cities , almost all people over age uses one , that means that a lot of pollution is produce .
This important quantity of polution wo n't carry any benefits for our lifes either for our children 's lifes .

Peolpe need to move to one place to another a lot of times during a day so they need a way of doing this movements , today cars are the only solution avaliable .
In my opinion we all should stop an think for some altenatives .
We should think in our future morover , we should think in the future of our next generations .

I think people since a little time ago people had started to realized about this issue , they had start thinking about other methods of moving themselves to one place to another , however nobody is thinking about lowering the number of cars in our planet but on the other hand they are thinking about the idea of building nonpollution cars .
So the possibility of reducing the number of cars is nowadays too far away unless a new way of traveling could be develop .

In addition not many people is interested in lowering the production of cars .
The car industry is one of the most powerfull industries all over the world , it produces a lot of profits to the main countries and too the powerfull people involve .

Above all , in twenty years there wo n't be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Anyone is interesting in lowering the number of cars furthermore a new way of traveling is not easy to be develop in such a short period of time , however we need to consider seriously the option of building better and cleaner tipes of cars .
That will contribute in reducing the pollution as the same time it gives benefit to the people that have interest on it .
