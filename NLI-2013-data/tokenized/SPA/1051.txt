Some people think that it is better to learn about lots of subjects instead of specializing in one specific subject .
I prefer the second posture , studying one specific subject .
I think like this because I would like to be the best person in the world to deal whith my future job .
If everyone thoght as me , there would n't exist competition to get job posts .
I prefer to do my best in the subject I like , rather than performing not so well in many academic subjects .

This decision should be well thought by everyone .
If we want to have a perfect world we should dedicate very hard to the subject we like .
In my opinion , when someboady finishes his or her career and has the doubt of having a master on that subject or studying another thing to broaden his or her knoledge , the decision should be the first one mentioned .

Having a broad knowledge has its advantages to .
For instance , if some one needed help , you would be able to give him a piece of advice , but this piece of advice wo n't be the same one given by a specialist in the subject .

To sum up , I think in the world should exist people with both types of knowledge , so as to complement themselves in a good way .
But , I think that there is more need of specialists than of people with a broad knowledge .

This does not mean that specialists will know only about his subject .
Then , when he finish his master , he can incorporate knowings of other types of subjects in a different way .

In conclution , I think i would prefer specializing in only one specific subject so as to be a great professional in my job .
