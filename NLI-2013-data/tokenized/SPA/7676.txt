I do agree , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , because even if you know the place where you are traveling , you still get very good deals at traveling fares , hotel discounts and special admission discounts on events that are going in the city where you are visiting .
And the tour guide will make sure the group will get the best of their trip and in my very personal opinion , is much safer to travel in group that alone , in case that any thing happened you are not in your own .
If you decide to travel alone you will probably end up paying more for everything and missing points of much interest , because one day you just may fill like staying on bed until late or going to bed early , oh well , do you know what ?
It depends where are you going and the purpose of your trip , if it is just to relax and unwind youself your best choice may be to take the trip alone or just without the tour guide , any way , just to be able to do wherever you fell like doing at the moment and going just where you feel like going , that will be great , I do not think you will miss the tour guide .
And as I mentioned before , it depends the purpose of your trip and where are you going .
