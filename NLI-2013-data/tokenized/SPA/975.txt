In the world that we live in , we cannot afford the limitations that we state to our knowledge .
This a personal barrier we unconsiously establish in our minds , limiting our personal objective 's optimum results .
We compete every day with more developed and evolutionized minds .
Qualities that a person may posses , may limit the desire to abroaden their studies .
Some determinations , obstacles or maybe the lack of interest may affect ones studies .
Setting and focusing the minds is an essential fact for abroading knowledge .

Determinations may hold one back , establishing olny to study what they are truly passionate to study .
What people do n't see is that to have to optimmum product towards being the best at your passion , one must be prepared for everything and anything .
Obstacles may be presented at a road towards succes , but the key is to overcome the obstacles and learn from them , exposing every day the best of anybody .
Another thing is the lack of interest one may gain if the subject to study is of extreme boresome .
It may be a teacher 's fault that the subject is of dislike , there by causing the desire of the students to only study the specific subject and terminate the agony .

I agree with the statement , `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects that to specialize in one specific subject . ''
.
I want to be a veterinarian , but to be successfull in the job I want to pursue , I have to study abroadly every academic subject I choose .
This will prepare me to confront any obstacle that I may enconuter on the road to success .
In conclusion , limiting our knowledge is not an option , one must always exceed the limits .
This is the road to success , to be the very best one can be , knowing the most out of our knowledge .
