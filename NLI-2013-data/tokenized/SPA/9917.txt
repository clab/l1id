I think is really necessary to take the new risks every day , if we do not take this risks is impossible to improve in our daily life , some people is only waiting to do all the activities they can do , they do not worry about to learn new things , so we can find a lot poor people .

They are not trying every day to study and to get a better position in your work , or to obtain anorther quality of life , they are only thinking in survive .
With this kind of persons our society is no possible to develop , all the countries are getting development scales is because the people is trying to do the best and working every day taking new risks , only for this way we cant to get the development .

In many situations we can find a lot a trubles , but is necessary to work very hard with the clear goals in our life , for example to take this test it was for me a new risk in my life , and if this time I can get do it I am ; proud to make my best , I now next time is possible .

All the development the countries on the world , is possible because every day we can find a lot of people taking new risks in to do something new , so they can enjoy in all time of better conditions than the poor countries , where the persons are waiting to make helped for others and few times take new risk to get the development , thats the real situation of many persons and countries on the world , I say we have to fight for to do it and to take new projects and plan new goals every day , that the way I see the things now .
