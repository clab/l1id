I agree with the point that in twenty years are going to be less cars in use .
This is going to happen because some reasons :

The first reason is for sure that people is geting concerned about the enviroment and pollution .
If we do not stop sending pollution to the air , more natural disasters will happen and nobody want to die soon .

People is getting concerned about taking care about our little planet .

Another reason is that other transports are growing , examples of this are : much more people use public transports like planes , taxis or buses because it is cheaper to move in the city by public transport , than using your own car and paying the gas .

Other reason is the continued evolution of the mechanic technology , new transports are going to appear and maybe they are less polluting than cars , but for sure this new vehicles are going to be faster , more comfortable and cheaper than a car .

Speaking about cars , we have in one hand that they are relly cheap and they are very useful , for example to go working on time , but in the other hand we have that cars are the thing that kills more people in european countries during a year .
For sure this is a good reason .

A car also is something that need cares , and you have to spend your money on it , changing thing that are not fixed enough , gas , parking and loads of other things that make very expensive having a car .

In conclusion , for all this reasons , in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and for sure , people will think twice before buying a new car , because it is something expensive , it is something that contribues to pollute our planet and is something that in twenty years , is going to be considered old-fashioned and boring .
