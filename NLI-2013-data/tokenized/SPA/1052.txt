In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowladge of many academic subjects .
There are many reasons to agree with this statement .

First of all , to apply for a job you need to know specific information about one topic .
For example if you aim to be an ingeneer you should know a lot about phisics , otherwise you will not work as an ingeneer .
There are no positions in where you can work if you do not know any specific subject .
Being specialized in one area gives you the opportunity to find a job where ever you want .

Another reason why I consider true this statement is because it does not exist a person who can earn a lot of money working , and does not been specialized in a specific subject .
That is why is so important to make a good choice when selecting a career , if not why it is so difficult to find an position with a good remuneration .
It is because if you are not a knowledge person in a specific subject you will not show superiority in comparison with other people .
It simply consist in making the difference .

Last but not least , I consider vital the thing that you need to know in deep about a subject because otherwise you will never have the incetive to keep on knowing even more and more .
If you have a broad knowladge of many academic subjects you are not able to go on learning more things .
A person need to learn every day something knew about a specific area in order to build up his futures expectations about his life .

In conclusion I consider it is much more imortant to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowladge of many acadmic subjects .
That is because is vital in applying for a position , also to be able to earn a good money and finally to have always the ambicious of knowing more and more .
