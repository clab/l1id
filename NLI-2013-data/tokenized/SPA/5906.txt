Cars are one of the most important way of transportation and they are part of our daily life .
Everyone knows someone who owns a car , or owns one himself .
A lot of teenegers buy a car as soon as they turn 18 , that is why I belive that it will be hard to reduce the amount of cars that are in use today .
I actually belive that the amount of cars will increase .

On the other hand , there are optional ways of traveling such as train , bus , metro ...
This type of transportation , public transportation , might be used by people who do n't have enough money to buy a car .
But nowadays there are a lot of sales on car selling and it is fairly easy to be able to own one .

Cars are very confortable , you can relax , sit down , listen to music and you can travel with the people you wish to travel with .
They give us freedom : you decide when you leave a place and go home , you do n't have go be waiting in the bus stop when it 's cold in winter .
People might thing that cars will not be used in the future because of the gas ; it is expensive and it is expiring .
I belive that as time goes by , experts will find other sources that will replace the gas .

20 years is a short poeriod of time for society to change so much , maybe in 200 years .
Right now cars are so into our lives that it will be very difficult to replace them .
