In many schools and institutions it is beleived that the importance in learning is by memorizing facts and concepts other than actually understanding them .
We are facing two very different types of learning and teaching , and I personally think that the best way is to analize and comprehend .

In the older days , teachers left asigments to the students of memorizing and copying facts , dates , names , numbers , among other things .
Then , the student woul 've passed not even 1 year and he would have forgotten everything the History teacher told him to memorize about the second world war .
It would n't have been of any of memorizing in the first place .

Now , in the other hand , I think that a more modern type of teaching is by making the student analize the problems and understand the answers .

For example , in mathematics or physics , instead of the teacher giving the formula to meassure the air , or to find a number , let the student find the formula by himself .

In a way , I think this type of teaching helps the student to develop certain abilitys and its esaier for them to solve problems in a far or close future .

I think it is very important to actually use the whole porcentage of brain we are capable of using and to think , and figure out our own answers .
We are not born with the abilitys we have , but we reforce them , make them stronger .

In my personal opinion , it is much more imoportant for us ( students ) to understand and comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn and memorize them .
Besides , memorizing is always boring .
Its funner to learn by aplying this type of teaching .
Thinking is fun .
Understanding is fun .
Learning is fun .
