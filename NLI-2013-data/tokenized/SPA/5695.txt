Most adverisement make prodcuts seem much better than really are

This is a theme that is always in the spotlight , and is always so controversial , that create always the same questions .
What could happen if the market when they are promoting products or services be as they are in real life , no fantasies , no like gold , that eventually marketing do that to their products ? .
Like they were , new the only thing that has n't reach the market .

Well when people asked me about my opinion of this , I think a great idea to put your prodcuts like there is nothing like them .
Because thats the reason they are selling .
And if we do n't do it , I bet a lot of sellings of some products will come down just right away .
Because in the other hand we have prodcuts that does n't need that publicity , since is a basic product , and no matter what you do n't is going to keep selling .

I know that not the best thing to do , some people just felt terrible went something is underneath their expectations , just make you feel like it was n't worth it .
That your money is value .
And to lie or play with your mind is just does n't feel right .
In my personal opinion I feel angry , and just want to takeit back .
But that the point of marketing and publicity , and those advertisement tehy put on the streets and meka you feel that sensation to own one of those .

The main point of marketing is to grow up the sellings , and if that what they need to do , is valid , they are not making nothing illegal .
Maybe may though of this , with agreing with the advertisements , is that some day in the future a would like to have my own company , and is I need to use that kind of cheat , I will use it without a questioned .
