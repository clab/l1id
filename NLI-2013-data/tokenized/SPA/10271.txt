Some people is considered successful because they have achieved great success in their careers , but what we have to think about is what makes these people successful ? , is the fact that they only do what they know best or that they take risks by exploring new career paths ? ; I will present some points that have to be considered before agreeing or disagreeing with the statement .

To check more about the subject , let 's see an example : a business man , involved in the development of computer software , has a company on which the people develop computer software products for other companies who could need them .
Maybe he has a degree on Computer Science on which he relies all the knowledge he has about the computer industry , so he could develop products based on the needs of today 's companies just using what he knows ; he only gets to work with things that he is sure that he can handle and he does not try to get involved using new technologies at all .
The company could have a good season , but in this industry you have to be ahead and know what is coming .

The problem with the example listed before , is that there are some times on which people have to take some risks if they want to succeed in their careers , they have to try new things , they have to know where the businesses are going , they have to be aware of the changes made in the world with today 's globalization .
New ways of thinking are coming , new markets have to be explored and new cultures ( companies ) will try to succeed in your own culture , your own market .

Global competition is stronger now and with all this coming in in just a few months , weeks or days , people have to learn how to take risks in new areas , not just in the ones they know well , because today 's companies are trying to get more of the market .
The more knowledge and experience a person could have in several areas , the better he will do in the way of success .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement shown before , because it applies quite right on today 's lifestyle on doing new things on your job , offering new products and services , and getting ready for the globalization phenomenon that is taking place these days .
