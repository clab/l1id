I agree with this statement .
I believe that in life people have to change their normal habitat and go through different changes in order to succeed .
When people are accustomed to see the same things every day and lack change in their lives , sooner or later they will develop a sense of insecurity and may even get scared to the change .
I am not trying to say that people should make increasing or sudden changes in their daily , basis of life , but instead , to be more enduring and accept change if it is possible .

For example , in the movie `` Homeless to Harvard '' , the protagonist , Liz , was born with a drug addict mother , and a father who does not take responsability of her .
Liz inly faces negative aspects of life and does not even go to school .
For example , instead of her mother taking care of her , Liz is the one who takes care of her mother while being a teenager and has a lack of responsible parent figure .
After her mother dies , Liz is left lonely and the only thing that gives her security is her encyclopedia because is the only key she had to learn , after never going to school .
Liz goes through a shocking change in her life that probably no one would imagine because she gets rid of that awful past and decides not to be like the familiar world she sees , but get educated and go to school .
After two years of studying , she entered Harvard University .

Liz goes through a change in her life that brings her from completely unsuccesful to completely successful .
She is able to complete her dream and what she wanted to do most in her life an would never have imagined .
People who have negative feelings among their lives should use change as a defense mechanism .
People should not dwell among their past or present , they should endure it and seek for possibilities of a better life .
Taking risks may be a huge factor and also difficult because people always see a change as something insecure .
This is why , as stated before , succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
