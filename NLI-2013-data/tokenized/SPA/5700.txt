In general I do not agree with the satetment that most advertisementes make products seem much better than they really are .
I say `` in general '' , because there are some exceptions where the advertisment shows you the perfect situation , which in real life is unlikely to happen .

From the top of my head I can recall an advertisment that showed two people in a laundry room .
Destiny or the same brand of cigarettes got them together , showing in the end that they lived together happily ever after thanks to that one situation .
This is a clear case where they show cigarettes and smoking a lot better than it is .

Another example would be the adverts selling services , a bank , supermarket , a public office , etc , are some unfortunate examples of how the service shown has nothing to do with reallity .

However , most of the advertisments people are exposed to have no other alternative than to show you the product .
So , when you see a car ( for instance ) , you have a realistic and clear idea of what the car is like .

Evenmoreso , the adverts make easier to the buyer the process of the decission at the time of the purchase after having a first visual contact with it through the advert .
Also they can save time once a person knows exactly what is looking for .

To conclude , I think that people should always appeal to common scense .
Think about their needs and economical posibilities , and not get carried away by fantasies or advertisments in the few cases where the advert shows a product much better than it really is .
