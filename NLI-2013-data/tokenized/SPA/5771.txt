Usually , long ago people do not use the car as people use it now .
Nowadays we can not live without using the car .
Lot of people use the car to work , to go shopping and so forth ...
There are several advantages and disadvanteges of using the car .
Day by day prices of the petrol are going up and there is a luck of this energy source .
Many governaments and investors are trying to develop alternative energies in order to improve the quality of cars using those energies and they are trying to promote the use of the public transport and other vehicles .

On the one hand , we have those who think that in twenty years there will be more cars than now , because it is the faster and the more individual way to travel .
They believe that there will be alternative sources in order to satisfy the luck of petrol , but they also argue that there will be a big demand of high technology cars .

On the other hand , we have those who believe that in twenty years there will be a great decrease of cars due to people will be concerned about the enviorement and the pollution .
Governaments will make the public transport cheaper and there will be many new users of this kind of transport .
Maybe there will be a discover of a way of transport cheaper and faster than cars and that can be used whenever and whenever one want .

On the whole , although both opinions can be argued strongly , I really believe that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than now .
In fact , I think that there may be more cars than now , because the world is growing so fast and most people preffer cars than any other way of transport .
