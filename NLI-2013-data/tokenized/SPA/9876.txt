A person that is successfull or wants to be successfull likes to try new things and take risks in life instead of doing only what they know they are good at .
This might be because a truly successfull person knows that an unending process of learning is what being successfull is all about .
When you try new things you learn and see things you did not know about and your perception becaomes wiser , your knowledge is expanded .
When you do something only because you know you are skilled at it you are denying your your chance to explore the other possibilities and innovations the world can offer .

Therefore , I consider my mom to be a very successfull and lawyer and human being .
She is a person that has travelled to many countries , and consequently has been to three different continents .
She has seen many cultures , even experienced many cultures and has perceived the definition of justice other countries have .
She has gained experience because of this and implemented it in her work , she even visited prisons to get to know cases and approach the venezuelan legal system a different .
All of these experiences made her a successfull lawyer that even worked with the government and defended well known officials of the government .

On the otherhand , one can be and wants to be successfull in many aspects of life , especially , in one very essential which is love .
My cousin had a crush on girl for three years and acted like her best friend when in fact he loved her .
He was an amazing friend and was very good in that position , he resignated to being that because he was afraid if he told her his feelings she would reject him .
Finally , after me and his friends convinced him , he took the risk of asking her and telling her what he truly felt .
She felt the same about , so by being strong and courageous enough my cousin felt happy and very successfull .

Adquiring experience by trying new things sometimes usefull , sometimes even a waste of time makes you grow as a person and increases your knowledge .
You more power in your life to make decisions , embrace changes and know what happiness truly is for you .
To try new things you have to have courage , to be determined and to make risks .
In taking risks you can lose but can also win and know instead of wondering .
