Travelling has eventually become an important and popular topic among people because of the benefits it can provide to the economy of a country and the pleasure it gives to the people .
I strongly agree with the statement that it is more convenient to travel when you are guied by an expert because of the following reasons .

First , when you are travelling with a tour guide , you can assure that he will then try to give you and show you the best of the place .
As he is an expert , he is supposed to have visited and studied the city or country already , so you will not be disappointed after visiting a place nor get bored some day because the person who is leading the group is being paid to do his job the best as possible .

Furthermore , the tour guide was hired by the travel agency to plan everything as perfectly as it can be done .
Moreover , everything you will need , such as the hotel , entrances , tickets , and map of the place , will have been booked already for the travellers in order to have a more enjoyable time during the journey .
Thus , you will not have to worry about getting on time to a show for example , or having to find a place where to spend the night .

Third , getting a tour guide for your trip is cheaper than playing it by ear .
When you leave all the details and plans to a `` we will see what happens there '' , the trip may turn out not to live up to your expectations and there are more possibilities that you spend more money than you have expected because of some inconvenient last minute problems .

I would prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than going by my own because it is cheaper , more secure andand it is almost sure that it will be an unforgettable trip .
