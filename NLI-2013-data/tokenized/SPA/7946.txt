I do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The first reason is because you could know exactly what is your schedule about time and places .
It is important because I could obtain , before the trip , some information which will help me during my tour .
For example , if a tour goes through a few museums , I could have information related to artists , paintings and sculptures .
It will help me to understand in a better way what things I am discovering and looking at .
Furthermore I will have a foundation to ask some questions for achieving a deep comprehension .

Another reason to take a tour is I could take advantage of the trip moment by moment .
It permits me to know more new things and cities into a short periods of time .
Therefore I will not miss any detail of a tour .

Besides to travel into a group led by a tour is more confortable because I will not be worried of certain facts , as for example : Booking hotels , arranging travel tickets , looking for the best transportation ways , contracts , among others .

The last reason , and maybe the most important for me , is that this kind of trip allows me to meet other people with the same interests such as to discover new cultures , to admire beautiful cities and countries , and to increase our general knowledge about the world .
Furthermore I cou A tour guide has a special preparation of several subjects and if we have a question , we will have always his support during the trip .

These are important reasons to support why I do not like travel by myself and how much I could enjoy a trip by sharing my time with other people without to be stressed by certain things which could be in the proffesional people 's hands .
