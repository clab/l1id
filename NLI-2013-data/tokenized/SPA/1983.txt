In my point of vew as a young person I would say that , obviously young people enjoy life more that old people do because all the advantages that you have as young person in terms of movement , flexibility , energy to do things , how enjoyable things look to you etc .
Also to me it seems borring how the older people live and this is in part for how the TV and the society present us , ( young people ) , how we should live life when we grouw up , no more playing arround and doing fun things but working and working all day to get to your home and only sleep .

From the other side I shuld n't be able to say exactly which of both lifes are better enjoied , because as I said I am still a young person and I do n't know what is to live as an older man and what activities do they have to enjoy themselves because as all the different pars of live there is alwise something to entretain you , for example when you are a baby what you enjoied most was all the little teddy berars , when you are a kid all the toys and little cars made you enjoy life , when tou are a teenager the videogames came to your life to stop your borring aftrenoons and nights and now at my age what I enjoy most and what makes meenjoy life is to hang out with my friends , have some drinks and arrive late home .

As I said previously futher on in life there should be some other things that entretain you in life and not only base it in work , thigs such as real cars , women and even get married and have some kids to form a family and to able to mantain it and see your children grow , and maybe when you are and old man your entratain would be that your sons and grendsons come to visit you and your wife every weekend .

In conclusuon I woul 'd like to say , that is imposible to determine which , young or old people enjoy more life , it all depends in what you do in your life , and simply that ENJOY EVERITHING YOU DO .
