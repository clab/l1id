I think that enjoying life is not a matter of age .
When we talk about young people we usually think of fun , happines and party .
On the other hand , when we talk about old people we think of , streess , work , family and bore .

First of all , i think that to enjoy life means to do all the things that can make you happy everyday of your life , accepting things as they come , and if we can , making thing better .
What I 'm saying is that not only young people can enjoy life , not only they have dreams , not only they can accomplish their goals .
In fact some young people do n't enjoy their lives at all , maybe because they have n't found yet their goals in life or maybe because they do n't have any motivation to do so .

Second , I do n't think that someone is able to enjoy life more than others .
You can enjoy life or you do n't enjoy it at all .
In fact enjoying life is a question of attitude , how you face the reality , how you decide to carry your life , with all the problems and all the happiness it could bring .

Young or old , I think that we all pursuit the same goal ^ To be Happy ^ , and I am sure that if you want to be happy you will enjoy every moment of your life , doing the things that you like and dislike , making your world a better place for yourself and the people you love , taking care of the things and the people you appreciate .
All those things are a sing that you are enjoying your life .
Whatever you do , if you do it with pleasure , you are enjoying your life .

In conclusion , I think that everybody , young , old , black or white , can choose how to enjoy life .
