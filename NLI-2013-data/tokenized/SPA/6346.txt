From my point of view i do n't think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Even if the price of the oil is enormously increasing nowadays , twenty years is such a small period of time to foresee that cars are going to decrease in use .

As far as i am concerned the car is the transport that most people use to get to the work , the school , the university ...
I am disappointed with this choice because i think the car can tremendously damage the enviroment .
Every day the pollution in the cities are growing and the citizens have the responsability of this .
If we were concerned about the consequences that the cars can cause in the nature I am sure we would change our point of view .
Most people take the car because they think is the easiest way : they ca n't stand the queus in the metro or at the bus stop , they do n't have to fight with the people to get in the train etc .
Instead of seeing the advantages of public transport they only see the disadvantages of it .
However they are wrong because when they take the car there are a lot of people who take the car at the same time , therefore nobody will be able to avoid the traffic-jam in the peak hour .
I ca n't understand why people keep on taking the car in the morning if they know they will find traffic-jam , they will get nervous and maybe they will be late .
Nevertheless at least there are some people concerned about the enviroment problem and they usually take the metro or the bus to move from one place to another .
I would advise the citizens to avoid the car if they do n't really need it .
It is a pity that we are damaging our planet due to our selfishness and carelessness .

I wish the cars in use would be fewer in twenty years but i think this is a marvellous uthopy .
I will look forward to seeing the roads without cars .
