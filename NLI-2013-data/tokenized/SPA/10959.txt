I believe that the people who try new things and take risks in order to be succesfull are exposed to good luck and you should call them just `` lucky '' .
While successful people really are the ones who learn how their knowledege , intelligence and skills can drive them to success .

The diference between people who try new things and take risks from someone who is doing what he knows to do well , in order to be succesfull is that the second ones will manage their success for the long term , while risky ones do n't have the abilities and backround to manage their `` suddenly '' succes .

I believe and example of this is the founder of Microsot .
He invented a new operational system for computers called windows , back in the 1990s .
I do n't think he just created the most important company in the world by triying a new thing and taking the risk to put some money in that business .
What I believe is that he really knew exactly how to change the computer world by adding a new firendly user interface to Personal Computers ( PCs ) , and he anticipated the impact that PCs will have in the life of the human kind .

Also , Microsoft 's founder has been able to be succesful managing his company for the last 27 years , beyond the most furious market competition from their rivals ( Apple , IBM and others ) .

If someone suddenly change jobs or follow a new idea , and from being financial advisor , he switchs to the pizza business and invest all his savings in this new business , and suddenly he becomes the most famous pizza chef in the world and makes a lot of money , i would call this person luccky .
