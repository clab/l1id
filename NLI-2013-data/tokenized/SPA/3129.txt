In my opinion , and experience , old people can enjoy life as much as the younger .
I belive that people can be of an old age , but still be ` young of hearth ' as far as i have seen is mostly related to how the person lives his life and how he thinks on himself .

Many people belives that to enjoy life one has to be young , the truth is that many of the people that thinks that way will not enjoy life when they get older because of the way they think .
As exanple of this i could relate about my grandmother : from what my mother has told me of her i know she always feared to be old and tried always to hide her age and she did all this because in ther mind she was getting too old to and was afraid of being useless .
I have met other people like her , and aging is not good with them .
In the other hand i have my grandfather : he never cared much for his age and always said he was as the wine : ` getting better with each year ' and is truth , is a sense , since even tought he is 5 years older than my grandmother he is in much more active and seems younger than her .
Constantly we have examples of this kind of person , people that does amazing things even at their advanced age amazing all of us , younger people , that cant do those things .

I Think that also the character of a person is very important , some people are jovial and carefree and if they keep those traits as they get older they will be able to enjoy life as much as they did when they were younger .
For example some people say : ` im 55 years old .
Im too old for those things ' others will say ` im only 55 years old .
Why ca n't i do that ? ' and if they dont see any obstacle in their age then it will not be any obstacle for them and they will enjoy life at its fullest not mattering the age they reach .
