Knowledge is a complex process that requieres both theorical and practical concepts to be present , in order to take place .
That is why , I strongly disagree with the statement that indicates it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .

I have been teaching `` Introduction to civil law '' at my university to first year law students and I can assure your that , from my personal experience , students can only understand properly concepts and ideas , if they have an example from real life , from everydays life to support it .

Several reasons explain this situation .
First , students are familiar with facts , because they are involved in all kind of situations where facts are present .
Also , concepts and ideas are necessary in order to understand the facts , but if you do not have a fact that can ilustrate a real situation , then your students will probably forget the concept or the idea , because they are not going to find it any practical use .
As a matter of fact , I have seen that the leasons I give to students that include a fact as an example of a concept or idea , are the leasons that students not only like the most , but show more interest in .

I am not saying that concepts and ideas are not important .
Of course you need to teach students concepts and ideas , due to the fact that an important part of knowledge is based on them .
But , if you do not add facts as a great resource in order to explain a concept or idea , then your students are not going to be able to relate both theorical and practical knowledges .

Bearing all this in mind , I have to say that I believe you can not choose between teaching concepts or ideas , or facts to your students , if you want them not only to understand what your are teaching them , but finding it a practical use in their lifes .
You have to combine concepts and ideas with facts in your teaching methods and that is the hardest part of all , but that is a different subject .
