Students have their own way of learning and understanding , but not all have the same way of doing it .
Some people think that it is more important to understand the facts .
Others may think that undestanding ideas and concepts is a better way of learning ; for me , it is better to undestand ideas and concepts .

Many students say that learning facts is muh better because of many reasons .
Firstly because you are having more details about a topic , by this they say that you are learning more .
Also they say that by having more details , tey are going to have more information in their minds and probably better marks .
Finally , they think that they are better , but the question is : Are you really learning all those details ?
People only learn it if they really like the topic , otherwise , they learn it for some more knoledge that in the end may be gone .

By the other hand , there are students that think that understanding ideas and concepts is much better for undestanding a topic .
Commonly it is much easier for them to have the idea of what they have learn .
another reason why they use to only undestand the idea and concept is because you probably learn for your hole life , for example things that now may no exist more or history that it is essential important for pesonal knowledge .
As a last reason , is that even though you do not have learn all the topic you are certain that you have learn something .

For me , it is better to understand the ideas and the concepts because you really learn from it .
I think that because of the reasons given in the last paragraphs .
Something I always said was : Why are we learning so much facts if in the end we are going to use probably only the 10 % of it ?
You tell me .
