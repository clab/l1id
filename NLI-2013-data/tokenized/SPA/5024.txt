`` Must advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ''

Products now a days are very difficult to be positioned in a good market or in a good level of selling because of the huge marketing and the number of unsatisfied clients , so I agree with the statement that much advertisements make products seem much better than they really are becuase in most of the times is necesary .

Today having a good marketing area in your business and with your products is really important because we have many prodcuts alike and the clients demand a very good product and a new one or a better one in short lapsus of time .
Today you have to have the most brilliant proposal and idea to show to the market so the people will buy your products beliving that it is the best one even though it is not .

The media plays a very important role at the marketing area and that is were the especialists tend to exagerate the cuality of the product making very impressive and clever anouncements that make and play with clients minds reminding the product as the best one because of the good impression they saw or heard or read , it is all about the first impression .

The advertisiemnts job in this field is to compite and be better than the other same products in the same market and to make an idea or an impression in the clients about the product so he or she would make the product it `` s favorite one , of course there are some businesses that do n't need these kind of treaky publicity and they just sell the prodcut as it is , but most of the time it is more effective to have a good advertisement and a good publicity to present your product and making it the numbre one of the merket .

Advertisements make products semm much better tan tey really are and that is were the product makes the boom .
