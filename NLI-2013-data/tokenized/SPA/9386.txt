Ok , in this essay I would like to express what I think about the importance of ideas and concepts in contrast with learn facts .
First , I will explain what do I understand for knowledge giving and example of one of the theories of Plato , then I will use this definition to point out the main diferences between ideas and concepts , and learn facts .
Finally , I will write about what I think is more important .

What does knowledge means ?
This is a question that has arised from the begining of the era .
Many philosophers had though about it .
Plato said that knowledge is organized in the next hierarchy way ( from most to less important ) :

- Procedural Knowledge : Knowledge about a method or a consecutive and ordered steps to obtain something .
For example , the scientific method , an algorithm to sort any number of elements of the same kind , etc .

- Concepts and ideas : knowledge about `` concepts '' .
For example , the mathematical concept of a limit of a function , the physical concept of the atom , the diferent states of water , between others .

- Facts : Some sort of facts that we know that are true in this world or in some realm .
For example , we know that people die , and that the capital of the state of Tamaulipas is Victoria City .

I think that all different types of knowledge described by Plato are important but if I have to choose between concept and facts I choose concepts .
But by ?

I think that concepts are a complex form of facts .
Some kind of relation between facts .
For example if we know two facts : that all human are mortal and that Aristotle is a human , then we can use the concept of `` Human inference '' to say that Aristotle is mortal .

Other examples might have beed described on different areas of science like mathematics , physics , logic and natural sciences .
