I do not agree with what the statement because I think that the young people are not mature enough to really enjoy what the life offers day by day , while the old people can do .

Let 's go to talk about the level of mature in the young people .
Most of the young people think only about materials things like cloths and do not really pay attention on the other things that are present in thier lifes .
For they , how they look like is most important that anything else .
They think that the cloth can define how they are treated and how importan they are .
However , It aspect doe not have the same impotant for a old people who is more focussed on see what are behin the cloth .
The old people is more interested in know the other person and enjoy it .

Another thing that I can mention to support my opinion is that the young people just waste their time without think on the consecuens of their behavior .
They want to enjoy their lifes as they want and not as they shoud .
The old people , on the other hand , have more time just to admire what they have done , they have done everything already when they were young , so their time is better invested .

In conclusition , I think that considering the different interest that move to the young people and the old people , and also their different level of mature , the second ones have more capacity to enjoy more what the real life offer and can be able to notice the beautiful of the thing that surraround them .
