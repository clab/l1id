I agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
.

First , a broader knowledge of many academic subjects enables an individual to be diverse : being involved in different projects , conversations , and work groups .
By concentrating on one single subject specifically , a person might always be involved with the same people , performing the same tasks , and thinking in a similar way .
By having knowledge , as broad as it might be , of different subjects , an individual is rescued from monotony and involved in interesting and dynamic conversations and group work .

Let us say that a student is specializing in biology .
If he only works on this specific academic subject he might grow tired of having the same conversations and working on the same types of projects .
If , on the other hand , he included some subjects on engineering and arts , for example , he would get involved in different conversations , making his life more interesting and helping him grow , maybe even in the area of his preference , biology .

Second , knowledge of many different subjects enables one to know , identify , and appreciate the connection and relationship between different subjects .
This is especially important in problem solving .
For example , a specialist in manufacturing processes might normally deal with problems related to equipment , tolerances , and procedures .
Faced with a problem not related to what he would normally deal with , this person might feel overwhelmed and not know how to deal with the problem .
However , if this individual decided to acquire a general knowledge about logistics , administration , and human resources he might know , at least , what direction to take in order to solve the problem .

Knowing an array of different academic subjects in a broad level compared to specializing on a specific subject , ensures diversity , scope expansion and more developed problem solving skills .
