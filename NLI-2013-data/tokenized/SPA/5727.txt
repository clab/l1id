It is difficult to open a newspaper without being faced with a new comment on what will happen in the future with cars .
Nowadays , everybody have their own car , and they use it to go anywhere .
No matter the distance , they need to go by car .
But they do not have a normal car , they have the best one .
Today lot of young people use their savings to buy a new car while they have not paid their house !

Is this issue really that important ?
It is as it has divided society into two different points of view .

On the one hand , a large part of society holds the opinion that cars are a positive thing as they reduce the time people spend at the bus stop .
They argue that they do not have to go to the bus stop , then wait there for , more or less , twenty minutes and finally get off the coach and walk during a long time until their destination .
Going by car let them go faster from their home till where they need .
Besides , having a car gives them more independence .
I mean , they do not have to depend on the schedule of the public transport when they make an appointment .

On the other hand , others feel that so many cars in the town has many drawbacks .
For instance , the number and duration of traffic jams is increasing .
Not only the big cities support this problem , but also the small cities that cannot afford with all those cars .
Moreover , the pollution is becoming a seriously problem .
The atmosphere is being damaged by the pollution .
So we have to be responsible with the environment in order to save our children 's life .

On balance , the number of cars is increasing each day .
That is why I do not agree the statement .
I think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than today , in spite of the development of planes , trains , and so .
The automobile industry has had an enormous development during the past two decades , and the demand of not only simply cars but also luxury cars is increasing .
