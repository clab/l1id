Only those who take risks will be the successfull ones .
That is what one of my professors in Spanish Economy in my University in my University used to repeteadly say in class .
He wanted us to be adventured , to have the courage to start up new bussineses and , basically , to take the risk to do something different .
Of course not everybody in class agreed with him , as such way of thinking and living has defenetely pros and cons , but in my oppinion being brave and taking risks in life is important in order to find true happiness and be succesfull .

As previously stated , some of my colleagues in class did not agree at all with the professors idea that taking risks is something necessary .
They advocated that people should only do what they feel comfortable doing and what they are sure they are going to do well .
Therefore , not taking risks would somehow ensure your own happiness or sucess .
It is true , they would argue , that it might not be the higher level of happines that you would be able to reach , but you make sure you are not going to fail in life .
This was infact the particular argument of one of my colleagues , who just wanted to graduate in order to apply for a job in a Public Ministry and work there for the rest of her life .
I thought that it was certainly a safe decission , as she would never have to worry about loosin her job , but in my oppinion she would also renounce to her chances of achieving some higher professional goals .

On the other hand , some other colleagues used to say that taking risks is something very important in life , specially when it comes to the economic sector , in which only those who are brave and not follow the rules are really succesfull and acomplish their goals .
From my perspective , a key allegation to support this argument is the fact that important business leaders around the globe are people who took risks at some point in their lifes , something which gives a lot of food for thought .

In a nutshell , having the courage to take risks is not something easy as of course there is a chance that you might not succeed , but the idea of always doing what is secured and not being able to find and try new things is not atractive to me .
I believe that my professor was right and that , in particular in Economics , taking risks is what makes the difference .
