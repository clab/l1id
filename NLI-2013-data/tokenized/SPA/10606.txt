Succesfull people always are researching for new things and taking risks rather than counting only on what is dominated by them .

The first reason that supports this statement is the fact that `` family business '' are condenmed to disappear .
If the family members do n't do something to capt new markets , or to introduce new techniques that make their business more effective ( reducing costs , and avoiding the competence take the leadership ) the family business will end .
One example of this are the families that have been involved in a traditional bakery company .
New oven techniques make the bread less expensive to produce .
New bread flavours make the business more attractive for old and new customers .

The second reason are what I call `` the living experiences '' .
I can mention several names on this essay , but I will mention just only two : Bill Gates will not have the company he has at this moment if his motivation to explore new markets and new technoligies was n't big enough to take some risks .
He took a big risk developing `` Windows '' instead keeping the old way to run programs .
The DOS was leading the operative systems market during that time , but Bill Gates thought further and explored a new way to show infromation , Windows was born .
Donald Trump would not became multi millionary if his quest for new business research , and the evident tendency of taking risks was n't part of his attitude .
His diversity goes from Casinos in Nevada , to Golf resorts in California .
There is a spanish saying `` do n't put all the eggs in the same pot '' ; this saying matchs perfectly in to Trump 's business vision and the need of looking for new horizons .

For these reasons succesfull people is always trying new things and taking risks instead only doing what they they already know how to do well .
