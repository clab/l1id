I do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide because :

First , the routes of the guided trips are general standarized .
The visits and intineraries are already studied and planned by the tour guide so there is a chance you can miss an important site or place .
I think the best way to make a trip is by buying guides published by a well know brand like Lonely Planet .
This guides are full with tips , facts , history , hotels recommendations , restaurants , bars , etc .

Second , in most of the guided tours you will have limited free time since you need to follow a schedule .
For example , after visiting a church or temple , a museum ...
you will only have 2 hours of free time .
I believe that with this much of free time you can slightly see the city .
In general , all the hotels that tour trips reserve includes breakfast and generally you will have to wake up early .
What if I want to wake up late and have breakfast in a typical restaurants recommended by the locals ?

By travelling in a group you relly on other people tastes .
Maybe one member asks the guide to visit a toy factory .
What if I do n't want to go there ?

Other reason is that not all of the tour guides are well prepared .
In my experienice with tour guides I had some good and some bad .
Ocassionally some tour guides even lie or just make up facts to make the tour more appealling .

And finally , what if I do n't get along with somebody in the group ?
or maybe he asks too many irrelevant questions that may delay the an activity

I had travelled in both ways , in a tour group with a guide and with just my friends and a book as a guide .
I find the second more enjoyable since you mark your own pace , intinerary , and the best of all , you choose the people to go with .
