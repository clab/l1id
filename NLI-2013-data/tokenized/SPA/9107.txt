Some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I personally believe that is is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because these are the neccessary sources to understand how a fact occurs and ideas and concepts are neccessary to develop and discover new facts and its consequences .

First , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts because ideas and concepts are the neccessary sources to understand how the facts occur .
When you see a fact occur you only see what happened but you do not know what is the cientific explanaition for this fact .
For instance , if you have seen a stone falling down from the top floor of a building you know that when you throught a stone from a high place , the stone falls down , but you do not why what phisical aspects caused it .
Furtheremore , when you know how a fact occurs you understand better the consequences of this fact and you will be able to pronosticate the result of some fact .
For example , if you know why window crash when you throught a stone to it , you will be able to know that is it not good to throught stones into windows because they crashes .
Hence , to understand the concepts and ideas that make the facts happend is better that to know only the result of some act .

Second , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead facts because they are neccessary to develop and discover new concequences of certain acts .
When you know how make something you would be in possibility to investigate more about this phenomenom and attempt to prove a diferent way to make it in oder to see if the result change .
For instance , if you know why fire on , then you will try to discover other ways to make fire using another materials never used .
Moreover , when nyou know why a fact occurs , you will also know how avoid that a fact occurs .
For example , if you know that driving drunk could produce an accident , obviously you do not drive drunk anymore .
Therefore , to know how the facts occur is very important for life .

To sum up , I am strongly conviced that understand the ideas and concepts that make that a fact occurs is better and usefull that only know a fact as a consequence from one or more acts .
In my case , always try to know how and why a fact occurs in order to understand the main ideas from such phenomenom .
After all , life is a several kinds of facts and you must konw them
