I agree with this statement , but I would like to clarify the term sucess first .
What does it mean ?
I understand success as a moment in a person 's life when s/he achieves a very significant goal that had before , in that sense might be happiness , joy or perhaps money .

After this definition , I consider sucessful people usually take risks and try new things , but base on their own experience and knowledge and taking into account the advantges and the disadvantages that the new idea could brings up .
In that sense it 's not just take risks , it implies a wise understanding of the situation .
I believe it is very comfortable to keep doing the same things that you already know , but at the same time `` monotony '' it 's something that does n't allow to prosper and literally destroy our dreams .

There are many examples of people who had taken risks in their lives and failed , but at the same time you can take risks as much as you want , there is no limitation about it .
I definetly empatized with this point of view , because if you want to be happy or to be leader you have to struggle and get your dreams , they wo n't come by praying or by miracle .

Sucessful people are always trying to be different and looking for new targets with a very clear idea in their minds and with many arguments to support their plans .
Muy last argument is , our life is a very dynamic and a opportunity to create alernatives .

People who have been working only under the same paradigms are wasting an unvaluable opportunity to shine and to achieve their goals .
Hence sucess people area always looking forward for planning new strategies in their life and be happy for ever .
