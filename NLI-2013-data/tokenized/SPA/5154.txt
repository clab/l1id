Have you ever been mislead by a TV or a web page advertisement , and bought something you were not completley statisfied ?
I have , that is why I belive that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , I think this occurs for simple reasons : people want to sell , and internet and TV makes it easy .

Selling more means winning more money .
Acutally , the purpose of advertising is to sell more , they do this by making the pruduct attractive .
The thing is that there is a diference between advertising the product and tricking people into buying something that is not true .
The sad part is that there is lot of people that are willing to risk their reputation in order to win more money .

Latley , buying through internet has become more and more popular .
It is cheaper , easy , and you can do it right at home .
The problem with on-line and TV purchases is that you are unable to see the object that you want to buy fisically .
There are many well known web-pages in which you know you will have no problems .
For example , I bought the Toefl test online , and recive exactly what I bought .
The problem comes when you are dealing something less formal .
For example , if you are planning a vacation and are planning to stay in a home and breakfast , you must check twice the place .
The owners always take the best pictures of their houses and even use photoshop .
Some times when the change is so drastic that you feel that it is not the place you saw on your computer screen , so you feel decive .

All in all , I belive that most advertisments do make products seem better than they really are .
I belive it is in their nature , since its purpose it to sell more ..
I do not belive that most advertisments want to decive people , but I strongly recommend not to buy online unless it is a recognized webpage .
