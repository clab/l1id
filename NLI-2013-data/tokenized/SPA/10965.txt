I agree with the statement because I think that if you only do what you know and even if you are very good at it you will not learn anything new from it .
And I think that to take risks it might not be successful everytime but its a new way to learn .
If you risk and is not successful you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistakes and how to not ever make them again .
So I look at taking risks as a way of learning somthing new .
If you do n't risk your live will never change and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situation of taking risks you probably would do n't know what to do , or what to say , or how to react .

Taking a chance to do somthing with your live like liveing in a different country , with a different language , different culture , and a lot of different situations , its to take risk because you dont know how people will act , or you do n't know peoples costumes , or even if you do n't know the language .
But with time and a possitive actitude you will eventually learn about it .
I belive that opportunity is taking risks and opportunity does n't come very often so I think even if you do n't end up been successful after it , I 'm sure you would learn something from it .

I took the opportunity of liveing in another country than were I was born .
And i did n't really know where I was going and how was it going to be .
But with the time I have learned a new language and new culture , a different way to look at the world preaty much .
So I think that I 'm preaty lucky because not a lot of people has done what I have , but I the same time I took a risk and i did n't know if it was going to be succesfull for me .
That risk I took it 's made me enrich my person .
