A very common question posed by students revolves around what it is better , either having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject ?
Grounds can be held to support any of the two possible answers .
In fact , both have advantages and disadvantages , but as far as I am concerned , to specialize in a single field seems to be the right answer .
I will give three reasons to back up my choice .

First af all , it seems undeniable that nowadays the labor market is demanding for very young and capable employees , usually already holding a Master 's degree .
Neither this young people nor the educational system can disregard this fact , and the Universities must encourage their students to specialize and focus specifically on certain and well-defined subjects .

Moreover , we have to put special emphasis in the fact that recent psychological researches are showing that acquiring expertise on a specific field of knowledge , is a way for people to feel fully happy with themselves .

A third point refers to the fact that studying a subject seriously and at great length takes a great deal of time , and makes it very difficult to deep in any other subjects .
We do not want our students to become second-rate proffessionals in their careers .

To sum up , given the current expectations on the entrepreneurs ' part and thus , in the labor market , it is important for society in general and for academia in particular facing up to reality and encourage the students to follow the right direction : specialization .

Nevertheless , arguments holding the other way round , that is , the importance of acquire a broad knowledge of many academic subjects cannot be completely swept aside either .
In my book , well-educated people need to have a very high level of acquaintance of a certain field ( law , science , literature , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is very satisfactory to devote some time to different activities ( cultural activities , sports , and so forth and so on ) .
