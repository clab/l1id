I agree with the statement , I think that young people enjoy more the life that older people do .
Young people have a full live in front of their eyes and thay can do a lot of activities .
They have less bad experiences than older people , therefore , they have less suffering .
Many of them do n't have to work , they do n't have to gain every day bread .
Even if they work , it 's more like an adventure because it 's their first job .
Most of them are single , therefore , they can make all their dreams come true .

In the youth , time looks long .
In that period , people have a lot of time in their lives .
They usually do n't think in death and they can enjoy life .
They have time to study or to spend time with their friends .
They can make projects of many years and realize them .

Young people have less bad experiences than older people , this fact make the life of young people sweeter than older ones .
Usually young people have less motives to suffering .
If they have a bad experience , they can forget about it because they do n't have a lot of bad memories .

When people grow up , they start to have more problems .
They have to work and pay taxes , later they have to maintain a family .
In the youth , people do n't have to work , they have a lot of free time .
They have the time to entertain with people of their age .

When a person starts a job , it 's exciting in the beginning because it 's a new activity .
The first job is always a great experience because it 's the first step to adulthood .
This is before the experience become repetitive , before a regular job of many years .

In this period of their life , young people are usually single .
They do n't have big responsabilities and they can make their future as they want .

In summary , I think life is better in the youth .
Real problems begin after this .
Youth is the time to preparing for life , also it 's the time to enjoy life .
