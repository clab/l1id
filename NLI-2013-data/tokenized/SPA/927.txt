I disagree , but not entirely , with the idea that having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects is better than being specialized in one specific subject .
I think that there should be a balance at the time of gaining knowledge .
Therefore , you should specialize in a topic but at the same time you should be open to learn other topics .

Gaining knowledge of many areas can lead to what I call : `` dilution of knowledge '' by dilution of knowledge I mean that , although it is true that you know about a lot of topics , but because there is not enough time to obtain all the important information of every subject you would end up with a little bit of information from every area .
Therefore , you would have diluted knowledge .

Having diluted knowledge can be perjudicial when you encounter a problem that requieres you to know in depth about a specific problem .
For example : in order to have a job , society expects you to be specialize in a topic , when you see the employment section in the newspaper you would not see an add that says : searching for a person who knows a little bit of everything .
You would find companies looking for people with specialization of different areas .

By other hand being a very specialize person can take you away from society .
For example , I am pursing a Bachelor degree in Mathematics , and I know for sure that if I only concentrate in learning math I wo n't have anything interesting to talk about with other people who are not in the same area as me .
As an another example , I have worked with people and problems from other areas .
This summer I worked with biologists in a problem conserning DNA , in this case it was very important for me to know the biology involve in the whole process , but I was needed , because there was a mathematical problem that they could not solved by their own .
You could see how being specialize in math , but also having knowledge in biology was very important .

In conclusion , people should specialize in an area in order to be useful in the laboral aspect of society but they should not concentrate only in their specialization as they would disconnect from other aspects of society as for example , socialization .
Also , specialization could be useful in topics that are different from your specialization , because , specialist of a certain area are needed in problems outside specialization topic .
