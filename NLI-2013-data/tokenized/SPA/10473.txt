Of course that a successful person try new things and risk , if you do n't make any change in your live , you always will have the same life , for example , when i was a child my mother only depended in the economic way from my dad , but my mother recieved a extra money from her mother , and with the money she opened a baby store , then 4 years passed from that year until she was aware that the store was no selling well , and she changed the direction of her life and began to open a new store dedicated to sell decoration products , and she began to make popular in the city , and with the time she was earning more money than my dad .
Now by her , i can apply to a university in unites states , and pay my classes there , i could not do it only with my dad money , my mother has given to me a big opportunity .
Therefore , if my mother have n't taken the risk to open her store , she maybe would not have the confort that she have now .
other story from my grandfather , he was poor before he came from argentina , his country , and he settled here in peru , however he worked hard and converted into a rich man here , he started to sell everything , and accumulating money , then he work in a oil company and with the time he bought the company and made it big , he helped a lot of poor workers , because they remembered to him .
Personally i never knew my grandfather , i was child living in other city of peru when he died .
but my father told me good stories about him .
Thus , try new things , taking risk may give a improvement of life and happiness .
