Personnally , I think that successful people must to try new things and take some riskes .
First at all , those people have the chance of being qualified on this specified task , as the adjective `` successful '' is given to those people , they have a particular success on life and in everything they are working on ; with their skills they are able to help others and then communicate their knowledge .
To illustrate this , I can take a specific example ; for a scientist whose studies are based on the biological research , we can imagine that he could know very well how the processus of a clonation works or how to study the consequences of evolution throughout time on the environnement , but what happens if this person takes the decision of making some research about new illness that had developped on some poor countries ?
or to study the consequences of chimical products origined by the industrialization on people ?
Presonnally I think that this person must to take that risk and developp as much as possible his skills , we are talking about a successful person , somebody who is good when he makes good resolutions , this person will be able to manage this new risk , and then be helpful to other people .
I think that people are not robots that can just stay doing the same thing over and over again , they must to discover every single detail of their potential and share it with humanity .
Risk had been created to be taken , the human being is always looking for discoveries and to experience new things .
