I would have to say it is more important to understand ideas , I will explain to you why .

First of all we have the memory problem .
Most of the schools around the world and also most of the universities want their students to learn facts and concepts , and every student is capable of doing so in an affective way , however this is just temporary knowledge , those concepts and facts will be erased from their brains probably right after the test , if not , they wil be there for jsut a little longer but not enought .

On the other hand , when a student understands the ideas he does not have to memorice anything , because he uses he logic to infer things .
That is the kind of knowledge that will remain with him for a longer amount of time .

Second , we have the learning and applying factor .
When a student memorice or learn facts , is perfectly able to approve the tests and gradute , but when this student turns into a proffesional , a doctor for example , if the only thing he did in college was learning by heart avery little concept and fact , when he gets to the real life as a proffesional , he wo n't be able to give a diagnosis as good as someone that actually understood instead of learn .
why ?
because not every case , and every problem ( not just in medicine but in any other major ) is exactly the same as the one before , and most of them are not exactly the same as the ones we saw on the text book or the ones we learned by heart .
So the student , now proffesional , that undestood the material will not tight himself to the definition he learned but he will take into account all possible explanations while the one that just memoriced will see the problem within a fence .

Finally , it is cientifically proved that understand concepts helps the knowledge to prevail with time .
I 'm not saying memoricing is bad , I 'm just saying that it should n't be the only thing to take into account when you are training a future professional , because at the end , the most important thing is not the knowledge you have or how many text books you learned by heart when you were in college , but the way you use all that knowledge .
