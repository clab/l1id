I am agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guied .
Well , at my point of view and experiences I have had , the cost-benefit of these kind of travels are a 100 % people satisfied in all senses , economy , saving time , enjoying as much time as they can , etc .

The guide plan every single detail in order to satisfy customer needs and tries always to prepare information regarding the place where people are going , even if is a long or short trip , a guide with his or her skills will provide with a good plan to cover the most interesting things and places to see during these days his best effort will be reflected in tips from people .

Also , very often a guide provide knowlegde , important dates , cer tain historic enrichment in details regarding the place you are visiting and all of them can complete or expand the travel itself .

Sometimes traveling is hard , heavy boring , we do n't have time to go all ther places we want to , a guide can enphatize you to really enjoy what are you seeing .

They plan the whole trip since the arriving at the place until coming back , they worry for keeping you busy and interested in the trip , since the morning until night , The disadvantage I can see in these kind of trips , you cannot handle your time as you wish , you have to be able to respond to the schedule and the group needs in order to complete with the program , you have to wake up and go to bed on an scheduled basis , no matter how tired or bored you are .
you have to take breakfast lunch and dinner when schedule tell , and breaks also .

But at the end surely you will enjoy your trip with the group and the guide .
