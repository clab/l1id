Have you ever seen on television and advertisement that says that you are going to loose ten pounds in a week ?
I heve seen this kind of adds many times no just on T.V. but in the news , radio , etc .
At the begining I did trust them and I used to buy every single product that eventually will make me loose my extra-weight and make me look better .
But then I just realized that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Five months ago I saw on T.V. an add about the pill of the century .
Acoording to them `` the pill will absorve the excess of oil in your body in just two weeks and you will have the shape you have ever drum with '' .
I bought the pill and after two weeks I end up with five more pounds .

Some copanies make their products seem much better than they really are just to sell and enhace their proffits , but how abot the consumers ?
do they really care about the frustration of a girl like me for getting weight with their product instead of loosing it as they said ?
The unswer is easy , they have the money they do not care about the rest .
For instance , that time I rise a claim to the Company against the product .
I asked them for my money back .
Their unswer was : you should have exercised and not been a cauchpotatoe , the product that we sell is not a magic pill .

In conclusion , companies should advetise their products as they really are .
Making them seem much better is the same that lying to the consumers , and if it is not a maggic product they should advertise it too , so that next time I wo n't be a couch potatoe and I will enroll in a gym .
