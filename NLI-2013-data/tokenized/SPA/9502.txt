I believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .
Specially as the student start to progress in his knowledge , ideas and concepts should become more and more relevant than facts alone .

Even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requires us to learn facts before understanding them , it is clearly of higher importance to understand the concept as whole .
In fact , understanding the concepts is the only way to apply all the facts we learn .

For instance , in my working experience I have noticed how two different persons aproach problems .
The first one tries to memorize the solutions and does not care about the underling reasons of the problem .
The second one reaserches the facts for the superior task of understanding the problem as a whole .
Clearly the second one always comes with new and suported ideas on how to resolve the situation , however , the first one is always talking about specific information that does not help the solution at all .

Another example of the higher importance understanding ideas have over learning facts is the following .
When there is a complete understanding of the concept you can apply the same concept to a similar situation regardless of the different facts you may encounter .
Addittionally , the sum of ideas and concept can even form a more complete and complex reasoning for a wide variety of situations .
On the contrary , the sum of facts would not lead us to the same aplication regarding diferent situations .

The fact that ideas and concepts are of higher value is the only fact students should have on their minds as they progress in their knowledge .
I definatly believe it is more important for studentes to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
