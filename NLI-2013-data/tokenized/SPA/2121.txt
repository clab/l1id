Young people enjoy life more than older people do ? .
In my opinion i totally agree with this statement and there are many reasons why .
One of the reasons is because i think young people have more free time for themselves to enjoy , go out with friends , go out to eat , movies , etc .
Sometimes we think that being a teenager is not easy and we think that the adulthood life is better , because we do n't have to go to school and memorize all the different stuff that we need to know for a test or even a simply quiz .

Young people enjoy most of the things they do , and i say this because i am a teenager .
I love to go to school because i know that even thought i am at school studuying , i know that i will se my friends and talk to them .
I also love to go to the movies , eat , spend time with my family and specially go to church .

Young people have many fun activities to do .
They have alot of free time to spend either at work , having fun or just at home watching TV .
There are many things that i ca n't even think of .
Most of the time young people get involve in youth groups , school clubs where they do different fun stuff in order to not only have fun , but also learn something from what they are doing .

I think adulthood is totally different because i dont think older people have fun as young people do .
One of the reasons is because older people are always working their butts off in order to give their family and kids all the things they need .
Everyday of their lifes they are either working , or doing something about work or home .
They barely have time for themselves because they are too busy doing other stuff .
Some people dont have time to see each at least one time a day because they are too busy doing other stuff .

I think that everyone deserves a time to spend with friends and have fun because you are not always going to be working because sometimes you get too stressed that you get sick .
In my opinion is very fun to spend some quality time with your family and friends once in a while , it does n't matter if you are young or older , because i think everyone deserves some free and fun time .
