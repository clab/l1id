I strongly agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
A broader knowledge of academic subjects will lead to a better understanding of topics and problems that exist or may exist in society .
By possesing an interdisciplinary knowledge of subjects , an individual will be in a better position to understand the complexities of issues which are not static and may involve many disciplines .

For example , a podiatrist who specializes only in his subject will be highly succesful in working with many foot conditions .
But when faced with a specific problem , say an allergic reaction on the foot , he may not be able to find the answer in his specialized area .
That particular allergic reaction may be a secondary effect of a larger health issue , such as a disease that has caused the patient 's immune system to be compromised , or something as simple as a neurological reaction to an unusual amount of stress that the patient is experiencing .
A broader range of knowledge in medicine will most surely aid in the podiatrist 's understanding of the allergic reaction and in finding a solution to the patient 's affliction .

Not only is this the case for medicine or science , but in any aspect of a professional 's career it is important to have a wide knowledge of issues related to his or her career .
A civil engineer is more likely to build a safe and useful dam if he is knowledgeable in the needs of the people , the weather conditions under which the dam will be susceptible and the geographical component of the land .
Many times disasters , such as the flooding of New Orleans , occurs because of this lack of knowledge on the part of developers and other professionals .
