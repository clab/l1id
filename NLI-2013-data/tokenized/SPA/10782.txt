I agreed with the position that '' Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I have several reasons :

1. The 20 Century inventors try new things and take risks

2. In my 15 years of Univerties studies , I found in several books of scientists , Universities magazines , that the people who wants to needs to be successful takes risk , risk in research , risk in budgets , contract , burse investment .

3. You never can to do big money with the regular risks .
Never we can ear about people who are rich whith the regular risk .

4. Old things and no risk is a bad formula to be successful

5. USA is a Country championship in continuosly development new things and take risks .

6. The United Style of life in 500 year adopt the formula '' new thing and take risks .

I have several examples

1. The Industrial revolution start in between end of 1800 and 1900

2. The inventors invent in the 20 Century more things than ever in the history .

3. In the last times the more important example in the Internet

With the Internet the history of the world change :

Because each people in the world can acces the libraries and know about the diferent cultures .

The people can learn othe idioms , the people can buy that the can from all around the world .

And my favorites examples in the Internet bussiness are :

I. Googles , now the cost of this company are Billions of US $

II .
Yahoo , before Googles was the most successfull company in Internet .

III .
Pay Pals , the partners bought this company in one Billion Dollars .

IV .
YouToube , this company was founded 18 months ago , and now was sell it in 1.300 Billion Dollars .

This companys was developed successful peoply trying new things and taking risks ...
