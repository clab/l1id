I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
I think that life is about risk taking and when you do not take risks you let opportunities pass you by .
If you were bold enought to take the risk and you managed to accomplish it in a succesful way you will have gained a lot , yet if you did not accomplish it in an accurate way you still gained a lesson .

Doing what you already know how to do well is a convenient way of spending your life , yet by the time you are older you will realized that you could have made much more .
By not taking risks you are sure that you will not have negative consequences but , you are also sure that you will not gain more that you have in that moment .

It is well known that most of the discovers and inventions that build the theories we use today , were discovered by researches that took many risks .
For example , say you are making a research project and you know from theory that by letting the variables unchanged you have big chances to get a certain result .
If you continue with the experiment in this way , you will prove the result you expected , and will have a research project that proved something that was know before .
This does not mean it is not valuable , on the contrary this type of research is also valuable since theories were made years ago and there may be some conditions today that can change the results .
But what if you decide to change a variable and see what it happens , you might be discovering the cure for aids , for example .
In cases like this , taking risks can lead you to succesful events .

There is a mexican saying that states `` if you do not take risks you have less opportunities to win '' .
And it is quite true since by not taking risks you diminish your poll of opportunities .
It is also true that taking risks do not guarantee , every time , a positive outcome it may in fact turn out to be a negative one ; yet you will not know what would happen until you try it .
