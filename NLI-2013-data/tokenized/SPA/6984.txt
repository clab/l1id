Cars are everthing in this world they have now become the only way of trasportation in land .
This does not mean that cars are always going to be with us .
In my opinon due to low oil production in the future cars will suffere in demand .
Also in twenty years from now other kinds of transportations may be developt that may under take the car industy .
And also cause of oil prices cars will not be used us much .
We have to face the truth , that cars may not always be wit us .

Cars in the present day work with oil .
Due to oil foling in supply the car industry is what is going to be affected the most .
Becuase cars need oil , in order to work and function .
In 20 years many other people would have change to other ways of transportation cause they now that oil will run out and car prices will fall to the ground .
This causing less cars in use then now .

Due to oil distuying the enviorment many people have created alternative transportation .
Some other people will find in easier just to buy a bike or another product to go and work .
Cars are just not perfect , and cause they are not perfect they will disapear .

Due to oil runing out cars will be very expensive cause there are only a few people that can buy a car and but gasoline .
This will bring scarcity .
Due to this few people will buy cars and so causing other ways of transportation .

In my opinion due to oil been such un important for car .
The car will decrease in quantity sold .
Cause of taste of people , price , and other tecnological advances in the transportation industry .
Cars in 20 years from there will be fewer cars in use then now .
