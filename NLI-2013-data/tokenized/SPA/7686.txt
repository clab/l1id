Traveling means that you go somewhere else , usually an unknown place , to see , relax , or to learn about those other places , their history and their culture .
Definetely the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because , it is a way to make the best of the trip and use each minute to it 's highest capacity , because each second that passes is not only worth money , but it is also worth precious time of learning and having a great experience .
When having a tour guide , one can focus on other things like assimilating what is happening ( what has happened in those places that I am standing ) all around , but paying attention to someone that knows where they are taking you .
Sure , it would be ideal to mark your own route when traveling , but not everyone can do that .
At least , I would need to travel a little bit more , to know how to do that .
The tour guide can be of great help when someone does n't travel that often , because , they will summarize every important detail , and help you not to miss any of them , as you go along the journey .
A tour guide is a qualified person , someone who does n't only know history , architecture , and in most cases culture ( they usually have lived in those places ) , which means that a load of curiosities , historic and cultural details go along with having a guide .
Now , the question rises : what kind of guide would you want ?
One that has lived in the places that you are visiting , one that is specialized in architecture , or planting , or churches ?
That is a question based on what do you want to go see specifically .
Each person has different interests , and you may need a guide that can talk in your language , literally and figuratively speaking , so that you feel that your curiosities and questions can be answered and taken care of by that person .
So , in terms of traveling , having a guide can make a trip a more enjoyable experience , and a very educative and interesting one at that .
