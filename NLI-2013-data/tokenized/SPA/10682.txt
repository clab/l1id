I do agree .
In fact I would say that this issue marks one of the most important cultural differences between Europe and the United States of America , and that it is one with enormous economic impacts .
While in the USA there is a very strong culture of the succes , exemplified by the working people whose valour and will to reach as high as they can leads them to a great economic succes not only for them but for the entire society , in Europe nowadays economically succesful people is being regarded more and more each year as demons guilty of the misery in which so many people around the world live .
As many modern european intellectual vices this opinion is very likely to be found ( but more as a trend to exhibe than as a reality ) in France .

I must say that when I use the term `` economicaly succesful '' I do not refer to plainly rich people but to people who has achieved to make money by themselves and by a productive activity .
This leaves out speculators and the like .

I will now justify my opinion on the French : french youths nowadays would prefer , in a seventy percent majority , to become civil servants rather than to work in the private sector .
Being a civil servant in France has even more advantages than in the rest of Europe about free services such as health care or education for your children .

However this way of thinking is leading France to not being able to keep up economically with the rest of Europe , and Europe to not being able to keep up economically with globalization in general and with the USA in particular .

On the other hand once you have acquired deep knowledge about something it seems such a pity not to use it , and the labour market usually demands more specialists than entrepreneurs , and much of the features that make the USA so dynamical in economics also create great inequalities in its social tissue not to be seen in Europe , so in this issue as in many other I would suggest to find an equilibrium point instead of clinging to an extreme position .
