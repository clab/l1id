Nowadays almost everybody can afford a car , something unimaginable a few decades ago .
I ca n't now imagine a world without cars .
I believe the use of cars will never decrease .
Furthermore , I 'm sure there will be more cars in use each year thanks to the development and needs of society .
There are several reasons to think so .

To start with , we all know the convinience of using cars , such as having more freedom or determinig one 's sozial status .
I will give an example to support that they can determine a sozial status .
My neighbour has been earning for some years to buy a very expensive car .
He 's not rich but he just bought this desirable car to make people think he is a very prosperous and rich person .

Another argument is that technology is in constant change .
Probably in twenty years cars will have such entice things that everybody will desire one .
No matter how much expensive it may be , a lot of people will be affording all their lives to get the best one .

A third reason is that economy is thriving all over the world , and more people will be able to buy a car in some years .
I feel that those who nowadays use other means of transportation desire to have a car .

From the arguments I have stated above it can be seen that in twenty years there will be as much cars as there are today , or even more .
They provide us a lot of benefits such as making our lives easier and exiting .
