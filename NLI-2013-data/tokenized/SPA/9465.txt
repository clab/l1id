I think that both things are important for a student , to now factes and conceopts and also to understand ideas .

First of all I think that it 's importent for people to now factes becouse if you only now idias your nouleg would not be complet .
For example I use to only have idias about what arte was and what hapened in general threw out the centuries in Art history .
I allso new general ideas about how art evolved in my home country .
But sence I dident have especific factes it was quit difiult to copere what was happening in Peru when some thing else was happening in another country .
With factes I can compear more acuretly and see thi influences that one had toured the other .

I also thik that ideas are important becouse it helpes a person make there oun thotes obout what they are learning .
This is mostly limportant in clases or subjectes like sociology , history , filosofi , and otheres that even though there are some factes that have to be lerened , if you dont understand general concepts and idias this nalige would not be of much use any were but in clases .

A student is preparing himself for the world , for work , and for life in general .
The world is made of strick rouls , factes that we should now but be nead to understand way the roules are there for , and who does the factes afect us .
A bisness man for example needs to now the pices of productes as much as how to treat his clientes , what is the best way to reach them , what gives beter resaltes .

In conclution I think that bouth understanding conceptes and idias is as important as learning factes becouse we need bouth for aure preparation as good profetionals .
