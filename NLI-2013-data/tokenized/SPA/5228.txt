I agree that advertisements today really try to drag you in their product with fake pictures .
Advertisements today have been a big influence to many people including teens adults and also children .
The way advertisements work are simple .
Advertisements can be looked at like lies just that people do n't know it .

Most of advertisements today have been to promote a certain product or company .
This type of business has helped many people be succesful in their particular goal of reaching what they wanted through advertisements .
Advertisements have been used over many years to pull the audience into the product .
This is the key to all advertisements .
For example if it 's a advertisement on food the picture they show on the food is made just to attract the audience not to really show how the food is but to attract them .
The certain plate could be just a banana but the picture could be edited so it looks very good for the customer to buy it .

Many companies have a section in their company focusing in advertising .
They have these sections so that they know what the audience weakness can be and how they can attract that audience into buying their product .
Another example of an advertisement can be some deoderant advertisement .
Axe has a comercial where the man who uses this product sprays this product on his body .
After he used this product the women would be very attracted to him .
This comercial promoted that it could either smell good or attract many women .

In conclusion I agree that advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .
All this is done just to make money .
So next time watch out to what products are being advertised and know that it can be a lie .
