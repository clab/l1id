A company 's main purpose is to create a product that will sell no matter what ; at least that is our common knowledge .
Fortunately , there are also many companies who believe in making a great product that will be eficient and meet the needs of their buyers .
Still it is not known which happens the most , but it is quite obvious that in either case they use advertising to sell their product .
It is pesimistic to say that most companies lie to their propective buyers to get them to buy their product through great advertising , but it is somewhat true .
There are those that sell their product as it is , and others that sell it by painting it better than what they really are .

I 've actually been exposed to both types of advertising and can say that I 've felt cheated by the second one .
Who has n't yearn to buy one of those miracle creams shown on tv ?
Those that remove scars or make your breasts grow , at least that is what the `` users '' say on tv .
Yet , not everyone has bought them because they know better than to be fooled by those ads .
Unfortunately , I was fooled .
I bought a cream that would remove stretch marks , and was obviously disappointed when three weeks later I saw no results so I gave my dermatologist a visit where he told me that there was no cream that would remove them .
This advertisings are quite misleading and always make you waste your money , especially to those of us who does n't have money to spare .

Luckily , I have also bought products that have achieved what they promised on their adevertismentes .
M & M 's ads guarantee that they 'll melt in your mouth and not in your hand , and they certainly do melt in my mouth .
Likewise , a new so called `` Vanish Poder O2 '' which promises that it will remove almost every stain off your clothes , really does .
Once I took my cousins favorite white jacket without her permission , and obviously I had to drip some blackberry icecream on it .
I got to her house very quickly and told her maid to clean it for me .
Two hours later , the jacket was completely whiten by `` Vanish Poder O2 '' .

I cannot say I blame companies to lie on their ads so people will buy their products , because I have also painted myself a few times better than what I really am , not by saying huge lies , just by improving a few defects .
Still , I hate to feel ashamed for believing those companies , but not enough to damage my belief that not all companies are like me .
