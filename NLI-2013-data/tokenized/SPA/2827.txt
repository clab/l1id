I disagree with that stament .
Younger people do not enjoy life more than older people do , they just enjoy it in a diferent way .
Younger people still have the energy to do a lot of things older people cannot do , such as swimming and running and staying up with friends partying , so they enjoy life with a big group of people , often their friends from school and neighborhoods .
They also usualy do not need to work and worry about payments and loans and all of the problems troubling the older persons , they only need to worry about education and their future , so they tend to play games like football , soccer , baseball and basketball , and have hobbies like swiming and riding a bicycle , going to rock concerts and dancing .
Older people enjoy life in a diferent way simply because they no longer have the time , or energy , to do the things they used to do .
They are too responsible , too caring about the example they set for their sons and the time they give to them , to remember that they , too , need a moment for themselves .
A grown person has to worry about diferent issues , like working and paying for all of the things they use , about not being a bad example for their children , and about their education , among other things .
So an older person tends to have fun with their husbands/wives and children , people from the neigborhod and jobs , but often in smaller numbers , and they tend to enjoy and remember the little details more than the younger people , like that time their sons started to walk , or when they said their first word , or that time away from the kids and alone with the loved one .
They tend to have more patience , and have hobbies such as model-building and collecting things from their youth , and they tend to play games like golf and chess , and they remember past experiences .
