I 'm agree with this statement because in the future there would be new types of transportation .
I also think this because the the oil someday will finish , and the oil will be only for the rich .
But let me explain my reasons point by point .

The first point and the main one for me , is that cars are not very safety , even nowadays with the new intelligent cars .
Only in my country there are 45.000 deaths each year .
This is a big number of deaths , so thats why I think there are a lot of people working in new types of transportation .
And I imagine you asking your self why does this guy know that information , I know this information because in Spain many families suffer the consecuences of this types of accidents .

Another important point is that the oil someday will finish , but I think we do n't have to wait until that day , I say this because in Europe the price of the oil is very very expensive , many people ca n't pay it .
As I read the other day in a prestigious newspaper there are a lot of companies working in alternative types of oil .
This is something that I do n't know too much , so let keep it for the scientists .

Finally I wanna express my conclusion , and it 's that one of the gratest inventions of the human bean in a few years will finish .
I do n't want to look like a dramatic person but the only thing that cars give us are problems , for example many people suffer stress because the traffic jams .
But on the other hand cars also help us now the trips are more shorter than before , but this is only a little advantege .
There are more disadvanteges .
