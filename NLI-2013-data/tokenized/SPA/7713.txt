There are many benefits related with travelling in a group led by a tour guide , such as opportunities to make friends among the group members , and a fixed itinerary which reduces the risks of getting lost .
However , I believe that the benefits of travelling alone outweigh the benefits of travelling in a group in many ways : personal time management , tailored travel routes , and budgeting .

Firstly , it is important to have a detailed plan with specific tour locations and times in order to effeciently organize and run a tour where many people are involved .
This means that certain locations of interest may not be visited or may not receive as much tour time as one may desire .
Locations and time allocations would be based more on the overall benefit of the group , rather than the specific interests of the individual .
Therefore , by travelling alone , one could exclusively tour the locations one is interested in and allocate as much time as one wants in viewing the location .
The organization of the itinerary would be up to the individual traveller , allowing him to map out his own travel routes and `` design '' his own trip .

Also , travelling alone would allow the traveller to budget the spendings specifically to his needs .
The traveller could significantly reduce costs in unnecessary spendings related to visiting areas of little interest , and increase spendings in local food culture or buying souvenirs .
The areas of spending could be adapted to what each individual traveller desires , depending on what part of the tour they want to concentrate their tour spenditures .
Moreover , cheaper transportation and accomodations can be adapted into the plan of an individual traveller .
However , in a group setting , travellers are charged with a lump-sum amount where little room for personal interests and budgeting decisions is allowed .

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
I believe this may be true in the case of people of old age , who are more comfortable with a mapped-out plan and a tour guide leading the way .
However , I believe travelling should involve adventure and discovering places which genuinely interest me .
Therefore , in my opinion , travelling alone gives me the freedom to live the trip the way I want to and to discover the places I desire , creating a much better tour experience overall .
