There are two kinds of people in the world : people who try to find their right place to live and enjoy doing something similar everyday , and people who after having a time doing the same thing over and over , one day they decide to leave all those important things and start again new projects .
In my opinion , this second group of people are the most successful .

People who give up jobs or activities in which they have reached the top or perhaps feel that they do not receive something valuable as exchange and suddenly decided to jump out to other activities are admirable because they have the courage to start over with the only goal of achieve another success in the future that let them to fill their emotional and economical needs .

Of course , the decision that they make is not ease , it envolves a great amount of valour , discipline and optimism ; however the advantages of doing something new again are important , such as they have more knowledge and experience to start , their passion of doing someting that they enjoy make them feel pleasant to work long hours preparing everything to reach a new goal .

Sometimes they have to take risks , but they know how to measure that risk to succedd .
Learning new things every day make them happy and it become and incentive to go further , at the end they become more achieves and proud of their goals .

This is he way for which many successful individuals reach the top of the hill in their lives .
As a result , their accomplish many economical and emotional satisfactions .
I stongly agree with the people who suddenly decided to change their activities to improve their emotional and physical health rather than to live regretting of their conventional skills , colleages , boss or their lives .
I think that I am one of these people and I will never regret of what I left because what I am accomplishing is more greatful and pleasant in my life .
