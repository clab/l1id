God gave humans the capablity to think and to reason .
Eventhough humans earn these amazing qualities , they usually do not know or do not want to know how to use them .
Humans , by nature , tend to be very insecure in regards of making decisions and knowing what to expect from life .
Given that humans are born insecure and do not know what to do , they are forced to be educated in some way so that they know what life is about and apply the different types of knowledge they acquire throughout times .

Society , due to their ambitions , created schools .
Schools are places were young human beings are exposed to a variety of different kinds of knowledge .
As the individual grows , a certain interest starts emerging inside and this is when the individual knows what do to expect form life and what he/she really wants to do or be in life .
Being that humans are forced to receive an education to know an accurate prediction to what they want to be in life profesionally , humans have to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects before they choose a specific subject to study .

Despite the fact we are all born without any knowledge and that we acquire it throughout our lifetime and the different teachings schools provide us , knowing a and learnig about a variety of academic subjectas will not only help us proessionaly or academically it will help us in our daily life .
Eventhough people may not realize it , mathematics , sciences , languages and arts are constantly applied in every activity we perform in our daily life .
Although many adult people that have already chosen what to study , think they are free from using alot of the knowledge they acquired at school once they decide wht they want to be profesionally , school was held for one reason ; making of each and everyone of us better people , people who are prepared to face life correctly and bravely .
