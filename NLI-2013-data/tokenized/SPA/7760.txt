I think the best way to make a trip is alon or with my family because when you travel with a group you need one person to led everey group .

and if you do not have this person and every one want be the person who led is a big problem .
i like travel alone and meet a lot of places in the world make my trips whit my family is good to because i am the person who led them and that 's no problem for them when you are in an airport there a lot of people inside trying leave that city .
and if u are ther with a group is vere dificul the ckeking in the airline counter , a lot of passport a ID every want diferent seats every one ask for the food during the fly and the person who led must be know carfuly each one if one of them will be sik during the fly or have fear , if you fly or travel whereever you go alone is beter you do not will have any problem only your own person other problem when you fly with specific group is this bag 's there a lot of bag 's and you have to put a target everey one write in rigth way the name of person , after arrive to the destiny you have to go to inmigration with a lot of persons thath not good after that you have to go to check your bag .
I fly with my music group and evere family of one of us to london the last year .
was a big trouble with kids a was a big group , after that experiencie i fly alon or with my family may wife and my child no more .
the only way without problems to fly in a group is if u have your own airplain .
but the other way will be a big problem .
