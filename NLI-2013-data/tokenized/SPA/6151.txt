I do n't agree with the statement that in tweny years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

In the last 100 years the growth of cars in use has followed an exponential pace , to the point that in the world today there are several millions of cars in use .
That pace is likely to continue , especially because many countries all over the world still have a huge potential in their cars ' markets , specifically emerging countries .

Some reasons that could hinder the growth of cars in use would be a higher use in public transportation or a feeling of disdain towards cars , which could be derived from high oil prices .

A higher use in public transportation could be result of no more physical space , but that may happen in big cities with a huge number of cars , not in rural areas or emerging countries where there still is a lot of room for cars .
In addition , people in those areas have a big incentive - if they can afford it - to buy a car because , since public transportation is not common and/or efficient , cars in those areas are even more useful .

An increase in the oil prices could be another reason why people would stop using their cars , and eventually stop buying them .
However , we must not forget that the main car manufacturers are already producing some cars that work with biofuels .
Those models are still almost experimental , but their technology is highly susceptible of being improved , so the number of cars in use would not be influenced by high oil prices .

Finally , I have been using indifferently the number of cars in use and the growth rate of cars in use .
It is important to note that even if the growth rate of cars in use decreases ( in other words it does not keep the same rising pace ) the number of cars in use would still be higher than today .
In order to make the statement come true the growth rate in the number of cars in use should actually be negative , and I do n't think that is going to happen in the next 20 years ; the potential to grow is still overwhelming .
