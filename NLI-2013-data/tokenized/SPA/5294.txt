Most advertisements make a product seem much better that they really are .
And there is a reson why companies do that .
That reason is that with more buyers a product has , the more proffits they are going to make .
Producers are always looking for ways to attract more users of the product , and they do so by attracting people with adds that often might not reflect the truth about a product .

Firstable , in most of the commercials it appears that the person using the product is happier and is leaving an easier life than the one who does not use it .
For example ; in an add used by Toyota , the person driving the toyota could have a more pleasant trip and get to places faster .
And they show people in the street jeoulus and their cars seemed to be less effective .

Then we have the ads where only joung and beautiful people appear .
Beer add can be a perfect example of these ; because they are often shown whith girls in a bikinis and guys at a party .
This can measlead a persons thinking , and make them believe that drinking that kind of beer is going to make them feel goos and look `` cool '' in front of other people .
We know beer does n't make you more beautiful and cool it just makes you drunk ! .

Finally , adds never show the negatives effect of using a product .
In a cocacola add you are never going to see people getting fat or people showing a lot of cellulite on their boddies .
And there are the true long-term effect of drinking sodas .
You just see families and joung people having fun and saying taht cocacola is the best drink ever .

In conclusion , we don 's have to believe everything we see .
And to prevent being fooled by some attractive add , we must keep in mind that most companies are not tryinh to give us a better life , the are just trying to increase their proffits by making ud believe the product is right for us .
We need to be informed and make our desicions based on our other options and what is more convinient , not based on what an add says .
