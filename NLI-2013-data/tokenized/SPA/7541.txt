It is very common to see people traveling to different interesting places in the world being led by a tour guide .
My essay will talk about why I would really prefer to travel by myself instead of doing it in group and hiring a tour guide .

First of all , you can easily notice that people who usually travel in a group led by tour guides are people who invest more money in their trips .
That means that the economic factor plays an important role in this matter .
For example , people who travel to Europe and have enough money to pay a guide would prefer to do this because it would save them not only time , but also effort to think how to plan a good trip .
In my personal opinion , I would rather prefer to invest my money in the trip and not in a person I do n't really need .

Secondly , the age is a predominant factor in this decision , as well .
In most of the cases , young people would prefer to travel by themselves to give the trip a little adventure .
On the other hand , it is rare to see old people adding adventure to their experiences .
They only want to get the best of their trip without caring about fun .

Finally , and most importantly , people will enjoy the trip more if they feel independent to take their own decisions .
That 's what really matters on a trip , having fun and feeling free to do what you want when you decide to .
To give you an example , when I had the opportunity to travel to Argentina for work purposes , we were offered a trip to a beautiful village .
It was an incredible place and there were plenty of things to do there .
However , since we were supposed to follow the scheduled program defined by a tour guide , we were not able to enjoy and to know the place as if we were there by ourselves .
In other words , traveling by myself is by far the best decision I could make .
