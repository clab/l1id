Will there be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years time ?
To answer to this question and determine whether I agree or disagree with the statement in question , first we must consider how several aspects of the world in which we live are going to develop in the future .
Factors such as the world fertility rates , oil prices , development of poor nations , technological improvements and damage to the Earth , have to be taken into account .

We must consider how these various elements will change and interact over twenty years , affecting the numbers of cars in use .
It has been proved that world fertility rates are rising , specially in non developed countries .
This means that the world population will grow during the next twenty years .
Thus , probably , there will be a greater number of potential car buyers .
However , if large numbers of the world population remain poor , they will not have access to cars .

The development of poor nations could raise the standard of living of people which are now poor and cannot afford to buy a car .
This means that in the future , large segments of the population of countries such as India or China could be using cars .
However , this process is uncertain .

On the other hand , factors such as oil price increases or damage to the Earth may the cause the human being to focus on other possible ways of locomotion more cheap and enviromentally friendly .
Perhaps , in twenty years time cars will not exist any longer and we will be using other machines thanks to new technological advancements .

In my opinion , there is a great possibility that emerging nations such as China and India will one day increase their number of car owners .
The development of their economy is raising very rapidly the standard of living of their populations .
In addition , their fertility rates are high .
All this combines to make it very possible that they will have large numbers of car users in twenty years time .
I also believe that human beings will still rely on cars to travel in the long term ; despite the improvements in technology .

So , to conclude , I do not agree with the statement proposed .
