I do agree with the previous statement , for I am convinced that people who try new things are able to innovate and discover new trains of thought that would otherwise not be discovered .
If these people only did what they already already know how to do well , they would always experience the same results , feeling that they do not bring much added value to the society they live in .

Moreover , by taking risks and daring to go where no other individuals have gone , successful people are not only driving forces of their communities , but also leaders that motivate other people to achieve their own goals .

I will further support my view with the following approaches :

- Psychological considerations .
- My own experience .

As an Industrial Engineer from the Mexican Institute of Technology , I acquired a thorough quantitative and analytical grounding .
Fortunately , my coursework also included studying behavioural finance , subject that enabled me to find an interest in psychology , social science I found complemented my understanding of efficiency and the human factor particularly well .

Through reading extensively on the subject , I began feeling a particular appeal for the works of T.J. Walker , an outstanding social researcher who has focused on the practical aspects of psycho-sociology particularly well .
In one of his books , `` Riddles of the Human Mind '' , he explicitly entails the topic of innovation and risk taking .

He mentions that people who are able to innovate and take risks in order to achive their goals are usually much more self-fulfilled individuals .
They are also much more goal oriented and able to motivate people more effectively .

In my country there is an old saying that says that `` what one has eaten , travelled and danced is one 's to keep and can never be taken away . ''
This is indeed a wise saying that I myself have witnessed with my own experience .

I have travelled many countries , and in every case I have been exposed to new experiences that have tempered my criterion and made me more open to people 's views , ideas and approaches .
Since I try to befriend people from the places I visit , this insight turns even more vivid for me as I am able to share a much more personal experience by doing so .

During one of my trips I faced the problem of having to deal with individuals who were always affraid of taking risks and doing things differently .
However , after talking to them , I finally convinced them of approaching life with a different view , so they realized that they were able to experience much more personal satisfaction by doing things differently and by deciding freely how to deal with a particular topic .

In closing this presentation , I ponder upon the fact that many of us who work in Banking tend to present our ideas in an overwrought manner , and that in claryfing our views we end up complicating them even further .

However , in analyzing the complex issue of trying new things and taking risks , I also do not want to appear simplistic , but instead try to maintain my presentation candid and simple , convinced of Martin Fisher 's quote that `` knowledge is a process of piling up facts , wisdom lies in their simplification . ''
