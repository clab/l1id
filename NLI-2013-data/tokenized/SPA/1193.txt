Knowing a lot of academic subject or just knowing one specific subject .
If you want to be call inteligent , you should learn a lot of academic subjects because you migh fit in every conversation , but if you want to be the kind of person that is reconize for what they know , you should learn just one academic subject .

If you decided to be the intelligent guy , you stared learning a lot of subjests , so you migh look brilliant , but in the other hand , when you learn that much , you are just doing that because you want to be the brilliant guy , the one that knows everything , not the one that loves what he do .

However , if you chose to be the guy that learned just one subject you migh love , what you do , and you would be really happy .
But unfortunally you migh not look as brilliant as the guy that choose to learn a lot of subjects because when it cames to have a conversation , you maybe do n't know what to talk about it .
Althouth , when it cames about somenthing respect to your subject , everyboby would be surprice to see how much do you know , and you migh develop a invention about your subject because you know a lot about it .

In conclucion i think that it is better to learn one subject really good than learn 100 subjects badly , because if we think about all the invention that have been made for people that know everything about the subject they are working on it , not jut a little bit about everything .
