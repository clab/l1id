In my opinion , is more important for students , to understand ideas and concepts than learn or memorize concepts .
When I was a kid , my sort of education was in a clasroom with my teacher and everyday memorized and memorized topics in spanish , mathematics and science topics .
This kind of education is a traditional method because you go to the school to get knowledge through the experience and to understand why the things happen ?
and not only to memorize 3 or 2 books and dates , for example in the History class is too common to memorize all the dates that happened in the second world war , and now tell if you remember some of them ? , sincerly I think your response will be : no .
This is the problem , if in the school and maybe our parents had taught us , the importance to undertand why the things happen ?
maybe , the young people at this moment would't have a lot of problems and would n't be upset for the school .

If we know utopies about the educational system and theories for example for Montessori or Freinet , we can check that They taugh us that the education of a child ( in this case ) begins in the house and the school is a complement of the education and it is a place where the child development her or his motricity and intelectual forms based in understand ideas and not only in learn facts .

Other example is the Piaget Theory who told us , that the education is based in the experiences that you are getting along your life .

Now a days , the educational system already have changes in our country for example the use of internet , in order to make easier to undertand the knowledge and an opportunity for young generations to be succesfully in any area .

My conclusion is the following : you have to learn everything that you need but is better to undertand , everything that you want .
