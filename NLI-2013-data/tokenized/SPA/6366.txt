Every day people are speaking about controversial topics like this .
Some think in twenty year is going to be a masive number of cars , more than today .
However others think is going to be less .
Both of them have reason to support their ideas .

On one hand , the reasons which support people who think that in twenty year is going to be more cars , they are based in the society , in the way that society is going on .
Each day we are most consumist people altough there are some against consumism and some organization that try to stop it .
In fact young people is worried about to have a house and a car and to be comfy in life .
The announce in televion , radio ...
are making cars publicity brecause car 's company are not worry about people , the pollution , enviroment , roads , safe life ...
and they are only worried about money , to get more money each day , and this is the problem .
They put in the mind of young people overall , feelings to consume .
They want to have the best car , to get the best women and things like that .

On the other hand the others believe on people .
They think the mind of people is change because we have a lot of problems a cause of the cars such as people who is dying on the road , pollution , not enough petrol in the worl , wars a cause of petrol , and overall they believe in the tecnology , because new things are made instand cars , maybe diferent cars .
There are many control in some citys ; the restrictions in some countries which for example some days if you have a red car you can not drive on monday .
There are regulation , and rules like that for exaple in italy .
Maybe people is fed up of these rules and they decide to not have a car .
Also , they think that young people waste a lot of money and they are independence of parents later so maybe in the future there are less cars than now .

In conclusion I short of feels that I agree with people who think that in twenty year is going to be a masive number of cars for the same reasons .
Finally this topic would remain in controversial .
Who is the true way we do n't know actually , but we 'll see in twenty years .
