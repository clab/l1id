The importance for students to understand ideas rather than facts is a crucial point when you are beginning high school or when you are going to the university .
There is a moment when you say that the most important thing is to understand theory , concepts or ideas before you should do practice or practical work .

Personally , I diferred from this idea because I think there are two kinds of job , the analytical ones and the practical ones .
When you work as a cleaner o do some practical work where your physical effort is more important , then there has nothing to do with concepts or ideas to understand or identify .

Nevertheless , if you are working as a clerk assistant or administrator in a bank agency you should know the specific procedures about the job and the conditions that are relevant to succeed .

However , it is true that both kind of jobs needs rules and specific conditions to be done .
In the first case , you will be able to follow instructions from your supervisor and the area of cleaning such as the schedule and you will have to respect the time of your labor .
Imagine you are in charge of cleaning windows in a seventy five building in China .
It is probably that you are a very well calified cleaning worker , because it is not the same to clean a three floor house window than the building in China .
Surely , there are many techniques that can be described in some manual or any specialised book but the conditions about the high and the sensation of the altitude are very different from the ones described in the manual .
Here the point is about the practical facts yous should have to succeed in your labor .
You may read about the way to clean the windows but you will not learn everything from just reading about the concept : you should do the job , you should be in contact with the labour to prove the conditions and everything .

As far as I am concerned , I think it is important to understand ideas and concepts but it is more important to learn facts , specially when you are doing physical work .

Talking about my personal experience I should mention that in most of my profesional performance I learnt the best from the responsibilites in charge of than from the concepts I studied .
