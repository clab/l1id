Successful people always try to learn new thing and tell you wheter or not they had a good experience or not .
Experiences are what you would like to have to get into a job and it is always good because you get to leat something .
You can learn `` that '' something that people might not know about and share it with others .

I really agree with this susuccessful people because I am one of them .
When going to the school you might experience new things by risking yourself and asking question in class in a positive way , not by being rude or trying to get attention from your classmates .

There is always way to take a chance of trying something new because of the things surround you .
Technology is the best new thing in the world , and scientist and mechanics try to do new things with their ideas like the newest car that does n't need you to go and pump gas in it but just charged as your cell phone .

A good example of a rich successful person can be your dad that is working on the computer everyday taking care of his stocks in the market .
He risked himself by putting what your house is worthed in businesses that can really do very well or do bad and lost all his money .

Another example , are the pharmacists and doctors that save lifes everyday by using new medication and work it on pacients to get their life on .
You cannot just use herbs like traditional people to fight the HIV , but try to look for medicine that can cure or technology that can let you see how the virus does his dirty job .

In conclusion , amazing new ideas can come to your mind and it is your decision to follow it or let it go .
But for later on , you might be sorry of not trying what is now conventional and revolutionary .
Do like the million dollar guy , Donald Trumph , take a risk and a chance to get into new things and learn from it .
The bad experiences let it go away , because it is not worthed .
`` There is always something new to learn about '' .
