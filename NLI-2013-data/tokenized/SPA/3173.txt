There are many reasons why people tend to think that younger people enjoy life more than older people .
The two following main elements can be considered : young people are more carefree and have less responsabilities and young people enjoy a better health which enables them to do engage in more physical activities .
With the content of this essay I intend to refute these two statements and explain why I belive older people can enjoy life just as much or even more than younger people .

First of all , it is believed that younger people are a lot more carefree and have less responsabilites than older people .
I believe that this statement is offset by the fact that younger people are subject to mental conventions and a lack of knowledge that does not make it possible for them to have complete freedom .
The classical example is that of an average high school in which there are the popular people , the people that want to be popular and the people who are different from everyone else .
In this typical high school setting teenagers are tortured because they are made to believe that if they do not posess certain physical , monetary of personality attributes they will never be popular and therefore , they will never be happy .
When people become adults and gain more inteligence , they realize that what they were worrying and stressing about is completely irrelevant in terms of achieving happiness .
This means that with that inteligence older people actually have freedom of mind , not to mention financial freedom which is considerably easier to obtain as an adult than as a student or young adult .

Furthermore , it is believed that younger people are able to enjoy life more because they have better physical health .
These days with all the medical and technological advances older people are not only able to considerably increase their life expectancy , but to enjoy a better quality of life .
For example in the United States the life expectancy of a normal male in the 1950's was around 50 years old .
Nowadays the life expectancy of a normal male is around 75 years .
On the other hand people can actually enjoy a better quality of life because of what is known about the bennefits of a healthy diet , moderate excercising and keeping away from excesive behavior in the use of alcohol , tabacco , etc .
With the combination of these factors health and age should not have to be an issue in weather a person is able to enjoy his life or not .

To finish the essay I woud like to summarize that I believe that freedom of mind , the gained inteligence and experience that comes with time , financial freedom and the medical advancements that are being achieved everyday are all factors that make it possible for older people to enjoy life just as much or even more than younger people .
