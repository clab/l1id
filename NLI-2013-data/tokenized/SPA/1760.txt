In my oppinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Personally , I like to know all about a specific subject because in most of the cases it is the only way to understand the real truth .
This real truth would not be achieved if one do not get to the core of the subject in hand .

Futhermore , I think that not only specialization is desirable and necesary for science to advance but also broad knowledge is the reason why during several centuries there has been so few cientific discoveries .
An example could be that as scientists specialized in certain areas and subjects , they started to make astonishing discoveries that revolutionized humankind .

Also , because I am an economist , I feel urged to know everything about a certain subject in order to be able to find the correct solution for the problem I am working on .
For example , I would not be able to explain the reason for the high inflation rates that occured during the last decade in Argentina unless I get deep knowledge about the causes of inflation .
In that example it is clear that a broad knowledge about Argentina , or even argentinean economy , would not be enough .

On the other hand , it should be said that certain disciplines such as philosophy need people who have broad knowledge about many subjects in order to be able to move forward and have a profund impact in society .
\ In summary , I think that specialization is the key to knowledge for most sciences beacuse it allows the scientist to gain a good insight about all it matters about his area of study .
