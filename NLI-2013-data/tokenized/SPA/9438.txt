As in all areas , there are many disagreements on education approach .
Regarding teaching methods , some believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Both teaching methods are highly used in all over the world , but when it comes to my teaching method , I am a clear defender that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn plain and simple facts .

It dose n't require any type of creativity for a student to understand a fact .
Facts are facts .
Facts cannot be developed nor changed .
On the other hand , ideas and concepts require creativity and development .
By teaching students to understand an idea , you are teaching him the why and how of the fact .
You are fostering the student to think about it , analize it and reach his own conclusion - a conclusion that with time , will develop in

Take the example of a teacher who is trying to teach his student not to swear at other people .
If he would tell him not to swear beacause swearing is against the kinder-garden rules and it sounds bad ( which are facts ) , the kid is most likely to stop swearing because those are the rules , he was told not to , not beacause he has understood the concept of morale , or because he regrets hurting people .
If we teach him the idea , the concept about swearing and all its consequenses ( which are such and such ) , the kid can truly understand why not to swear .

By teaching our students the idea and the concepts behind the facts that control our lives , we are encouraging our students to become flexible , analize and have a mind of their own .
We are forstering students who do not only know the facts , but also know the why and the how of facts .
