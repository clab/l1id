From my own experience , I will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reasons such as money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom .

People usually say that money can not buy happiness , but i say that money can certanly helps a lot .
Older people usually have paying jobs that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easily obtain .
One can use money to buy tickets to music concerts , to go to expensive restaurants or even to travel all around the world .
These activities enhance the experience of life .

Time is another good reasong why old people enjoy life more than young people , because when young , someone has activities that can not be avoided .
For example , a kid can not choose to go or not to go to school , the parents do .
Time is an asset that only old people have lots of .
Older people can engage in activities such as art , traveling , cooking and studing because they do not depend of a school or work schedule to live their live by .

Old people also have more experience , a quality that i personally believe that increases the possibilities to enjoy life .
For example , if a young man travels to Paris , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspective of an old man .
The young man will probably see only an old city full of old bouilding and museums , but under the experiences eyes of an old man , Paris is full of art , culture and history .
The old man will enjoy more the trip beacuse his years of experience .

Finally , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older people enjoy life more than others , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decisions in life , this will contribute to a more rich life experience .
