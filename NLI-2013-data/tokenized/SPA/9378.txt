Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?
I think not .
First , because facts are things that can really be change .
Facts are the way they are and there is nothing we can do about then to change then or to modify the things they try to let us know .

In the other hand , ideas , as the name give us a clue , are the things we think or believe about something .
As an example , we all know that we need air to live .
If there were no air , we all would die .
But instead of only teaching this we get the Ideas of why air is necessary .
We breath it , it goes to our lungs then the oxigen is transported to the whole body traveling by the blood .
We can get to know that it is important .

Following the same example , we can find the concept of `` breathing '' then we get all the idea we mentioned above .
With that information we can reach a fact : Air is needed to live .

Another reason why ideas and concepts are better than only facts .
With the first I mentioned we can find out more information than with facts .
Thanks to the concepts , we can understand the way things are , the way why the sky is blue , why our blood is red , how is it that the light is reflected , etc ..

Facts let us know things someone else , thanks to investigation , concepts and ideas discovered .
Someone may say `` What 's so wrong about it ? ''
If we are not motivated to investigate , to satisfy our necessity of knowing , we will only take the `` free samples '' we recieve from facts .
Besides , if we cook our ideas , and bake our spicy concepts then we can find a complete menu of knowlage .
Free to whoever who wants to try it .
And once you try it , you are going to look for it .
It is better to cook thant just to but a pack of cookies .

To make my point clear , with facts we do n't reall y get to investigate or to make a research about things .
But with ideas and concepts we can create our facts , thanks to the information we looked for .
And that is why I disagree with the statement on the first line .
