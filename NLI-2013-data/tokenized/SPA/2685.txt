I may agree with the statement or may desagree .
The enjoying in life depends of young people and older , like elderly people .

Young people would rather to spend time on computer than to read a book if they have had the oppotunity to choice between them .
The most f elderly people might choice to read a book , and another younger people may choice any way .

Young people like child or teenagers migth expect life to show many ways to make them happy or funny .
That is why there are in their minds how come they spend good time and easy life .

They have their parents or tutor support their studies and even support life style and they are not able to spend these kind of things ..
In the other hand , older people should make ends meets to life , if they did colect enough money , or life by their jobs , depends the case .
Most of them have on their mind the way to spend life , that is way , they do not expected the life to show an enjoy life .
They might think to spend a good life trying to enjoy , however it is too difficult , enjoy and spend good life everytime , than the most of young people are able to get .

The psicology of both kind of person are quite different , but in same cases older people could get good life and enjoy life .
Their jobs and professions get to them a nice way to life .
