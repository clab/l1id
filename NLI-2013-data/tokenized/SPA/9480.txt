Personally , I would agree with this statement , and the raesons are fairly simple .
Facts alone cannot help you much , a better understanding of concepts will help in the developing of new ideas , and if we only focus on facts , we will miss the big picture .

Facts alone cannot help anyone alone .
An ideal example would be a detective tryiong to solve a crime .
Let 's say the detective have all the facts he got all the information or evidence he needs , but he still needs to understand these facts and evidence .
He will needs a reason for the crime , an understanding of human feelings and reactions to certain situation because without a good understanding these all the evidence and information are worthless .

A complete understanding of the concepts will help us create new ideas .
For example .
imagine a scientist trying to come with anew theory of the atom .
These scientist needs to understand all of the concepts and reasonig that involve the atom because if we do not understand the past how can we create a better future .

It is said that t make an objectical abservations we should trow all of our emmotions away , and only focus on the facts .
That might be true for machines or any kind of object because they do not posses emmotions .
However , when we are making observations about an person or anything that have emotions this would only cause problem .
Imagine that aperson id being trial for fighting with another man for no apparent reason .
This man should suffer some kind of punishment for doing this .
However , let 's say this man 's wife had a car accident the afternoon of the day of the fight , and now she is in a critical state fighting for her life .
The man who had never had any kind of trouble breaks apart and decides to go for a drink , but he gets drunk and starts punching the man sittin beside him .
Should this man be punish for doing this ? .
H is a critical moment his wife might die .
The point is tha people cannot be judge only on facts .
