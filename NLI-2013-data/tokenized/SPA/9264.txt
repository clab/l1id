In my oppinion i agree with the idea of understand the ideas and concepts than learn the facts and this is because in order for a student to apply what he has seen in class to real work , is better to understand the concepts and ideas so he can convert to the best for the work .

Some of the reasons , first if a student can understand and idea he will be able to apply what he just notice ( learned ) in another way or situation , like when a `` painting student '' just learned that the colors could be mixed to form some others new colors , and the profesor explained so well which types of tones can be mixed with others , and he will experiment all what he understand of this class .

But in the other hand , if the student had learn the fact that colors could be mixed , like red with blue give the result of purple , we identify that the person will have the idea and absollutly the knowlegde of every color , but he did n't understand the real meaning of the objective of the class .

The second reason is since every person can transform the informacion in diferent ways and for some people can be easy to understand new subjects in the class , like the `` history of Mexico '' all the concepts , what happened in the past , but definitly that understand it , get the main idea with their own words , will be able to remember it in the future years .

And on the contrast a person who learned the `` HISTORY '' , is not a very good resource for teaching some other classmates , because is closed to explaind with their own words what they learn , as an example Its me , i can not remember the History complete , due a memorizing moment in order to learn by that time .

So , basically it is important in any school to encourage the students to understand very good the main points of every lesson learned , so the will be able to apply this in a future with their own understanding of the concept the teacher wanted to explain .
