Ther are some people who belive that in the future it will be fewer cars in use that today .
They usually argue that in twenty years we will discover another type of public transport that could remplace the tradicional cars .

I not agree with this optimistic vision .
In fact , I think that in twenty years it will be double of cars that there are in use today .
I think this because three main reasons .

Actually use of the car is not extended in africa , india or even in china , but when the wealth of these countries grows up , the citizens are going to demmand more cars .
In a few years they will be at the same level as Europe and USA , and please note that in Europe and USA we have an averadge of two cars per familly ,

Therefore there is another important argument : the petrolium and gas .
The future of gas industry depends of the number of cars , so they are not going to allow that the number of cars decrease .
Therefore , there is no chance that we discover a new energy fount in only twenty years .

The last argue is the cars industry .
It is a powerfull industry , which provides work for thousand of people arround the world .
The goverments are going to use its influence to increase the number of cars in order to avoid social problems in their countries .

It will be great if we could reduce the use of cars , specially because it would helped us to decrease the pollution on the Earth .
But I afraid that it is only a dream ; the reality used to be more cruel .
