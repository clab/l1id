In my opinion succesfull people ca n't be mesured by the quantity of risks they take , because a man that does not take any risk and focuses on doing what he knows he does very well , can be as succesful as a man that focuses only in taking risks and trying to experiment with new thing everyday .
But using my personal knowledge I can say that each risk you take is an oportunity to win , while each risk you avoid is an oportunity that goes away from you hadns .
As an example I can say about a friend that owned a pizza store , he was always trying new ways of mixing ingredients to produce the best pizza his customers could have ever eaten .
Thanks to his perseverance , this friend invented the best pizza in my city , and after that , with the money he made with the pizza he invented , he tried to invent a snack everybody would buy , and now he is known as Luigi , the father of the Hawaian pizza and the French fries which has helped him to open his own pizza company .

Another good example is my father 's life .
He , as far as I know , was the owner of a great company that used to produce the most comfortable tennis shoes arond the world .
Untill the day he went bankrupt .
His company broke up because , one day my father had to take a very important desicion , unfortunately he chose the easy road and he did n't want to risk a lot .
The desicion he had to take was n't dificult at all , but because he was a person that hates getting out of the road he knows , and dislikes getting into unknown roads , he took the wrong desicion and it led him to the bankropt .
After that he has changed his behavior a lot .

So , as a conclusion I can say that taking risks is the best way to live this life .
