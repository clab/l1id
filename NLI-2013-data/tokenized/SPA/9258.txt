I think that to learn ideas and concepts it is ok but until some point because what would happend if i have a lot of knowledge and i dont know when or how to use it , in the other hand we just cant only know facts because if we just know facts but if we dont have any idea or concept of how to use it , we have nothing .
For example if a doctor knows all the concepts and the ideas you have to know about medicine and human body but never works with a person or does a surgery on his own when he finally have a person in front of him waiting for a surgery he probably be nervous because he have never done a surgery before , but if the same doctor insted of all the knowledge have been in surgery rooms all the time probably when he have to do a surgery on his own he would know what to do but dont know why he is doing it because he doesnt have the ideas or concepts .
But if the same doctor have a previous expirience with people and some ideas and concepts he can do a surgery completely sure of what he is doing without the fear if he is doing something wrong .
Personally I disagree with he preview statement that ideas and concept are more important that facts for the examples i given .
