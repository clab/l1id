Many people really do n't know if its better to know a little about everything , or to know everything about an specific thing .
Sometimes it could be better to know something about everything that you see .
Some other times you could wish to know more deeply about the subject yo are specifically interest in .

To have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be interesting at the beginning .
You can be considered a very wise man among people , you can talk in a conversation about a lot of different issues , in other words , you could be seen as a super student o a super teacher that knows it all .
But when you get in a more deeper conversation or when your are trying to apply your knowledge in the real wold or in the real situations that work can give you , you can get confused or maybe you ca n't seem to find the answer to an specific question on a requested field .

When you get specialized in one specific subject you may not know a lot of things about everything , but when it comes to your field of work you will be the only one who knows everything about it , from A to Z. For example , in a soccer team you can not be the goalie , a defense , or all the players at the same time .
Everyone has its exact position on the field , and everyone has their own chores during a game .
Each and everyone makes a team , not just one player who knows it all , but the fusion between all the playes into one team is the one who leads to win games and to have a great team .

In conclusion , I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to know a little about every subject .
Speakin about our own fields of study , everyone should know more about an specific thing and make a team , in everything we do at work , with the other players to make a winning and a strong team .
