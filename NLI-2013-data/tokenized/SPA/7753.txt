Personally , I do prefer to travel by myself .
Traveling with a group has limitances that I think reduce your experiences in a place you have never been at .
Everytime a person is leaded by a guide , his preferences or opinions are more likely to be affected by other 's opinions and , also are predeterminated by a person that already has a point of view based on his own experiences .

When a person travels by his own , the only way to enjoy the travel is to be always aware of the world around , due to it is a new place and your senses are open to any movement .
It is exciting because if you do n't take care of the things around , bad experiences will happen easily .
From this perspective , there is not doubt that traveling in group is much better .

A group gives you a safety sensation , even if you do n't know the people around , a feeling that whatever happens you will have somebody to share with , negative or positive .
Also , a lot of friends can be made in a group trip , I believe it is another advantage .
It is usually a long time spending together with new people that at the end , you share your new experiences with them .

In other hand , traveling alone is a great idea to make new friends .
Although it is true that it 's only you in the trip , it does n't mean that it is only you at the places you are visiting at !
Also , at the end , you will share your experiences with other people and the most important , other 's will share experiences quiet different from yours .
As far as you are willing to meet new people and know different places , a predeterminated group is not necessary to enjoy a trip .

In regards of the tour guide , from my standpoint , learn and search information by myself is the most reachness way to expand your knowledge about a new place .
A tour guide will only tell you typical things , memorized information from a book or a little guide .
Then , if I just want to know general things , I do n't need a guide , I need a book .

Traveling by your own , you need to get information , maps , places and people .
However the difficult but also the most rewarding part is not to have the data , is how to get this data .
Due to there is nobody that will provide you all the instructions for the next day , schedules and rules , it 's necessary to create yours .
Creativity is the most important ingredient in a succesful trip , you need to define what to see , when to be there and how to enjoy it .

Besides , traveling in group is much more expensive than traveling by your own , and in fact , it has sense .
If you want somebody to be your tour guide and a complete schedule of your next days activities , you have to pay for it .

In conclusion , a traveling experience is much more appreciated when it is created by the person , it is a way of live a trip even before you leave home .
