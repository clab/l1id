It is known that several products do n't fulfil all the requirements , which have been presented by saling of these products .
Therefore , I agree with the idea that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
However , I can understand the reasons because these products have been produced and saled on that way .

The economical system of the most countries in the world is the capitalism .
In this system people have to earn their own money by buying products or by doing an activity or work .
That means there must be some people to sale products and other ones to buy them .
If nobody buys a particullary thing , the market will stop producing that object .
The production of that thing would be wasting money .
Indeed , the best way to make money must be found .

Because of this , the trade of products became important and the market could be invented .
Its development helps the politico-economical situation of each country .

On the one hand , there must be the posibility to buy necesary products like food and clothes .
Offering the necesary products with acceptable prices , the market gives facilities to get these products in accesible places ( e.g. food stores ) .

On the other hand , it is not possible that every store sales similar products .
Therefore , the market tries to discover new products which have to get necesary in the new society .
This opens the posibility to create new articles and activities .

Altrough the human society is changing and new products are being invented , people do n't buy all the products , because they are n't convinced of the quality .
Perhaps they do n't realize the advantages of having that new product .
Therefore , advertisements have to present the products on way that convice the persons to buy them .

I can understand this situation in the market and I think that this way is sometimes necesary to keep the economical situation of a country stable .
