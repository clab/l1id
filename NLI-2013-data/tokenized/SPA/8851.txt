Nowadays the students are based on the believe that the know anything , they do not listen their parents , and a bad behavior is noted by them .
I think that students preffer understand ideas and concepts because for a student that is frecuenly a teen agger its better lear the ideas and develop that ideas and concepts .

In some cases the students preffers the facts , because like i said before students are teen agger and we have to know that is the basic of anything .
I said that are another cases because like she used to said my grandmother `` we learn of hit '' .
We can say that a student is know that he ca n't pass one subject he start to worry about and until this happened he is not really that he has to study a stay in class .

The facts in some cases are needed to , thats the reall test for the student , if he ca n't do what he want to do , what can he do ?? , for other hand are some students that are very applicated and they do not need the hit to understand the main ideas and concepts that a teacher explain .

When i was 15 years old , i always was the kind of student that know everything and that i can always do anything and i always believe that i was the better , one teacher , put me back on earth , because i have to graduated not happy , for all the work that i had to done , that subject takes me 2 years to pass , and then was when i noted that for the university i have to understand concepts an ideas and not hited me again like i did when i was a kid .
