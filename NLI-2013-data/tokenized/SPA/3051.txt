I cannot agree with this statement for one simple reason : in my opinion , both youth and elderness are enjoyable if you are able to see the advantages of each age .
Happiness does not depend on age , but on a cumulus of decisions that make each indivudal 's life enjoyable or hateful .

Pleasures can be found at any age , it is just a question of finding them .
Many elders enjoy life despite the physical constraints imposed by age while many young people waste their life thinking on how life is horrible eventhough they have all the opportunities to change their personal lifes and their environment .
Although it is a common place , we should never forget that as long as the heart is young , the physical age is not a relevant factor .

One of the clearest examples of how life is nice at any age is travelling : almost everybody loves it and can be done by both young and old people .
At travelling , young people tend to walk a lot , visit museums , go out in the night and sleep for short periods of time in the same day .
This rythm is unsustainable for the average elder .
However , the elder may find pleasure on more refined activities ( such as eating in expensive restaurants , sleeping in comfortable hotels or luxurious tours through important zones ) that many young people cannot afford .

This example may suggest that the less enjoyable period of life is what is known as the `` productive life '' , which tends to go from university graduation to retirement .
However , the productive life offers many rewards too : having children and professional development are probably the two most known examples .
To summarize , I want to mention that life can be enjoyed regardless of age ; happiness is probably the last decision an individual can take in this age when there is nothing to discover and everything is sold in supermarkets .
