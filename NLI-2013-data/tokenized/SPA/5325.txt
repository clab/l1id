I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Is n't that what advertisiments are supposed to do ?
To begin with , advertisements and publicity are very strong tools that companies have to make their products know .
Moreover , they will do anything they can to attrack consumers and influence them to buy more of their products .
That 's why advertisiments will show them as a unique and esential thing that we shoul all have , implying for example , that if you wa n't to be successful you have to buy the new Dell Laptop .

In many ocassions , products look a lot better in the advertisements than in the stores .
For example , it is common to watch a TV advertisement on some brand of trousers and inmediately think you would love to wear them .
But then when you get to the store and you see the real thing you sometimes get dissapointed .
The situation gets worse when you try them on and confirm what you have already guessed : they look awfull on me .

Another reason for products to look better than they really are , is that many times , radio and specially television advertisement stars one ore more celebrities or respected members of the community who state that they use a certain product .
This gives you the feeling that the product is one of high quality and that it promotes positive values .
For example , if Tiger Woods uses Nike golf clubs then they must be the best .
Or maybe if the prince of Wales says he uses Dunlop deodorant and he feels satisfied with it , then we will assume the product does n't harm the enviroment .
