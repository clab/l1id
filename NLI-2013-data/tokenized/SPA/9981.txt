I agree with that statement because innovation , experimentation are part of the risk people need to take in order lo learn new things .
If we keep doing things the old way is not room for improvement , knowledge , advance in technology just to name a few , and it will be no progress at all .

In order to succed we need to keep looking for new alternatives that allows us to grow fast enough as the rest of the sciencies , like for example when Sir Isaac newton created the ligth bulb was after many attempts his mind was hungry to discover new things .
if he did not take a risk and keep on trying we will be still using candles to illuminate our homes .

In the same way construction companies they have to keep loking for better solutions for all the housing problems , every day is a new and advance equipment in the market that will help them to provide to the population a safer , confortable , affortable and prettier look to the construction .

Not so far down , what about the medical advance we have now and all of that thanks to people that does investigation even though sometimes they are expossed to several degrees of pressure , but at the end everything is for our own good as a society , for the better future .

No to mentioned poor people that were idealistics and started a bussines just based in hope and nowdays they are veryr succesful in wathever they decided to do like for

In general terms i believe that the person that does not take risk is loosing somenthing whether is an opportunity to grow , to succed , to create , etc.in my country we have a popular saying that says that if you do not risk an egg you would not get a chicken !!!
