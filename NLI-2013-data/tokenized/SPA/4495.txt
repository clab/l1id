The question being raised is if I agree or not to the idea that advertisements make a great impact in products .
This is an important issue to consider because advertisement is part of our daily life .
Today if you want to sale any product you most think in how to advertise it .
I totally agree that a good advertisement in front of your store help your business to attract more people .
In order to have this product sale you most develop a good strategy , and follow some rules .

First of all , to sale products you need good avertisement and a good strategy .
That definitly will attract other people to your business , and it will help you to give a presentation of your products .
For example , if I have a store that sale house ornament , it is necesary to have all kinds of neon sings that make allusion of the product on sale .
Other way is to bring some ornaments outside the store and let people who pass by stop and take a close look .
This is an strategy that every one can practice .

Furthermore , to sale product and make then look bettter than they realy are , you do not have be unthrusful .
Instead , you just have to follow some rules that are applicable to every business , small or large .
The first thing is to put the nicest product at the entrance of the store .
This way people will be attracted to the rest of the products .
I remember one time I was tried to make a garage sale .
At that time what I did was just to follow the old rule .
My neighboords started to came , and at the end of the day every thing was sold .

After all , I agree with the statement that advertisements make product seem more attracted .
Even though some people believe they do not needed to sale a product , I would never have good resolt in my little business experiences if I did not used a plan and follow some rules .
