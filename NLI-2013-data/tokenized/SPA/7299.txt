Since most people travel to unknown places and most of those beautiful places have some historical o cultural background , I strongly support the idea of traveling guides .

In fact , by having guides in any travel we do n't have to worry about where to go or expending much time in only one place .
I remember when i went to Peru ; I can imagine going there without a Peter that was his name .
Peter is a native person living close to Machu-Pichu ; at the beggining when he offered his services as aguide , I was not sure of our need opf his help ; but later on I not only new about the importance of him that they , but also the need of his nice service .
Indeed Peter directed us throght a pathway that only natives know ; we were able to see the most wanderful landscape where the Incas where living on and also we did n't waste time since Peter knew how long it takes for a turist to go aroud the such a wonderful place .
Furthermore , we were lucky to have them showing us what the place we were visiting were used for , by the Incas ; but he gave us a nice speach of history and culture .
Even people who were born in Peru use to have him as a guide or other one ; because they know of the benefit of it .

It is also know by turist that some danger could be around when visiting some places ; when you have a guide it is less frequent to get into those troubles , since most guides know very well the place and they will take any step to keep us healthy .
for example by that time I read about a tourist from europe who was robed while walking around .
another case is one that happended to a lady who had an accident after falling from the hill , she wanted to cut the path way to arrive early but because she did n't know the place she took a wrong way .
There are many other examples in my mind not only from this specifically one but much many others .

Finally , I find very enjoyable meeting people during my travel adventures .
And the main person I use to socialize with is a guide .
In fact I am a sociologist and my life is all about meeting asll kind of people with different costums and backgrouds , listening to them about their adventures and experiences with other turists .
i thing guides are amazing people who get easily along to different people from different cultures .
Guides also are very educated people .
Indeed most speak 2 , 3 or more languages .

in summary , guides are not only important to have a nice trip , but they make our vacation unforgetable ..
They represent other culture and we can get a lot of knowledge from them .
I would recommend that any person going in a trip use a guide if they want to have a fun and easy trip anywhere .
thanks .
