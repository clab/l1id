In my opinion neither young nor older people enjoy life more than the other , they enjoy it from different perspectives .

Older people enjoy life in a more relaxed perspective , they know what life can offer , they have made choices and they have dealt with the concecuences of their actions .
They can now enjoy their successes and have come to accept their errors .
Older people can enjoy the company of their families and they can observe their young grandchildren grow without having to worry as much for their future as they did with their own children when they were responsible for their successful education and upbringing .
Since they are aware that their time is limited they place more attention to those things that are most important or personally rewarding , which allows them to be more at peace with themselves and enjoy life without so much stress .

Young people enjoy life in a more passionate manner , they are starting their life and have a great number of opportunities in front of them .
They have the energy to engage in a large amount of activities and there is always excitement in doing something for the first time .
Young people know that they might make mistakes , but they are confident in having enough time in life to correct their errors or to change their behaviour , point of view or activities in order to have a better lifestyle .
When you have the energy of a young person and your future is still promising and unknown you are more willing to trying new things , experiencing life from different angles and this makes life more exciting and appealing .

Older people could benefit from the exciting approach to life that young people have in order to continue taking advantage of life , at the same time young people might imitate older people in order to mantain better human relationships with their friends and family .
Sometimes older people lack the energy and enthusiasm to undertake new adventures and their only experiences are those from their youth .
Young people often live life to quickly , without taking enough time to fully appreciate their experiences , which can lead to missing important moments in their life .
