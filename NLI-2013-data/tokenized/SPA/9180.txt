Of couse , i am agree !
Because if someone undertand the conceps must undertand the facts .
If a person only learn facts it will be only a dadta base , it will not have a logic reasoning or brain storming .

In a part its important to learn all the facts about a subject .
Meanwhile you can describe it but , not analze it .
This is extremly important to student , espacially for a investigation or a speech .
Cause undertanding a theme is the base of education , and science and many diciplines more .

To undertand something , a person learn first the facts , them put on test ande theorize and finaly goes for a conclusion .
This is learning exploring facts and deatails to make a comprenshion of a study object .

For example the statement on my left view begings with a universal condition , than means that is a deductive ideal .
the part saying Undertand realiy means `` knowing everything '' and the fact means `` knowing a few . ''

`` It is more important to undertand ideas and concepts , than learn facts .

The pasage cantains a view Logic order , is almost undenailble to destroy it .
Not only that also express tan a Student must visualize problems and solve them .

in a conclusion the statement it 's a invitation to Kow eveything , to explore athe world of knolege .
Every student hope to achieve that in all clases and thinking of than I believe than I going righ way .
