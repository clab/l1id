When traveling , people always try to plan everything they can .
They look for the best city to visit , the perfect hotel , the cheapest plane tarif , and the greatest activities to do while being there ; but sometimes planning all this by your own can be a little bit difficult .
That is why , I will recomend to all the travelers looking for an adventure , to try a new experience , by letting a tour guide show you and another bunch of people all the things a new city could offer .

When a person is in charge of guiding you through a city you are not familiar with , you can be sure , that guide will show you the most interesting places , will take you to the important museums , will point all the monuments , and in the mean time will explain to you everything there is tho know about the city and its history .
It is a great opportunity for a person that actually knows the place to show you arround .

In this kind of travel , you will have to adjust to a strict schedule , where you will even have an specific time for breakfast .
You have to take into account that having a schedule is not always a bad thing , as it will enable you to use all the time you have wisely .
If you are one of those who can wake up at 7AM , have a day full of activities , go to bed at 11PM , and be ready the next day to start all over again , this kind of adventure is for you .

If you are traveling with your family , there is always a time during the trip you want to get rid of one or two members of the family .
That is why if you travel in a group , you will have the opportunity to interact with people from different places , different cultures , and the most important , from different families .
You can have a trip two weeks long , without getting bored , as there will be always someone new to talk to .

A lot of parents when taking their family to vacations , have the worry that something may go wrong , or that someone may not like what they have planned .
When going with a tour guide , you have someone you can rely on , someone that has to solve any problem it may occur ; and if anyone does not like what was planned , you can always blame the tour guide .

Having a tour guide can be an excellent choice , if you choose an excellent tour guide .
Be aware that there are millions of options in every country you may want to visit , so be sure to evaluate all the alternatives , and to choose the one that best suits you .
