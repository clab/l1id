Life is not a one subject thing .
As I learned during my high school , we need to have a broad knowledge , to see things as a whole .
In life everything is a consequence , interrealtions between different areas of knowledge .
You shouldnt limit yourself to one area .

I studied in an Interdisciplinary program , which has as main objective to see knowledge as a whole by making conections between differents subjects having as main axe History .
I found it so much more interesting this way .
You can understand why things happened , per example the relation between music , art and war in the second half of the XX century .
If you see each of this areas alone , you will have an incomplete version , because you are taking the situations out of their context .

Also if you focalize your stuides in only one area .
You are limitating your vision of the world .
Because there is no point in knowing everything about one topic .
You will be missing so many things .
In my case , I like more than one subject .
I dont want to choose only one .
Why are we forced to specialize in one subject , if at the end we will need more than one .
Thats why i decided to follow a university carreer in which i can choose any class that i like , regardless the area .

Another example of why we should know about several knowledge branches , is when we interact with people , per example in a dinner .
A person who only knows about one topic will be bored .
But if everyone knows a little about different areas , they can have an interesting conversation in which everyone can interact and discuss .
Touching different topics avoiding monotomy .

I believe you need all types of knowledge per example Math , that is one of the subjects that is usually disliked .
If you go to the supermarket you need to know to make sums , to at least be able to make the numbers .
You will face huge difficulties in life if you dont know at least something from every subject .

I believe everyone should be able to have a conversation in more than one topic .
I believe that only the difference will help you broad your mind .
And making connections helps to understand life better so you will never get bored .
