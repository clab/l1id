Whether having broad knowledge of many topics is better than specializing in an specific one is not an easy question , and often , not even our choice , since it 's determined by our education .
Even though it 's an issue applicable to all fields in life , I 'll narrow it down to a professional point of view , and how being a very specialized person can be very positive at work , but can also significantly damage your career path .

The best way to start the discussion is by illustrating the issue with an example which I 'm relatively familiar with .
There are many companies currently developing new mobile phone networks , which results in an enormous investment in highly qualify telecom engineers .
The market value of an experienced engineer in `` 3G '' network deployment can be measured in terms of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The learning and development opportunities , as well as the earning potential , are very attractive .

On the other hand , there are other telecom professionals who rather have a slower progression by broadening their knowledge .
`` In order to be prepared for the future changes , it 's better to know a bit of everything '' , would be their milestone .
They may not be so successful in 3 years time , but when the development of the new technology starts to die off , the knowledge and expertise they 've acquired in other fields will open them doors that wo n't be available for those who specialised in that one specific subject , which is no longer `` fashionable '' .

These advantages and drawbacks can be extended to all aspects of life .
A case that will sound familiar to everyone is that smart member of our family who can talk about everything , but when you ask him for deeper detail on certain topic , can only give vague responses .
This is one of many examples that can be found in real life .

As I said at the beginning , having a very broad range of knowledge is often dictated by our education to a certain extent ; but we 'll always have the option to specialize in a more specific topic , or guide our knowledge to a more open and general approach , by spending as long as we possibly can studying about it .
