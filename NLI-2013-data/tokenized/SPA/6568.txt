I am agree with the idea that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today for differents reasons .
First , people are more concerned about the pollution on the environement than years ago , and they see as problem that we have with the higer temperatures since few years ago .

Some people made the decission to use the car only for a specific and relevants situations .
They use the public transport to go to work , they discoverd that with bus or metro they arrive faster , and they above the trafic in many cities .

Second , health on sociaty it is every day more important .
Many people use a diferents ways to try to be feet on their daily week .
It is became more popular use the bike as personal transport .
In many european cities as Dublin , Barcelona , Paris ...
Goverments ate concerned and the are preparing the streets for people who use the bike .
Also it is a good idea for have less pollution on the cities and trafic more fluent .
Other people prefer to walk or runn when they go to work and they dont have to use the car , they keep feet without of cost .

It is a big descision when you decide to buy a car .
They are very nice and handy bThey are very expensive thing to have .
Cost a lot money the insurance and petrol , it is other reason for why I think in twenty years we will have less cars on the streets .
