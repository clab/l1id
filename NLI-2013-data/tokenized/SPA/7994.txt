I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion the best way to travel is alone by yourself .
Travelling alone you can wander for many places knowing the culture of the place that you visit .
Also you can spend your time with native people who show you the identity of such society .

When I go abroad I try to travel alone because you can know the culture and the way of life of the people .
If you travel with a tour guide you could probably know about the history of the place or other topics that you can read in a book .
When you travel alone you can wander for several places not only to the common places such as landscapes or museums .
You can walk throughout the city without a fixed schedule visiting the places that you want .

I like to travel alone instead of travel in a group .
If a travel alone I can spend a lot of time knowing native people .
I can share their customs or their way of life and learn the native language as well .
When you travel in a group you should do anything that the majority want .
If you travel in groups you would spend more time with your group than native people .
I have visited several countries and I have tried to spend most of my time with native people .

I believe that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guide or travel in a group .
If you travel alone you can learn the culture of such place like a native .
You can know many issues that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group .
I like to travel alone because I can spend a lot of time with native people knowing their problems and thier way of life .
Therefore , I prefer to travel alone by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
