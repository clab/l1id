The art of making advertisements is one of the most important things to sell a product nowdays .
People of this century is really involve in the advances of tecnology ; so , instead of reading a book , most of us are watching television or navegating by internet .
This tecnologies , and also the street , is full of advertisements and we ca n't avoid seen or listenining them .

As I said before , we are all the time in touch with advertisements and I think that this way of salling a product is the one that gives more benefits to a company .
Thats why I agree that companies do their best to announce their products in the andvertisements better than they are .

For example , you can see and advertisement of a shampoo that sais that it would `` leave your hair very straight and soft '' as the model that they show .
As a fact , you can be sure that the moldel did n't only use the shampoo to look beautiful , but the company needs to reflect how people wants to look like and they will use other products to get the best impression on the audience .

We have to be very careful with advertisements because as I said , in most of the casses they are not showing the truth .
Most of the time are a strategy of marketing of the product and , if we are clear about it , we wo n't get dissapointed when the product do n't have the quality that the advertisement shows .
