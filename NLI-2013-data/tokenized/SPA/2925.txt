I completelly disagree with this statement .
But before supporting my opinion I should define what I understand for enjoying life .
For me enjoying life means selfawareness , being aware of what we have and being able to feel pleased with it .

According to my definition of enjoying life , the only requirement to do it is to have awareness .
That means that not only young people can do this .
Adults could enjoy much more than young people .
After all , they have accquired more experience during their lives and have gain more independency .

People with more experience have , generally , a clearer idea of what they want and are in a more settled-down possition .
While young people are just about to discover theirselves , and their sort of freedom cause a lot of anxiety .
They are not sure what they want for their lives .
They have to live day by day trying to find out wheter they want to study or not , where they want to live , etc .
And this kind of situation brings them sometimes more stress than pleassure .

Young people have yet a lot to learn , about their lives and themselves .
There is a well-know quotation that says that we do not value what we have until we have lost it .
This usually happen to young people who , for instance , do not value their time living with they parents , thinking that life would be much easier or better by their own .
And after they lost their parents , they regret not having enjoyed more time with them .
Once again , if you are not aware of something , if for some reason you cannot value it , and this reason could be lack of knowledge or experience , how can you enjoy it at the most ?

In conclussion , I believe everyone can enjoy life as much as anyother .
It is an individual task and has nothing to do with the age , sex or culture .
It is important for me to explain that with the examples I gave before I am not saying that adults actually do enjoy life more .
