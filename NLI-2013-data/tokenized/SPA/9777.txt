I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It is interesting to observe successful people , they always try to invent new things , invest in new business , practice different sports , help their children to improve their lives by placing them in excellent schools , universities , making their children to practice sports , learn different languages and in that way they are going to continue being successfull and perhaps their children continue with them hand to hand in their journey and by doing these they feel even more successful .

For a Successfull person there is always a chllenge , a risk that has to be taken in order to continue his or her legacy , interesting or not that is the way they keep it up in order to gain , win and have success , and feel they are above of everyone .

We have to remember that these people already won and that perhaps , they think , that they have nothing to lose by trying new things , and by taking new risks , that is why they continue being on top of the would by their positive attitude and their challeging ideas .

We also have to remember that eventhough they are successful they can also make mistakes and lose everything they have accomplished throughout their lives ..
but it is in their attitude , specially positive attitude that makes them recover eventhough going against all odds and eventhough they do not recover from one , two events they will take this new challenge again , and risk .

We have to think that we are all successful people because we are , we are healthy , we have a job , we know a different language which give us different and more challenging opportunities that at the end are going to help us even more in order to help others to be successful as well .
