Nowadays students do n't want to do too much effort learning topics .
Despite that thought , I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts .

One of the reasons for students to clearly understad ideas and concepts is motivation .
If sudents understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated .
For example , in Anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done .
later on , they will be able to understand the importance to eat healthy .
Even more they will be encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food .
The students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eat healthy .

Another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is easier to learn when people understand concepts .
I remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works .
First he gave me the example how a water system works .
Also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system .
At that time I was able to learn how is the heart 's work .

Finally undertanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity .
Most of the people who has discoverd new inventions have understood the concept and the idea how things work .
For example , people had to undesrtand the concept how the wheel worked in order to invent the cars .
After that their creativity increased and the final product was the car .

In conclusion , student who know in deep concepts and ideas are able to perform easier in any field because their motivation , learning and creativity will make them to apply his knowlege in any task in life .
