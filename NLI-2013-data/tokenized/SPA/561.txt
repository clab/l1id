The statement agreeing with having a broad knowledge and not a subject-specified knowledge is to one extent wrong .
Having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects might be a positive thing but in the end there is the need of some kind of specialization in order to achieve and get some results .

During the years of formation ( middle and high school ) a range of subjects is needed in order to give the student a chance to get a better idea on where they want to specify later on in their lives .
But once school is over some kind of specialization needs to be required .
Children and teenagers are required to learn no many subjects not because it is better to have a broader knowledge but because they are not old enough to choose which specialized subject they want to pursue .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is the same as having shallow knowledge on something .
With this shallow knowledge no results can be achieved and the result , in the end , is someone that knows a little about everything and nothing about something specific .

Engineers , doctors , lawyers are all specialized in their on subject .
This professions that are the most respected ones are based on specific knowledge and not on broad knowledge .
There is no time or real need for a doctor to know about law and how the judicial system works as long as he knows about his own profession and how to apply medicine .

There is something called General Culture that everyone should learn and use in every day basis but it should not be the only knowledge a person has .
The general culture should be accompanied by some kind of specified knowledge on something that would lead to something .
People that only have general culture do not have enough knowledge to pursue a carreer that would lead somewhere in the future .

The Nobel prizes , for example , are subject-specified and there is no General Culture Nobel Prize .
The physicist that earns the Physics Nobel Prize has specified knowledge that accompanied with research and work in this subject led him to a discovery .

In the end , what is needed in the world of today is a general sense of what is going in the world ( i.e. General Culture ) with some specified knowledge in a subject that might lead to an achievement that would help the world in general .
Having only specified knowledge is also a negative thing because there is a dettachment of the real world that could harm a person and disconect him from the world .
