Nowadays the sciense is advancing very quickly because of the progress of many academic subjects , each day we know more and more about our world , about us ( human ) , the scienses is growing so fast , many people thinks that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other that its better to specialize in one specific subject , i think that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , my point of view is support for the following reasons :
Firtsly , i think one must knows about other academic subjects too , because of that knowledge can will use on the future , since are many academic subjects that are growing and we must to use that advancement , nowadays there are many people how have not only one profession and maybe have a betters works since they know many academic subjects and can work better , maybe can work even instead of other people , and do their works more efficient .

Secondly , in our days many professions have many academic subjects in them contexts , many academic subjects are binding each other for example the medicine is a complex of many academic subjects likes physycs , biology , anatomy , chemistry , mechanical instruments , all of these academic subjects are bindings each other and its imposible to separate them , and i think thanks of that binding of academic subjects the medicine is growing very fast in our days , and i believe all of the professions have not just one academic subjects but many .

Finally , because just thanks of the union of many academic subjects all of the scienses are growing and increasing their knowledgements very fast .
In conclusion i believe that its imposible study one profession or work in that if the person just should to know one academic subjects because noone academic subjects can not survive alone .
