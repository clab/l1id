As a senior in high school is sitting in a roon , he is trying to figure out what he wants to become in the future .
How does a person decide ?
School has given students the opportunity to learn many academic subjects .
Whether it is Math , or Chemistry the broad knowledge that it is atteined serves as a help to discover the inner talents and creativity that a person might posess .

During senior year , one of the hardest decisions is to pick the major or career one wants to do in college .
Would it have help is a student only study one specific subject ?
Is that really the students truly interest ?
I am senior in high school .
At first all I though I like was math , and all I wanted to do was math .
However , the school required some other regular classes and electives .
My junior year in high school , I decided to take computer programming and I felt in love with it .
Then this year I currently have physics and it is like my favorite class in the world .
When it came down to make a decision of what I wanted to do with my life , I took all the different classes I took into consideration .
Since , I had such a broad knowledge of many subjects like math , physics , and computer , I narrow it down to electrical and computer engineering .
I am very glad that the school provides such a verity of classes .

However , this does n't only apply to education if not to everyday life as well .
A person may know how to count and mix chemicals together , but can he or she write a letter ?
Life does n't rely on one subject , if not on many .
It would be very useful to have a least a little bit of knowledge on different types of subjects .
With this on mind a person does n't always need to rely on others for help .
A chemist can write correct reports .
A writer can keep organize his finances .
In the end , to go through life it is better to have a broad mind .

In conclusion , the study of many subjects gives the choice to experiment different activities , and helps to discover ones interests in life and goals .
It is useful on making decisions and surviving life .
A broad knowledge is the key to ones inner talents and creations .
