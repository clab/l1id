In general , I would say that both are important and they complement to each other .
In my experience , I would say that it is more advantageous for students to undertand ideas and concepts than to learn facts ; although , this may not be true in all cases .

Firstly , the study of facts is based on the understanding of concepts and ideas .
It is not possible for a student to understand properly a fact if he or she does not have a basic knowledge of the ideas an concepts which constitute the basis of these facts .

Secondly , while the study of facts is based on memory , the study of ideas and concepts allows students to use their reasoning in order to understand the causes and effects of things or facts .
The understanding of concepts allow them to establish relationships between different concepts as well as their causes and effects .

However , it is also important to take into consideration that each educational method has its own advatages or disadvantages according to the student .
For some students it is easier to learn through facts , while other students understand better through concepts and ides .
These differences depend on the type on intelligence of the student .

The study based on the understanding of concepts or facts varies according to each profession .
For example , philosophers learn based on abstract concepts and ideas ; which they identify in facts .
On the contrary ,

I conslusion , I belive that understanding ideas and concepts provide students with more valuable tools and skills for their future lifes .
However , there might be some cases in which it might be more beneficial for a student to learn based on facts .
