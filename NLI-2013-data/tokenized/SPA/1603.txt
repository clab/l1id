I would rather agree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
why ?
Because sometimes some fields are complimentary .
You ca n't study a science field or an economic subject without knowing what is next to it .
Let 's take an exemple : molecular biology .
To be a molecular biologist you have to deal with interactions of molecules within the cell , so you do have to know about the cell .
Also you have to know about physics to be able to interact with the cell without breaking the cell wall or to harm the organites within the cell .
Then also you have to know a bit of chemestry to know at least how the molecules you are working with might interact with some others particles .
And molecular biology might work along with medical fields too , specially cancerology and treating genetics diseases .

Also , I think that in everyday life you ca n't just talk about one field .
To me having a conversation implies that you have knowledge about someting more than the area you work in .
It means also an exchange of opinons , and if you keep on saying the same stuff to everyone , you would soon be out of speech .
You would bore people .
And also who might talk to you ?
Your work collegues might not want to discuss of work after work .
Nor would your friends if you keep on saying the same things .

Nevertheless knowing about several fields does not mean you kave to know everything about each field .
You just cannot , you will keep being a specialist in your own field but having a knowledge about other domains , not necesserely related to yours , for exemple you can know italian and work as an acountant .
So you would be given better job opportunities , and probably allowed to go to Italy .

You have to exceed expectations , and k
