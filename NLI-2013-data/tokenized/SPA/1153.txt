I firmly agree with the statement that knowing several subjects and being polyvalent in various fields is much more important that specializing in one topic .
In nowadays society , things change so fast that the minute you start a career or a specialization , the minute the facts and figures of the subject have changed .
This essence of broad knowledge is what makes people succeed in the world .
Unless you are 100 % sure that you vocationally want to specialize in a subject , the risk of not finding a suitable job because of the deviation of job offering is too high .
Both in terms of time and money .
For instance , imagine that you decided to study telecommunications sometime around the Internet boom .
After you completed the 5 years of hard work , you get out to society with high hopes and great expectations and suddenly you realize that the world has no need for Telecommunication professionals anymore because the market crashed down !
Then you would most probably regret not to have chosen a more general Engineering diploma such as an Electronical Engineering degree .

Take the example of a devoted music student that really loves to play music to the point that he drops classes so he can go and play his music .
Perhaps , he will become a succesful singer or solo player , but the chances that he fails are there and when that really comes true , he will not be able to attend university classes because he did n't passed highschool .

Good and innovative ideas often are the result of composing other ideas .
If on one side , you know how pollution of carbon dioxide is chemically produced and on the other , you are an expert on plant species , perhaps you can find a way to create a system to purify the air in the world .
And moreover , if you have skills of marchandising and marketing , you can probably be in the Forbes ' next month main page .

Think that you can always specialize in the future .
Going from the trunck of a tree to the tip of a branch is easy , but getting from one tip to another tip is , literally , as going back in time .
