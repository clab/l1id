I strongly agree with this statement because when I look up to a successful person as an example I find someone that try something new , develop new abilities that maybe he or she did not know they have and as a consecuence make them move forward .
I know a carpenter that was making 7 dollars per hour , but today is a millionar , why ?
Somebody gave him an opportunity to work in a big project ' They offerered to him to built the roofs of a series of buildings , even though he never did that kind of job , he did not reject it .
He got trained in that area of construction and the people were so happy when the work was finished that gave him more work .
In a couple of years he became no an empleoyee but the owner of his own constrution company .
