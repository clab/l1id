I think that the advertisement is what really push you to buy something that you need , or think you may need .
Because of the way the product is showed .
Some advertisements show just the product advantages , but does not show the disadventages , so the client or the posible clients ( you ) are convince that is what you need , without serch for others products that offert the same porpuse but in differrents ways .
Some times we buy before do any research in differents products of the same kind .

The price is something that really makes the difference , because if bysides the advertisement shows just the adventages and it has a really low price in compare with other products of the same kind , that really influens your desitions , because you always want to save some money , at least if you are a normal status person .

The advertisements are good to show you the differents kinds of products you can find in the market for a certain porpuse , always if they tell you the trurth .
Some companies just made their advertisements incompleated , as I said before they show you just the good part of the product , and sometimes they overfull you of their advertisements , so you will make your desition based on what you seen more often , You get to tell youself `` if you see it every where it most be good , so I will buy it '' .

That is what push us to make mistakes , we can not leave our desition on the companie 's hands , we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offering is what really is , and what I really need , otherwise you do not need to buy it .

So my adventage is that always make sure the product you are buying it what you think it is , you can check with friends of yours that had bougth it , or with different stores that sale it , do not let the advertisement convince you .
