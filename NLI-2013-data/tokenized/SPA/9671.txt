From my point of view , human life is so complex that the only way to learn valuable aspects is by trying events that we had never tried before .
For instance , an engineer may be a genius in developing complicated mobile phone services , but these services may not appeal to most of the people .
So what he or she should do is concentrate on completely different subjects such as people 's needs and habits .
Probably , he or she has never studied anything related to this , but the only way to obtain success is by trying .

Let 's see another example .
If we worked for Microsoft and we would simply expect to earn money for the current version of Windows , Other company may create a powerfull operating system that would gradually substitute Windows .
That 's why we would have to invest an enormous amount of money on a new operating system .
If we do n't do it well the company will eventually disappear but if we do n't do anything it 's much more likely to disappear .
Nowadays there is much more competitiveness than what it used to be .

Obviously , these measures are always taken after many hours of debate and requiere the support of many workers .
But the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate , then other people will innovate for us and they will be successful but not us .
