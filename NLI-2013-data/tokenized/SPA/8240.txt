I agree with this statement , because the ultimate goal of education is to promote knowledge of a subject .
Knowledge of a subject only comes from the full understanding of the ideas and concepts related to the topic .
It is as important to know the main set of facts as it is to understand the ideas and concepts around those facts .

In my experience being able to understand the ideas and concepts have often times help me to arrive to the same set of facts , proving that I have acquiered the knowledge necessary , but also the tools to conduct individual research and investigation .

While it is true that there are exact sciences ( ie , chemistry , physics , or math ) which depent on specific unchangable facts , it is important that students of those subjects are able to deconstruct the formulas , paradigms , and algorythms that have produce such facts .
This creates a deeper understanding of facts and when the researcher is faced with a problem it is easier to solve it in a succesfull manner .

Education should not concentrate on merely facts , specially in sciences where new discoveries are happening everyday , which change the way we understand our universe .
In the case of social sciences , such as history or anthropology , where facts are the building blocks to understand later developments it is important to realize that those facts are normally told from the winning party in the conflict or the prevailing species in an environment .
In these cases the understanding of ideas and concepts will help the student investigate how different events may have changed the final outcome .

Full understanding of ideas and concepts would lead to more complete and complex research , which will help to understand our world better and not remain in a status quo where facts are unchanged and become dogmatic with time .
