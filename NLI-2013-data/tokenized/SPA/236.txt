Definitely to travel with a group led by a tour guide is not one of the best options that can be taken .
This is based on a bad experiences that i have had with this type of travels .

The disadvantages that the people has if they choose the groups travels are :
- Schedule needs to be followed , what this means that if you are in a great city like chicago and in the first day of the visit you found that what you most enjoy is the michigan lake , and on the second day on chicago you will want to repeat the visit to the lake you definitetly can not do it , due the fact that the tour bus has a schedule and a route that needs to be followed and the second day vist on chicago are the museums .

- Other disadvantage is that sometimes when you travel with a guide it is kind of tired due that the whole day you are walking .
- Next point is sometimes you do not like the way the guide does the speach or the explanations of the visited locations .
- It is very important most of the times to know the group that you are travel with .
This is beacause sometimes there are picky persons that are too loud and it is something that you can not be dealing with , specially if the tour duration is like about a month .

After all the disadvantaged menioned above , it is very important for people to do some research before booking a group tour led by a tour guides , where you can find people that will be taking the tour , the guide that will be given explanations , the schedules due that most of the times are very thight and boring that do not even worth it .

Summarizing the best way to travel is either alone or with a group of people that you already know .
This gives you a lot of advantages to really spend the time during your visit on activities that you will enjoy .
