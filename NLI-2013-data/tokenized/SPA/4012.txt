I fully agree with the following statement : ' young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping theor communites . '
It is hard to fing a youth who enjoys and is willing to help other people .
I , as a teenager , admit that helping others is not my priority .

One of the main reasons why i believe young people do not spend much time helping other is the lack of free time .
As an student of the International Baccalaurite ( IB ) program I spend a great amount of time studying and preparing for the exams in May .
According to the school , we should do atleast 3 hours of homework every night .
I come back from school at four thirty , then go to the gym for around one hour and then do my homework .
By the time I finish it , it is already 8 or 9 o'clock .
This does n't leave me much time to do activities to help my community .
Furthermore , the little time I have free I want to spend it on things I enjoy doing the most such as meeting my friends .

Another reason why I think youths do not give much time to helping their communities is because of the increasing competition in the world .
Out parents want the best for us i.e they want us to be successful .
This desire of wanting to be better than our peers has made us more selfish and therefore reduce our willingness of helping others .
For example , for a professional sportsman to become the best one in world , he needs to practice a lot .
These training setions take time ; therefore he will have less time to help the community .
In addition , psychologically , he will only be focusing on him getting better and dismissing other things such us helping the others .

Competition also leads to another reason for my opinion ; the lack of even getting involved in programs for helping the community .
Because some of us are sometimes brought up in way that everything involves around competition we do n't even try to help others ; we do n't know what it is about .
The IB requires the students to complete 150 hours of what is known as CAS ( Creativity , Action and Service . )
This part of the programme encouraged me to get involved in acitivities such as collecting clothes and food for refugees , helping teacher plan activities and organise family days .
I have to admit that I really enjoyed them and the feeling of satisfaction after helping other is amazing .
So , because of the lack of experience , I assumed that helping others would be borring and not worth ; however , I realized it was the opposite .

In conclusion , I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do n't want to or sometimes is n't even their fault .
Programs such as the IB has noticed this weakness in the current teenager and is trying to recover their interest in helping others .
I think that parents and teacher should also emphazise the importance of these and the benefit we get for doing it .
