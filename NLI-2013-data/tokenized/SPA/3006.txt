I disagree with the statement that `` young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do '' because having a fulfilling life does not depend of age as people can have the same activities or responsabilities .

Although many people would believe that age is a factor for happiness , this is a false statement because older people can enjoy life by having the same activities that young people have .
Many adults might not see hapiness as simply partying or having holidays ; however , this does not mean that they are unable to do these activities .
Adults tend to value things that young people do not see as part of their daily hapiness ; such as , having a family .
And , they choose to stay home with their families instead of going out with frinds to the closest pub .
Nevertheless , the activities someone does depend on personal choice and should not be confuse with matter of age .

Other people believe that young people enjoy more life because they have less responsabilities ; however , this is not completely true .
With globalization , young people are facing more challenges everyday .
They not only have to obtain the best grades they can get at school to secure a future job , but also they have to become self-relient at an early stage to help paying for their education .
On the other hand , adults are seeing everyday people better prepare in the workforce , and they have to return to the classrooms to obtain more knowledge which is a responsability that many people associate with youn .
In this way , adults do not necesarily have more moral or monetary responsabilities than young people that avoids them to enjoy life .

In conclusion , for people to enjoy life should not be seen as a matter of age because anyone can choose to have not only the same activities , but also the same responsabilities .
Heppiness depends on free will which all humans posses .
