I completely agree with these statement .
When a new product , whether is a service or an item , is launched , almost all the times , the marketing people has to find a way to enhace its qualities in order to convince the final user to buy it .
Researchers says this is almost psichological based in the client expectations about the product , for example , if the product will make the user feel or look better , or if the product will give its user some kind of social position , specially talking of a trademark such as Louis Vuitton , Rolex , etc. , so the marketing crew reflects those product or service attributes that will make the final consumer feel he is adquiring a great thing .
But this does not mean the product will be able to reach all the client expectatives .
There are some times , when the client buys something , guied by a great advertisement , which enhanced to the top all the qualities of the product , and , maybe , others qualities that actually are not part of it , giving a great deception to the consumer when he use it .
This also makes a disadvantage in advertisings which shows products much better than they actually are , because if a consumer is disappointed with its buy , chances are that he will tell to at least ten persons that the product he buyed , atractted by a false advertisement is not as good as they offered , thus , these other ten persons will also chat to other people the feeling of the first disappointed consumer , making them consider other options in the same range of products to buy instead of the one advertised .
There even have been some legal action against the `` lier manufacturers '' .

Trying to avoid some of these cases , manufacturers are actually putting some `` little labels '' on their products , to explain to the consumer that some of the product qualities has been enhaced in order to show them better .
For example , in cereal boxes , almost always shows the little phrase , `` enlarged to show texture '' , but not to make the consumer that the product size is actually like the photo on the box .

To conclude , I think it is better to show the real qualities of a product , just as they are , or at least , to make any statements of the reasons they enhanced their product , just as the example I made of the cereal box .
