The education process has evolved during recent decades .
In the past decades , students were tought in a way that would only permitted them to memorize facts .
The importance of education relied on accepting facts rather than understanding them .
Things have changed , and nowadays students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning only facts .
The world demands well prepared people capable of analyzing situations , solving problems and proposing ideas .

When students understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts they are able to develop a process of constant and connected learning .
They are able to apply ideas and concepts at different fields and they can find relations within different subjects .
They have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life .
This makes the knowledge process smooth at all levels of education .
Students are encouraged to understan rather than simply accepting ideas .

The problem with learning only facts is that it partializes the knowledge .
A student would only memorize facts for a certain subject and it would not be able to find its aplicability in other fields .
Facts only respond to specific details and eventough they are useful , they can not constitute the pure basis for education .
Facts do n't permit discussion .

As an example of what I have presented before we can analyze a history class .
It is different to learn history learning only dates and facts that took place at a certain time , than to undestand ideas and concepts that lay behind the facts .
If a student is able to see the connection between events and to undestand the conditions that gave birth to a certain fact they would undestand many of the things that take place today .

As a conclusion I would say that the education process needs facts as well as undestanding ideas and concepts but the last one , is more important for developing a well constructed and supported knowledge .
In my opinion , the early you give a student the possiblity to do this , the better he/she wil performed in academic life .
