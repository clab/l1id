I agree or desagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , depending on the size of the group .

I desagree if the group is so big .
I had the opportunity to travel with a big group to a country that nobody knew before .
It was a very bad experience because the tour guide was in trouble because he was responsible for everybody and during the traveling some got lost .
Some wanted to spend more time looking at other things and some wanted to take pictures and got lost , etc .
So , i do n't recommend traveling with big groups .

Instead , i agree that the best way to travel is in a small group led by a tour guide if it is considered the following :

First , the group has not to have more than ten people .
In this way , the group can be well managed according to the cirscunstances .
For example , you can easily rent a van to visit some other places that are not in the itinerary or you can plan a party during the nights .

Second , the people that are traveling together need to have almost the same age in order to have fun .
It is not easy when you are traveling with old people that you can hurt with a simple noise or with anything that they do n't like .

And third , do n't let the tour guide to take all the control over the itinerary because they can be like a father carrying little children .
I have been seeing tour guides that do n't give any flexibility to the groups .
Being in other countries and other cultures the group wants to experiment the new environment , especially at night if they want to have a party , and not having someone to tell yor `` time to go to bed '' .
