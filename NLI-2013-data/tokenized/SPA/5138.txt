I agree wit the presented statement .
The express purpose of advertisement is to induce a change in consumer behavior towards favoring the product presented .
Most advertisement arises from the need to create Product Differentiation - a process by which products that are in essence the same ( for example , two hamburgers , both are made of bread , meat , cheese , etc ... )
are presented to consumers as different ( Wendy 's , McDonald 's , Burger King , etc ... ) .

Product Differentiation is necessary in markets rueld by monopolistic competiton : several but not infinate suppliers , demand is not the only determinant of price .
In order to charge a higher price , a given supplier has to modify his product in the eyes of a customer : in comes advertisement .
Soda manufacturers have developed many brands ( Coke vs. Pepsi ) , small modifications on existing brands ( Coke with Cherry , etc ... )
and have to keep advertising to create the impression on customers that a branded product is different from , say , Walgreens-brand cola , and pharmaceutical companies have to convince customers that Advil is superior to generic ibuprophen .
By its very essence , product differentiation has to make a product appear better than the competition , desite the fact that they are the same .

Beyond product differentiatiob , advertisement is used to introduce new products .
New products have to overcome consumer 's initial guarding against the unknown using techniques such as celebritiy sponsors , or displaying other costumers satisfied with the product ( or wearing the product with a smile ) .
The implied message is , you will be like a celebrity or you will have the same smile or be as satisified as the portrayed individual .
This in essence makes the product seem better than it really is : there is no way a given product by itself can guarantee my satisfaction , as I have to provide a response , determined by my own notion of satisfaction .
Part of the purpose of advertisment is to modify this notion .

Advertisement is also prone to `` reporter bias '' , that is , only good or positive results and characteristics are advertised and negative or unfavorable results are of course hidden .
If the battery life is poor , no mention is made of battery life .
For well known health hazards , warnings have been introduced to the advertisement , which is an admission of the fact that the product is being portrayed as beneficial ( Marlboro can attract women , according to commercials , but of course can lead to cancer ) .

Now , a product can be advertised in a way that is more honest an up-front with the cusatomer .
Usually , this only happens when this is required by law ( for example , drugs ) .
However , the very nature of advertisement leads to down-playing the importance of these apparent flaws .
In all drugs commercials , mention of side effects comes well at the end of the commercial , are of course spoken over a powerful image of a satisfiedsenior playing with his grandchildren , and spoken quickly and in a soft tone of voice .
The underlying message : yes , drowsiness , but who cares when you can play with your grandkids ?
