From every travel , what we get at the end are just a group of memories .
Events , things learned , people met , and lots of specific information that may be with us until we leave this world .
A tour guide is an effective and excellent way to ensure a quality trip , and what better than a great trip with friends and family !

My family is a huge fan of tour guides and is obsessed with traveling always together .
`` We all go , or nobody goes '' my mom usually says when somebody is planning a trip on his own .
They always say that the trip is not even worthwhile without the two key ingredients : a good group and a good guide .
I sometimes wonder myself if they would rather leave me and take a guide to all of the trips we have made in our lifetime .
I have to say , regardless of the weird obsession my parents have for guides , I agree with them .
Having a guide helps you understand the history and the people of the place you are visiting .
You can get recommendations for good places to eat , fun parks to visit , and interesting museums and shows .
And best of all , share all this with the company you have !

On a trip I made to Europe two years ago ( obviously with every member of my family ) , I went to see a city that hundreds of years ago had been covered in lava , and completely destroyed .
The first thing my father did when we arrived at thhis amazing place , was to look for the best guide he could find .
I think regular parents first take a look at the place , read something about them , and probably go buy the tickets to enter ; but not my dad .
In less than five minutes he came with a spanish guide that had studied history in a prestigious university , and spoke around six languages .

Although I make fun of my parents ' obsession , I have to say that in every trip we make we have the best tour guides a tourist can possibly get .
I should probably thank them for getting the best out of every place we visit , because that is really priceless .

In conclusion , I would like to say that groups and guides are an incredible combination for every trip .
It gives you people to talk and have fun with , and the touch of history and education we should all receive .
