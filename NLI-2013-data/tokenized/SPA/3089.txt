Do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do ?
I do not think that would be the complete answer .
At present , not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones .

Nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies , such as electronics , giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones , internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young .
But this also , is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth .

Most of the time , these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression .
Young people is still learning to live , but in a world totally different of the older man .
Today there is more competition for all , even for finding a job , now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world .
This causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience .

Sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations , and sometimes they take this in the wrong way .
The necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs , acts against them .

The older people now take advantages of the advances in medicine than can increase their life quality , and in some cases , to cure the illness known to commonly affect them .
They , in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation .

I think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people .
We have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young ones are barely trying to go throw .
