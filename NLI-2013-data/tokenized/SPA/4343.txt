It is complex to clasify young people .
Some are really concious and helpful while other are just selfish members of society , consuming the money of their parents and wasting time .

Community service is now a very well recognised activity , specially by universities .
That 's why so many students get involved in helping others , to get points for their CV .
From my point of view people who do that are really mean and unfair .
It is really beatiful to say that everyone loves helping the poor and the disabled , but actually not everyone likes to spend their free time in treating this type of people .

I do like going some weekends to the nearest home to help mentally insane people .
My school organizes this actitivity , and I 've seen so many people who only went there to get points for the community service program .
It is really deceiving to see this young people , sometimes your friends , standing there doinmg nothing and basically not helping , but disturbing your work .

But apart from helping in homes and special centers , communitiy service also involves keeping clean your street , the parks you visit in your free time and helping in your particular home .
With this I mean not throwing garbage everywhere ( just because you think someone is going to pick it for you ) , helping your mum to make dinner or wash the dishes after it , and so many other simple activities .
Young people do n't seem to be very interested in this activities either .
They think their only obligations are to get home , do their homework and study ( even though many students do n't even follow this directions ) .

In conclusion , generally young people , specially teenagers , do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Going further , the ones who actually give , are expecting somekind of benefit .
Only a few youngsters follow the pattern of `` good member of society '' , and sadly those ones are considered the freak , instead of being encouraged .
Surely better education could change this common selfish attitude ; even though you cannot make a silk purse out of a sours ear , and some people wont change in all their lifes .
