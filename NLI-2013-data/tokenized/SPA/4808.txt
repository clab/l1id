The publicity sells , and if you want that someone buy your product you will make a lot of things possibles so your products can be brought .
If your product is good or bad no one will know it until he or she prove it .

I agree with the statement because there is always a product that isnt good enough to the publicity it has and had been made for it .
But there is always a person that buy a lot of things or products even if she or he doesnt know exactly what it is or what it contain .

However if your product isnt good there will be someone that always buy it because it has something that the other product doesnt have .
An example , a man of thirty years doesnt know what to do because he have less hair everyday , he wake up and he have hair on the pillow then he wash his hair with all the care possibly but the hair is only going down more and more every day he prove all the products but neither function and then there is your product waiting for someone to buy it and it has a lot of publicity .
He has view it on t.v so he think why not im going to buy it so he buy it and the next week he have three more hairs and he is happy and he is now a new man .

However he doesnt realize that it has second reactions and his heart pulsations had been increasind the last three months that he had been using , but remember that he is a new man now because he have hair and its true he have a lot of hair now .
Now that he is a new man he start to run and he went out of his house and run and run but then he start to feel a pain a big pain in the arm so he stop and start to breath a lot but his breathing has been more difficult so he start breathing softly and softly and softly and is calm now .

So he walk to his house and went to the hospital and they said that he will suffer a heart attack and they dont know what is the cause and then he is thinking what it can be so he talk to the doctor and tell him that he is using a new product that allows him to have hair and the doctor saw him and said - you know what , you arent the first that came here for that .

There are a lot of products that seem to be much better than they really are but with that kind of plubicity we cant denied to buy it so we buy it and we tried it but we have to beware about what it is and what it has made of so we cant have that type of problem .
