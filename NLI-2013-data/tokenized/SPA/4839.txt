When you buy a product yo do it for many reasons , maybe because it is neccesary for you , maybe because you like it or maybe because someone or something says to you that such product is excellent But , is it really true ?
Well , I think that this can happen with advertisements .
It is fantastic how persuasive advertisements can be .
They show the best of the product but obviusly , they do n't describe , if there are , the bad part of them .
But like all in this world it will depend on each situation .

On one hand for example , there are really good products that can fill all your expectatives and they are just what you are looking for .
So , with products like these , I wait that advertisements tell me all the propierties of the product and that they give me the true reasons to buy it .

But on the other hand , you can feel very dissapointed if you aqcuire a product that is not the same as you believe .
And this could be worst when you do that because in the advertisement the product really seem much better .
Nevertheless , you can reclaim to change the product but this could not always be possible .
In my case for example , I had bought hundreds of thinks in order to put on slime , but I realiced now that the only think that works is less food and more exercise .

If I have to sum up I will give you an advice : do n't believe so much on advertisements .
Not always they reflect the true about a product .
You have to be sure yourself before aqcuire somethik .
