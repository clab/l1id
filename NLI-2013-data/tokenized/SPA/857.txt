In my point of view , it is allways good to have knowledge of many academic subjects .
When you are based only in one specific subject you will never be ready to do any other project that comes up .
You will only be ready for things you know .
Many examples exist on the world of today , people only study what they want to do in life .
So all they are based on is on that material , But what happens when their future doesnt turn to be what they had planed ?

College is the opportunity to choose what you really want to be in the future .
You must know that what you study is what you are going to have to spend the rest of your life doing .
Sometimes things dont go the way you plan .
It is why we should have knowledge in all academics subjects .

Beeing specialized in one subject has its advantege and disadvantege .
beeing specialized on what you think you are going to be good at , its sometimes a risk .
We are not sure of what is waiting for us out there .
For example : if i choose to study law , and im good at it but everything i know is law .
So in my future i dont get a good job , but company offers me a better job but not as a lawyer as a business man. i cant take it because im not good at it .

The advantege of beeing specialized in one subject is that if im really good at it i have 90 % of beeing the best a t it .
That will bring you opportunities to have the best job and be well paid .
For example when you study medicine .
If you are only based on those subjects and graduate with honors .
You know for sure you are going to be the best doctor because of you knowledge .

It it allways good to know many academic subjects but at the same time to be based on what you like to do .
That way you are sure that no matter what happens with what you are based on , you will allways have different choices for the future .
