The car is one of the most important machines the man have created .
Human life have changed a lot since this machine , that at first was exclusive but that now is consider as one of the most necesaries , was invented .

The car has become one of the most important ways of moving around .
It is used for every type of trips : long trips , where its use is less common , or short ones , that we ca not imagine doing without sitting at the wheal .
New generations had become more dependents on cars than old ones .

Nowadays the cities are not biuld for walking .
The distances from one place to another are so big that noone can go walking from here to there without getting exahusted .
The new type of city makes the need for cars greater : the jobs are usually allocated on the city , but the houses are placed on the suburbus .
For example in the states they are areas for everything , nothing is mixed .
With this what I mean is that the houses are all together , then you have the moll area , then you have the area where the office are placed etcetera .

Some people will say that public transport could make or need for cars lighter , but the truth is that it does not work .
People drive cars because they have concrete needs that they need to fullfil .
For example there is never the same bus that takes you to the grocery store , the school where your kids study and your own house .
It is simplily easy to drive your car wherever you need to .

This are some of the reasons of why I belive that in twenty years ther will be more cars in use than there are today , beacause as the time goes by the need becomes greater .
