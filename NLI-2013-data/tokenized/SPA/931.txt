For my it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learn more .
The diferentes materials : Arts , Science , Mathemathics , Literature , Politic , World , Economy , Languagues , Cook , Technology , History .
Learn to the watherver topic , or subject , realize a person .
Most learn most prepared to great job in anything work .
Wao !
Need talk about all topics with all people and help in different material .
And specialize in one specific subject realize people `` genious '' on the specialization .
Special people , learn about science for example and specialize in this maerial have big concement in the cotidians jobs .
In my opinion learn the all academics subjects realize the people or much very intellectual people .
Maybe readding more books , less television , more educational programs .
Whn travel at other country , learn the other cultures , your idioms , custums , religion .
The world is totally different and more learnd of the other materials more prepared for any situation .
Noy bad for specializa in specifict subject no , no .
no .
But always y need learn , I nead have a knowledge for evrethyng topic .
I like I enjoy knowledge .
This my live .
I am play instrument and learn evreday at the other materials .
It 's so funny learn , funny and intersting .
