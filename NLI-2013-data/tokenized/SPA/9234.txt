When we are at school most of the knowledge we absorve is from ideas and concepts , things that we commonly learn from our books , that are taught in classes but can not be understood from ourselves because we 've never experienced .
That 's why sometimes ideas and concepts can be considered unrealistic , because they only work with and ideal background or enviorment .
On the other hand facts are real , facts are things that use to happen and the difference with ideas is that sometimes the aplication them can not be easily put on practice .
For example , at schools , we all learn about theories and formulas that were invented to use to resolve problems , and that 's what we do at schools , we make a simulation of some problems that can be resolved with those tools .
But the the thing is that not everything in our life can be resolved by a formula , we wish it could happen that way as easy as it sounds but it 's not .
The truth is that people sometimes learn from their mistakes from personal or professional experiences and those are examples of facts .
The real knowledge you get , you learn it within the past of the time and that makes you wiser than other people .
You get the respect from other people by what you know , and some of these things , are things you get by the experience or facts .
I do n't think that ideas or concepts are unnecessarys for the students , this is also an important issue , but this es only the start .
The learning experienced by ideas and concepts can not be very clear for the students because its something they have not lived with their own skin .
Once students have the ability to get recognizing all these a put it in practice as a fact , they have a clear image of what this is talking about .
Finally I would n't take the credit of any of both choices , because certainly concepts and facts go together , but for me I think that facts are what we are maid of , is what we see , what we touch or what had happened to us that make us stronger people , and make us take right decitions of a personal or profesional situation .
