I disagree with the statement that is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
When you travel with groups and guides there are only predetermined places you can go to , and also spend a precise amount of time in each activity .
These are the main reasons why I prefer to travel on my own .

I think that if you travel by yourself , you are not subject to a specific schedule , also you can organize yourself in a more convenient way .
Sometimes you feel like staying in the hotel and rest or do something totally different than the rest of the group .
Also it can happen that you do not get a great and cheerful group of people and that can contribute to some tension among travelers .

Several years ago , I went to Brazil in a tour with several friends , and ofcourse , we thought that having a tour guide would be the best thing to do .
Initially was o.k. , but at the end became a nightmare because we wanted to do other things that were not part of the guided tour routine .
For example , we wanted to go to Buzios , a small town with amazing beaches and a lot of natural sites to visit .
Unfortunately , and because the tour guide refused to take us there , we were not able to visit Buzios .

Some nights we also felt like going to different and more exiting places or stay longer at others , but , we were reminded of the policies in place .
Guided tours are very restrictive , and because of this and other experiences I have had in the past , I believe that traveling on your own is the best move .
