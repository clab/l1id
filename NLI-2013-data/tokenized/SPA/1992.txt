That young people enjoy life more than older people is relative of each person .
For me a 25 student trying to achieve many things as a good job or high steem reputation the life some times could be stressfull , but it is important to keep a balance between what i want and what i need .

Some times the older people have enough benefits to enjoy the rest of their lifes .
Of course they worked for all their lifes , and right now have the money to spend travelling or living in quiet places where they can rest in peace , but what about those with out the benefits ; In contrast there are old people around the word without money or benefits of any kind .
They sometimes have to go to the streets asking for cents so they can live .
In this case it would be impossible to get a good quality of life .

On the other hand , the young people have all the chances in front of them .
they can live their lifes as they want , sometime rushing in new things without thinking the consecuences .
Others young people are more concerns about build a reputation and have good jobs and that kind of life make them happy .
I think that all depends of what the people want for themself .

To conlcude , for me is easier to enjoy the life and get the things that i want working as a young person , thus i can start to work in how I want to spend my life as and eldery person , so i could enjoy it when that time comes to .
