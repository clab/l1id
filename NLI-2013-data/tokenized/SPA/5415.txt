To me , the whole point of advertising is to sell , thus when advertising you should try to seduce the costumer .
In fact there are many things or features of the product that you can use to do so , as the quality or the price , but always the main thing of show the good features over the bad ones .

I agree with the idea that advertisements make products look better than they really are , but I do n't see anything bad with it .
Indeed , our freadom of speech ensures us mainly the right to say almost everything to everybody , with some exeptions of course , but under this perspective anyone could told us anything , in particular how good is the product they are offering .

Most of the times , the advertisements do not lie or say anything strictly false , instead they focus on their strenghts .
Therefore is true that the products looks better than they really are , but is not ill will on that .
Indeed , it is the same thing you do when you go to a job interview , or try to approach some of the opposite sex for first time .
Think about it , in these ocations you try to look good , seem confident , very capable , intelligent or even sexy , realice that you are trying to look better than you are .

Although I consider that some exagerations should be avoided , becaouse they are not showing how good the product realy is , instead thay are a lie .
For intance , see the all magical recipies , belts and all kind of crafts and offered to lose weight , everybody knows that is a lie .
I think ths kind of things should be controlled by some costumer 's agency , which should request some kind of survey or stadistics to support things that are stated on the advertising .

Anyway , is in the costumer and the costumer 's agencies who will at the end decide which product deserved an which does not , our trust .
This is the only way of realy punnish tose that make reallly exagerated advertiments saying lies or said unproven things about their products .
But always whitout attaking the fredom of speach or see things in a particular prespective .
