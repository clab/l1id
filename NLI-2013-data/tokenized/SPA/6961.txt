I disagree , I do not think that in twenty years there will de fewer cars in use than there are today .
People who think differently probably feel protecting the enviroment merits strict regulation restricting car use .
Nonetheless , such regulations have proven , in many instances , to accomplish the contrary regulatory goal .
For example , in places such as Bogota , Colombia , longstanding restrictions on car use have helped to improve the traffic situation during rush hours .
Nevertheless , such restrictions have been ineffective as regards the overall number of cars in use .
The restriction implemented in Bogota , and other Colombian cities , allocates the right to use a vehicle during rush hour on certain days , depending on the last number of the license plate .
For example , license plates that end with the number `` 2 '' may be used on mondays , wednesdays , and fridays , an not on tuesdays and thursdays .
Such a meassure has greatly increased the demand for automobiles , since peolpe are not willing to use the preecarious transport system in place in the city , and prefer to buy a second car in order to avoid the restriction .

Considering the exponentiality of birth rates , and the importance of car manufacturers as job generators , I think it is safe to assume that more and more people will become car buyers , and automotive industry employees .
I also think that researching better fuel alternatives , and better , enviromental friendly materials and car construction techniques may lessen the impact the industry has on the enviroment .
In sum , I do not think the number of cars will decrease in twenty years time for four reasons .
First , Restrictive regulation is not always the best alternative , and sometimes even makes the situation worse .
Secondly , there is no reason to beleive that that overall demand will decrease , given the fact that population increases , and ecomonies such as China , which are waking up will surely fuel the market for more than 20 years .
Thirdly , the industry generates a lot of jobs , it is very important , and lastly new technologies may lesser
