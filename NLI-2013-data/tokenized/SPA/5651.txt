Most advertisements make products seems more efficent than they really are .
Nowaday the marketing improvements , in order to sell more products , does not care about the needs of the costumers and what they are looking for .
The big business usually find solutions to their economic selling problems only by taking care of their wealth , and not by taking care of what the costumers need and if the product they are selling has a good advertisements of its qualities , and say the true about the content .

The advertisements of a product introduce us to what are we going to buy , so is an important part of the marketing in the business , becouse by looking at the advertisements of a product , the costumer will decide if is good for him and if is what he is really looking for .

Nowaday with the new improvements in the industry , make long quantities of a product is easier than in the past , and also is easier to transport them to the stores , so they are more accesible for the costumers .
With this improvements , the big business are starting not to take care of the product qualities , and this qualities have to be shown in the advertisemnts of the products .
So the business try to make the product seem better than it really is .

For this marketing function , incentivate the buy of a product is the first objective .
There are many ways to reach this objective .
One of those is to make the external part of a product seem cool or really good , so with that , the costumer can not try the product or see the real characteristics of it , and he will decide if he buy it by looking at the advertisements .

Finally I think that that economy plays an important role in this cheat , becouse money make people do anything they could to be wealthy .
