This statement is something that has always been said .
In the past , for example my grandfather has told me , that they tought that in the year 2000 everything was going to change , machines were going to be able to controll everything , even us , cars were going to be able to fly ...
but more or less every thing continue being the same , somethings have changed but some others have not .

In my point of view this statement is not true .
Everybody now wants to have a car and investigators are looking for some new ideas to build the car of the future , a car which probably consume less petrol than one normal car does nowadays .

Everybody will try to have the best car and the one with the most sofisticated dessign , as now having the best one and the most powerful one and if it is possible not only to have one car even try to have two or three cars , is the same to be an important person every body will try to be the most important person with the most impressive car or cars .

It is possible that pollution might be reduce as cars have to pass more controls each day and that pollution is becoming a more important problem every day , so that engineers are searching new ways to not pollute as much as cars do now .

In addition , as cities are becoming bigger and bigger every day people will need their own cars to go for example in a big city from the north part to the south part , a distance that in the past could be covered by some minutes walking .

In conclusion , all these reasons state why my opinion is that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than there are now .
