The issue of whether young people nowadays contribute enough time to helping their communities is a controversial one .
While the observation of the behavior of a few individuals might indicate so , I believe that the opposite is true

Firstly , as a native of a underdevelopped country , I was able to observe poverty and felt the need to do something about it .
Both college and university , I joined a group of students that regularly went to local shanty towns and helped in different ways .
Something I especially recall from that experience was the fact that whenever I shared this interest with other friends , they also expressed their interest and were , in many cases , willing and able to contribute and help .
The same happened to me a few times with adults , but in general this was not the case .
I acknowledge the fact that the world of adults has usually stricter time schedules that make these sort of participation more difficult .
Nevertheless , I believe that eventually one helps other because has an inner desire to do so , and no time constraints are valid excuse .

Secondly , I would like to correct the perception of young people as selfish individuals , only concerned with their own welfare .
I also came across many young acquantainces who were not willing to spend part of their time helping others , but is n't this attitude widespread among adults ?
I believe so .
Indeed , I believe there are two main reasons why people do not help : lack of interest or the belief that participation is useless in the sense that it will not solve the `` real problems '' .
While many youngs are not interested in helping others , I had the impression that the belief that helping people is useless is not as widespread among youngsters as it is among adults .
As a result , young people are more willing to participate whenever they face the opportunity .
In this sense , young people are more generous to their communities than their adults counterparts .

In conclusion , I believe that many young people are willing to help their communities .
The observation of a few who do n't should not led us to believe this common misconception .
