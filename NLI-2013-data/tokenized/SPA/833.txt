Knowlegde it 's a basic concept in our lives ; since we are judged by our lever of knowledge .
There are many opinions on what we should have as a north .
I think tha we should specialize in one specific subject .

I am a political science student .
Plato or Aristotle would say that a person must have a specfict field of specialization because no one could be an expert on two or more subjects .
At least , that was what a learn on my classic political thought theory class .

I think that if you have a broad knowledge of many academis subjetcs you are not going to be good , or excellent at any of those .
A person cannot be capable of being an expert on different topics or field .
If he or she wants to be good at something he or she must choose a specific field .

I support my opinion because a person might have specifics concerns so he/shecan conduct specific researches on specific topics .
A person might never have a lot of concerns on different topics because it will be too abstract on everything .
A concentration on different topics will get the researchers confunsed on what they should follow .

A professionalt must folow just a direction .
He or she must specialized in her or his field in order to be excellent on that field .
That is my phylosophy .
