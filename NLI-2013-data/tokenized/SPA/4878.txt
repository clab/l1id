I agree , most advestisements make seem their products and offers better than what they really are just because they dont show the other side .
Many promotions of products advertise their products the way they wish they were but actually are n't because they havent found a way to create the product that way or just because its cheaper the way it is .
But , since one personally knows the truth , one doesnt care about the quality and just sells whatever will earn them profits .
Its incredible to look at this and see the way people have turned to be ; from being so honest and hellpfull in the past to being blinded by money and material interests .
It 's clear that people today day 's will do anything just to appear to others likeone has achieved all wanted goals and have reached fame and power .

A false advestisement can be seen like a quarter , promotion of one face of the quarter , you may be fully convinced that its great and that its all true but when you get close and see all the caracteristics you get to know that there are two sides of the quarter .
Its strange how so many products have been sold in great amounts when one can see the false advertising clearly , so clearly that you ask youself `` how come people buy this ? ''
.
Disgracefully we 're not all brains and people today days get distracted easily , we give the attention mostly to the things that dont matter because we dont do the reaserch needed to compromise yourself with the important things in life and the ones with good quality .

Although some company 's have no '' head '' , no true leader for when there are trouble and demands for products , one can see that there allways has to be a '' head '' in a plan .
Company 's do research , investigations and interviews to find out ways to attract customers , to find out what people are looking for .
This way you pay attention to the good things and not to the bad ; this is a good strategy but in a negative way since it fools buyers .
By puttings attractive colors , pretty designs and catchy names they have all the attention they need from the customers and what they could say `` in our hands '' .
Unconsiously they fool us , they put so much artificial things that they cover the product completely ; it could be just like advertising a completely different product , a total fake and false one .
