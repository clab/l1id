The statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' contains a lot of aspects which can be analysed .

First of all , i do not agree fully with the statement given .
These are some predictions of what may happen in the future with our everyday transport :

In twenty years ' time technology will have advanced importantly .
Nowadays , the population in becoming aware of the Earth 's environmental problems .
A great amount of the society recycles , and does not waste energy .
Many scientists are investigating new ways to save energy .
And cars and transports in general are one of the most polluting producers .
Is there a non polluting substitute for them ?

Today , many investigators are looking for an alternative to cars that will not destroy the Earth .
There are already some cars that work with petrol substitutes , but they are not very popular .
If we found a way to preserve the environment without not using our cars , there would not be fewer cars in the future , but safetier for the planet .

Some examples of non polluting transports are becoming popular in many parts of the world , like bycicles .
Many people , mostly persons who live alone or without children , take their bycicles to go to work or the city .
But this alternative cannot be accepted by everybody as there not everyone lives alone or in the city .

In my opinion , the only way the number of cars will decrease in the future is with new technological inventions .
Maybe in twenty years time we will all travel around by private planes , or by flying skates ...
Who knows ?
It all depends on our future inventors and their imagination to create an easier and less polluting way to travel .
