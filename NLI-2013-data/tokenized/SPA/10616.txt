I am agree , becasue when sucessful people take risks to do something else , they discover that they are able to do new things , and they can help another people with their problems or with their proyects .
If I know that I am sucessful in typing wihtout seeing , it does n't mean that I am going to be only concentrated in this matter because that will not help me to take a risk and try to do something differente .
That means I would never know that I am able to do new things very well .
One example is when I was younger , I wanted to be a teacher , but a I was afraid , because I did not know what grade level I will be teaching , becasue when I was a college student , I used to practice second grade , and it was the grade level that I liked , but I thougth about it , if I wo n't take the risk , I wo n't find out how well I will be as a teacher in a high grade level .
So I took the risk and I got a fourth grade level and I had a wounderful class .
All my students were promoted to the next grade level , which means they were succesful at the end of the school year .
That showed me , that if I would n't take the risk I would'n know I could be a good teacher in a high grade level .
I mean , higher than second grade .
So I recommened to the people to take the risk and try new things rather to be there stock in one thing forever .
The new things that you can do well , will help you to be succesful in differents fields , and that will help you to have a better way to live and enjoy your job or jobs .
