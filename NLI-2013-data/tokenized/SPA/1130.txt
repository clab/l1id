Working and being able to specialize in today 's world is a very big challenge .
There are many different opcions and also a lot of people working in the same field , in my opinion is important to decide in which way should we face our carreer , and the advantages of having broad knowledge af many academic subjects and also the advantages of focussing in a secific subject .

Having Knowledge of many academic subjects is a hard work , and if I decide to do this , I would like to know deeply the things I 'm studying , not just a simple look , and this could be very difficult and hard .
I really admire people who do this and are really good at it .
In my profession , I am a Doctor , this is a big challenge , and there are few doctors who really know a lot about everything and are really good at their job .
We have to consider that this could take many years of your life , because is not an easy thing to accomplish all that knoeledge .
I think that the biggest advantage of this opcion is the dedication , and all you get to know throug the years , but is not an easy opcion and It does not always get the recognition it deserves .

Being an scpecialist in one specific subject , in my opinion , is easier , eventhough there are subjects that need a lot of dedication , time and a big effort too .
I think is better to work in a more reduce field , to be good at a very specific thing , in something that other people is not focussed , so you will get the chance to work more and in my case , have more pacients .
This is a big advantage , and you can study and work hard in this specific subject , learn everything about it , thing that is very difficult when you focuss in too many subjects .

Studyng is always a good thing , and when you do things you like is even better .
I really enjoyed studying medice and now I enjoy working at the hospital with people .
In my particular case , I think is better for me to be specialized in one specific subject in medicine , and I will work hard to be really good about it , I want to do a lot of research about this subject , so I 'm able to know all I can about it .
