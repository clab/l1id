Yes , I am agree with this statement because if the students understand clearly and know the idea and the concept of something , they can expect what to wait and how to act in any situation .
Is better be prepared than learn on the way and receive punished por that .
So is very important that the students be prepare all they can , study and learn all the tools the human being needs on their live .
The education is very important because this help the person to resolve the daily problems and get a better live .
I think a person dont have knowledge is a person dont have nothing to talk and to say the to the other people .
An educated person is better because this knowledge help you to your entire life and not to be an ignorant .
Yes ignorant is the better word to describe a not educated person because if you dont know about nothing how you can share with others your opinion about something , about any topic .
So if you understand the ideas and concepts , you are not a ignorant person and you the talk with anyone about any topic and you can defend your point or statement of something .
Then you go to the facts , that is like an example of the idea or concepts you are observing .
Actually , this fact help you to undestarnd more cleary your ideas and concepts but , if you don know and understand what is the concept you could never see , how the fact works , why the fact is , so you maintain as a ignorant all your life because you see something but dont know what is it .
In summery I agree this satatement about that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because the intelligent and brillant people have a trick , their trick is , the knowledge and the education .
If you are a educated people you are a person with a lot of experience and knowlegde to share in your life .
That is very good .
