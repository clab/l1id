Yes , I agree with this statement .
Many companies make advertisements that make products seem much better than than they really are .
The companies make anything in order to sell their product eventhough they know that they are selling something that is not true .
Many costumers believe everything they see and buy the product if they see that the information that the company is giving them about the products makes it seem good .
Because of the people that buy things when they see them in the advertisements companies think that it is a smart way to sell and will continue using it until someone puts a stop to it .
An example from everyday life is when you want your parents to give you permition to do something you know is not right , in this case you tell your mom all thegood things about it and leave out all the bad things that it has and could have .
Everyday , people say the things that favor them in order to obtain what they want or in order to sell they product .
The big companies that have taken out the smaller companies of the cities convince people really easily of their product just by placing their products as if it where better that the others and the people will go directly to the larger companies that lie about the quality of their product .
When a company tells you that it is guranteed for life they have though really well what are the possibilities that it has for a person to claim that gurantee .
When a company gurantees a product for life , it is a way to persuade people into buying it because it makes it look like it is the best product of all and they are so sure of it that they gurantee it for life so you will buy it .
The advertisements are a way to sell your product quicker and easier .
Every company knows what they can put in their advertisements in order to make them seem better than they really are without the possibility of being later blamed by the costumers that the products are n't really how they told them .
Every advertisement has little letters written below in order to justify what they write in big letters .
