I am desagree with the young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
The young people like a best world and they work in these way , if they can .
Sometimes that look different because the young people at the same time like to enjoy and a few times or a few people looks only they think yourself .
The young people need see the future , not only the present because they live with the problem of the society and they try to help .
I think the youn people try to need more and more responsability and decide about the future and said what are their opinion .

Another reason because I think the young people helping their communities it 's because they work , married , enjoy and these is easy if they do n't have problems .
Definitly the young people try to help with the society problems , because they know , they have the same problems in the future and try found the best solution .
