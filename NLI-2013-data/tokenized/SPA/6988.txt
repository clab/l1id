I not agree with the statement that says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today because of some reasonable reasons .

The main and most important reason I have to defend my opinion is that in twenty years the popullation would growth a lot , and not only in Africa where the birth-index is enormous also in Europe and in all America , and this is going to occur because of the inmigration , it could be legal or illegal , but all the countries are going to suffer the inmigration and migration proccess , instead of the laws and other inpediments governments will try .

The second reason why I feel there are not going to be fewer car in use in the future is that in twenty years scientists are not going to be able to find a new and innovate transport method , like flying cars or what else some people think we are going to have in few years .

Yeah , it 's true that some scientists have made a flying car but in the case they can comercialized it , it is going to be so expensive for the mid-people , so they are going to use the traditional cars .

The last reason I am going to talk about is not as important and relevant as the two others , it is the comodity .
Nowadays the comodity is a very important factor of our society , all the innovations in technology or in other subjects are to make more comfortable our life .
Moreover , we create things not to thinking more about what to create , those things we have create are going to do that job instead of us .

To sum up I have to say that I feel it is ridiculous to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
