Young people in these days have enough energy to do anything they want to , anytime they want it .
First of all because they are healthy and strong so they have no physical limitations .
Furthermore due to the fact that they have not yet experienced a lot in this world makes them hungry to taste every area of life .
Moreover their only role in society is to study and prepare for their future that is the reason why they have no economical , social or family worries yet .
In addition , it is imposed to them that they are `` at the top of their lives '' so it is their chance to do everything they want .
These are the reasons why it is commonly believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However I do not really think young people of these modern days actually enjoy life , the majority is not mature enough so they run through life experiencing things that they should not experience at young ages and tasting everything as if the world would be destroyed in a few hours .

The fact that older people do not have the energy or health required to party all the time , eat anything they want , run cars , or whatever young people do nowadays , does not mean their life is over and they do not enjoy life anymore .
In fact , I think they have a greater opportunity to enjoy it .
My grandma and my mother are excellent examples of this .
Even though they are not able to do a lot of things anymore due to their age , both are happy women enjoying every minute of parenthood and frienships .
`` There comes a time when you realize relationships are the most important things in your life , more important than objects such as cars , beautiful houses , jewlery , and so on '' , says my grandmother to me all the time .
Furthermore they are so thankful for the wisdom they have acquired through all these years of experiences , that for this reason they enjoy their lives even more every day , as if it where their last one .

To sum up , I do not think enjoying life has anything to do with your age , but it has everything to do with your heart .
