I would like to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However as far as I am concerned , this is very unlikely to happen .

The only solid argument that I can find to defend the reduction in the number of cars is that due to the lack of gas and consequently the increase in its cost , people will buy less cars .
Nevertheless , people are so used to have a car that in my opinion it is more probable that we will move to electric cars .
Furthermore , what would happen with the big car manufacturers ?
I think that they would find ways to keep people buying cars .

Another fact that we have to take into account , is the growth of cities .
Things are further and further nowadays and there are few policies trying to increase the use of public transportation .
Therefore the use of car becomes very important .

It is also relevant to measure what cars imply .
They are an evidence of economic power and they provide independence , a feeling of freedom .
Are people going to renounce to those feelings ?
Honestly , I do not think that teenagers are going to reject their only source of independence .
The same way people in their fifties will keep buying sports cars .
Those are traditions that have become too relevant in our society to be changed in only twenty years .

What about the new powerful countries like China ?
As the salaries increase people tends to consume more .
China is a new market willing to buy more and more cars as its citizens can afford them .

For all the reasons sated above such as , the power of big manufacturers , the new demand in countries like China , and the role that cars currently play in our society , I do no think that things will change in twenty years .
