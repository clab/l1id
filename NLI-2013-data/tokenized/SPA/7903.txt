well according to the question if i am agree or disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
i 'm disagree because i think that the best wqay to travel is along or whit jus one person is preferet to be a friend why because when you travel to some where you want to experiment that you can explore a wold for your self you can go for every where and you can meet a lot persons which can guide you can develope a montain .
for example when i went to guadalajara i just come whit a cousin and nether of both know anything about that city when we were in the bus station in the first we feel panic because were too people in there , but after a minuts of conmotion we star to asked of the people about which way to take for go to the hotel what kind of bus left us in the center where is the glorieta o the catedral , when we arrived to the hotel the people know that we did n't know anything about the city and the be so kind and warm they explained us what please we could visit , which bus to took what kind of food are typically in that city so we meet to guadalajara for the people to live in there wherever we walk we asked to a boy or girl we found in ours way some of them lauging of us because they tough that we are crazy because we took a dangerous travel because we did n't know the city but ai can said that thise experience was the best of my life i share my experiency whit some of my friend and they said you are crazy .
but i just said was great !!
