When we talk about traveling a lot of things comes to our mind like prices , places to visit , time to expend in such place and if is good to be led by a tour guide or not .
I think the best way to travel is by oneself , without a tour guide .
There are many reasons that support my idea .
For example oneself could visit other places not offered in the tour , design their own schedule , and skip non interesting places .

In a tour the guide take their group of tourists to an especific place , already planned by the travel agency .
In contrast , without a tour guide oneself could go wherever he/she want .
For instance , I traveled to Toronto and I found interesting travel to places by myself .
I had the chance to talk to people from the city and ask them the best places to visit from their point of view , they know better than tour guides .

In a planned tour , the tourist have an schedule to follow .
I prefer to plan my own schedule , according to my interest and necesities .
For example , what if I want to go and relax all day on the beach .
If I have the chance to elaborate my schedule .
I can adjust my plans to visit other places in order to get what I want .

Finally , some tour agencies have tour plans to visit places that are important to certain type of people .
I went to visit Florida for my vacations and I had bad luck because I traveled with a group of old people .
They were not interested in visit places like Busch Gardens or exiting theme parks like Universal Studios .
They just wanted to stay at the beach , or go to quiet places .
If I would traveled by myself without a tour guide , I would visited theme parks with those exiting roller coaster , or visited beaches full of young women .

In general , I consider a better option to travel without a tour guide .
The experience is more exiting and suit to oneself interest .
Therefore , oneself could visit places interesting for the person instead of places interesting for the tour agency , create their own schedule and skip `` boring '' places to other more interesting .
