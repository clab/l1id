In this essay I am going to explain if i agree or disagree that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First at all I think that nowadays there are really a lot of cars , that are making really dirty and unhealthy the world .
This is due to the low prices of the cars and the increasing salarys and needs of the society .
Our world just care about material things and we are forgetting that in a few years maybe we will not be able to walk in the street becasue the sun will be really unhealty for our skin .

So I think that is really difficult that the number of cars decrease in twenty years , except that the state starts to work today in this problem .
I think we are really selfish because we are not thinking in our future generation .
So I think that the best think to do now is start to work in this .

The actions that i would do to decrease the number of cars would be the following ones .
First of all I would increase the public transportation , but i would also improve the conditions of the buses and i would decrease the prices of the public tranportation .
Secondly I would increase the taxes of cars due that they dirty really a lot the citys and they also damage the envairoment .

To conclude , I think that if the state starts to work hard to try to decrease the number of cars will be possible in twenty years that there will be fewer cars than there are today , but i think that is really difficult to reach this objective , becasue until now really a little of people care of our nature , and if we want to decrease the number of cars we will have to work really hard with the help ot the state .
