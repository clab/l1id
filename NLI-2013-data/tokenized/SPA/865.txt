Life is full of diversity , not only of individuals , but also of experiences , subjects and situtations .
At the same time , it is also full of uncertainty , nothing is secure or granted ; which means that no one knows what is going to happen in the future or what obstacles a person may encounter in his or her life .
People always have goals which are frequently based on their interests and beliefs .
However , much people tend to concentrate only in their interests and never acquire knowledge about other things in life .

For me it is very important to have broad knowledge , to know something about everything in life , especially of academic subjects .
Education is the basis of opportunities and the amount of subjects in which a person has knowledge conditions his or her opportunities in very important aspects of life like work and even helping others .
For example , if a person studies only subjects concerned with science and he or she needs to work and there is no work available in a science area , but he or she knows something about business then there is another possibility for work .
At the same time if someone needs help in something about history or even if there is a competition about historical facts you can be able to participate or help the person even if you are a chef or a doctor .

I think it is important to be prepare for everything in life and to acquire the broad knowledge that will help you confront any challenge especially in education or work , which are basic for survival .
Lamentably as the old saying satets `` life is a box of chocolates and you never know what ysomethings happen unexpectely and if you are not prepare to afront them you are not going to be able to move on .
