I believe that concepts and facts are pretty related each other , so both of them are necessary during the student 's learning process .
In many cases , concepts are the result or the inferences made on studies over facts , like for example pyshics law of gravitation that could be inferred after years of observations on planet movements , or demand and offerts law , that summarizes the behaviors of the buyers and factorys seeing for many years .
So , to get a full comprenhension of a concept , it is neccessary to review and study the facts that are involve with the concept , and then try to undestand or infered what the concept is summarizing patters or similar behaviors that you found .
Many professor and students just like to take a bounch of facts and review it , but this kind of learning approach is meanless , because you use facts only as supportative information , so you can really get a full understanding of what the facts are showing or what are happening .
For others is more likely the approach of trying just to understand de concept without reviewing or analysing the facts , making very difficult to get a full understand of the concept and even making very difficult to applied it in real situations .
For my the perfect convination of learning from the facts and undertanding the concept , is the best path to a succeful learning process .
