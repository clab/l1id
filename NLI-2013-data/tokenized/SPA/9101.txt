The statement of what is more important for students either to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts is controversial .
However , in my experience is more important to understund ideas and concepts than just simple facts .

First , I belive that by focusing entirely in facts you are missing the opportunity to understund concepts and ideas surrounding facts .
It is important for students to have a good understanding of the situation going beyond facts so this way they can extrapolate these learnings to different situations .

Second , as a professional chemical engineer myself I have always never seen that a situation is the same twice in my career .
It can be similar but not the same , the only way to tackle new situations is by being clear and understand the ideas and concepts of the situation .
As a result of my background and training as an engineer it is almost strange to solve problems based only in the specific facts you have learned in your career .
You need to again go back to the basics and focus on concepts and ideas to be succesful not just facts .

Also , by having a special focus on ideas and concepts you can help develop the creativity of students .
It is important to encourage students to understand not just ideas and concepts but from there to develop their thought process and creativity .
By focusing only in facts , it can be challenging to develop other areas like creativity if the only things students are facing are facts for particulat situations .
Moreover , by looking at the big picture you are also helping students to understand how in many situations facts can be different but the ideas and concepts are the same .

Last but not least , it is important to keep in perspective that we live in a constantly changing world and by making for students more important to understund ideas and concepts they will be better prepared to be succesful in the future which will bring to them newer and more challinging problems than what we have experienced in the past .
