I do not think that it is always the case that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
For example teenagers live at that age a very traumatic period of their lives and normally they hate themselves , hate others , hate their lives , hate everything !
so I definitely do not thing that they enjoy life more than others do .

Young people take risks , I think that is the difference , they want to explore , know , achieve things and sometimes they take their lives for granted .
Yes , sometimes it is true that young people know how to have more fun unlike some older individuals but it does not mean that it is always like that .

Older people have experience , know more about some things , about how life is and I think that the more you know , the more you have experienced life , the more you value things , you stop taking things for granted and give them the right value , you appreciate more because it has taken a lot of effort in order for you to have what you have .
They can enjoy life more simply because they have more memories , either happy or sad but they have them , memories that enrich their everyday life , they have more people to love , more stories to tell , they have lived more .
How would you enjoy life at the most if you have not lived enough ?
If you do not really know how life is ?

Of course there are cases in which older people are bitter , angry at life because they have suffered a lot but that does not mean that more experienced people cannot enjoy their lives as much or even more than unexperienced persons .
It all depends on the way of life you have , how grateful you are , how much love you have given and received , what you have learned in life , etc .
It is definitely not a matter of age , it is more likely , I think , a matter of personality and the circumstances that surround or have surrounded your life .
