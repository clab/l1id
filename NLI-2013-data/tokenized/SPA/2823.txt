I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people tend to be innocent and naive to their surrounding world , and thus can enjoy life without worrying about the future .
Older people know how the world works ; they have bigger reponsabilities than can affect the world more , thus they have to keep worrying about the consequences of their actions and cannot enjoy life at its full potentail .

Young people , including children and teenagers , are being introduced to their world .
The learning process is like a enjoyable journey about the meaning of life .
Their innocence prevents them from thinking beyond the future and thus they enjoy life without thinking about the consequences of their actions .
They tend to be more liberal when making desicions ; they want to try everything that is ahead in their lives .
This form of thinking allows them to enjoy life with liberty .
An example that best illustrates the liberty of young generations is the free expression of love on the 70's embodied by the ` Hippies ' .

Older people tend to think differently than young people .
They think more about the future and and emotional stability .
They are experienced and know the dangers and benefits of their surrounding environment .
They tend to be more conservative when making decisions and always have to speculate about the outcomes of their choices in life .
Thus they more reluctant to try all the different tastes that life can bring , because they can judge the future consequences of their actions .

In conclusion , I agree that young people can enjoy life more than old people ; because young people are naive and can wonder through life without thinking about the consequences of their actions , while older people have bigger responsabilities that prevents them from acting freely .
