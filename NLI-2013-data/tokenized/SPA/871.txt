Knowledge is power .
Knowing a little of everything is better that knowing a lot of one thing in specific .
When you have a lot of information in your brain you will be able to have great conversations with other people .
You will be able to fell more comfotable taking and being more social .
Cause you feel secure that no matter what , you will know what to say .
Knowledge opens a lot of doors , will not keep you in a small circle .

I do n't want to be misunderstoud .
Specialize in a topic or subject is not bad but this ca n't be the only thing you know .
Cause knowing a little bit of everything will assure you that you will survive in most of the situations that you get in life .
I love theatre and want to specialize in that .
But being good in theatre does n't make me good on making food or organised with me money , you know .
There are things in life that you have to know so you can survive .

Is like the persons that thing that the only language they have to know is the language they speak in their country .
That 's wrong cause if you want to go to another country for vacations and they does n't speak your language , It will be very hard for you to communicate with people .
And one of the funnest thing of going on vacation is to interact with the people of that country you are visiting .

I thing people should be excellent in one thing and very good in others .
It should not be empty spaces in your brain .
Society should focus more on promote knowledge cause almost everybody know that humans does n't use they brain in they full capacity .
And having a society with people that are good in a lot of areas , is a society that you know will have success .
That no matter the adversity , they will have the tools to confront and search solution to there problems .
That others society that does n't have people with a lot of knowledge .
Knowledge is the key to solve problems , to see the future with more confident and the key to not make the same mistake that in the past .
A knowledge of many academic subjects will enrich the person , will make a person more attractive and more happy .
