In my honymoon my wife and I traveled by car to all Italy we were able to stop in any place that we like ore we can move if we don n't like the place or if we were tired .
I remember thast in Florence the chappel was close because the goberment was repairing it so we have the oportunity to take the car and leave the city , also in the pissa we saw the pissa tower , that was amassing , and then leave to the next city nevertheless we saw a group leaded by a tour guid that had to waith until the time schedule for that city was finished to move on .

Whoever travelling with a group led by a tour guide did n't offer this benefits , in my opinion it gives tow benefits , the first one is the explanation that the tour guide gives , and the second one the rates that you have for travelling in a group .
In some countries there are not tour guides that can splain you the history of the place , some specific ditails about the constructions , the way of leaving , recomendations in the food , and also recomendations in the prices , all of this can be very helpfull when you travel by your sellf .
AlsoIt is amassing the rates that you can find in the market if you travel in a group , the persons that organise this kind of trips are always finding the best rate because they sell volume so the hotels give them the best rates to fill the hotel , also they arenge transportation and is cheaper travelling in a bus that in several cars .

For my family and I the best way of travelling is without a tour guide and by our self , because we prefere to spend mony renting a car in a foreing contry and have the oportunity to decide wheter we wanth to stay in a place or not , also if you travel to lage cities you will find electronic tour guides that can easilly fastforware .
