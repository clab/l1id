I agree with the statement for several reasons .

Many centuries ago , the total amount of scientific knowledge was not very big .
One usually think of a man of the 16 century , say Galileo , as a complete man only if he or she master all the aspect of science .
Nowadays , every specific discipline has grown to an extend that it is impossible to master it all .
For example , lets concentrate on Physics .
There are lots of very specific sub-fields , like Barion Particle Physics or Maser Optics .
It is impossible to know everything about all the specific sub-fields , even if we concentrate only in Physics .
Since it is not possible to master an entire discipline like Physics , I think the best option is to try to know a little bit about everything .

Second , people specialized in a specific subject can find very hard to interact with other scientists .
Every discipline has its own mathematical tools , its own vocabulary and its own way of thinking .
Therefore it is really difficult to get a good interaction between a Biologist and a Geologist .
A person who can handle many academic subjects can interact with a lot of people .

Third , a scientist who has a broad knowledge can always get advise from a expert in a specific field when needed .
It will be much harder for an expert to get an aplication of his knowledge in other fields because of the lack of knowledge of the potential applications .
For example , it could be really hard for a Matematiscian to get an application of some probability theory to sociology .
On the other hand , a sociologist that knows a little of mathematics , could ask an expert all the questions he or she has .

In conclusion , I think it is a better strategy to try to manage several disciplines .
One can always get advise from an expert if needed .
Also it will be easier to interact for a person who knows about several academic subjects .
