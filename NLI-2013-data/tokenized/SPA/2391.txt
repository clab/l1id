Although it might seems that younger people enjoy life more than older people do , one need to be careful before making such assumption .

Young people certainly for the most part seem to be more extroverted about the ways they pursue experiencing , and having fun .
Perhaps this is the reason why the market is loaded with a plethora of outlets for them to consume and experience `` joy '' or better said `` fun '' .
Nowdays as technology advances there seems to be a never ending industry aimed to providing entertainement for young folks .
This explosion of gadgets and toys certainly can be distracting to the not-so analytical eye and might lead to believe what the statement says .

However , I consider that older people enjoy life as much , if not more than young people because they have reached the maturity for doing so in a more simpler ways ; and because they might have mastered the basic elements that conceive the art of enjoyment at its purest essence .
Certainly the joys of older people tend for the most part to manifest differently from those of the younger crowd .
And therfore being unperceptible to the young and inexperienced eye .
One of the reasons is simply because older people did experience similar `` joys '' when they were young and do not need them anymore .
The other reason is because they might make `` less noise '' about the ways they enjoy life .

Some may say that when older folks were young they did not have all the technological toys that are present today in the market and therefore they could not enjoy life as young people do today .
Certainly , Play Stations , DVD , and MP3 were not around 20 years ago , however , technology such as radio , television , record players , and more that are taken for granted today , were inovative technological `` toys '' thirty and fifty years ago that provided plenty opportunities for the youth of that time to enjoy life .

Certainly , it is much easier to travel today than it was fifty years before , but then most people did not think of it as a way of enjoying life .

One can even go further and try to think about non-western societies where electronic gadgets are not part of everyday life .
There too , young people tend to enjoy life differently than older folks .
Young men might go hunting and young girls might be involved in weaving while elders do n't do these activities anymore .
Perhaps there the difference might be that more often than in our societies , both young and old people gather together to enjoy for instance story telling sessions , where the elders are the main providers of fun and the youngers ones become apprentices of the ways they will enjoy life later on .
