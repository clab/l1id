I am agree about most advertising try to shows as the benefical and useful that it is , in some case the product is not useful but with a good advertising can changes the produc and tranfor these in a necesary product .

Now the advitising has the power to show to the customer whatever that the public want , Know the most important is sell product , this is the priority , in some case you can see products and special in televison that you can said , What is that ? , Is it useful ?
somebody will be buy that ! , that is the advertising magic , this example coming to my mind , a Cola drink for example , everybody enjoy of a cold cola drink , this kind of cola companies had the best advertising in the market , its product 's the best , but with the same product can will be used like detergent , because the cola is so strong than can clean washrooms , and then can be use like open a nut when is really hard to open .
The advertisements only looking try to sell their product without import their product show that really are .

Anothe example about this topic is organic food , the organic food is more benefical than the normal food , I guess , the companies made the same kind of food , but only the difference is the packet , for example in the natural organic food the price is almost the double than the regular natural food , but thaks to the advertising the same bananas has different taste , if you try a organic banana will be have the same taste than the regular banana .

In conclusion , the advertisement only put their product more better only to influence in the price of the product or when the product does n't have the enough especification
