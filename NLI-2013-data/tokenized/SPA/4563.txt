Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In our twentieth century world , money is one of the biggest issues for most people .
When companies create a product , they want to get to as many people as they can , so they use advertisements on television , magazines , and even the internet in orther to announce their product .
Since companies compete with each other to sell the most products , they have to show people how their products is the best .
Therefore , they use techniques that glorify their products so customers are persuated to buy them .

One technique companies use are subliminal messages .
In the commercials , the companies advertise their product close to something that makes people feel good , such as a nice beach , or a good looking female .
When a person looks at the advertisement , he/she sees the product as better than it actually is , and is therefore persuated into buying the product .
For example , Victoria Secret , the famous underwear brand for females , uses good looking women in their commercials to make other women think that this product will look as good on them .
Companies also over-advertise , so their product gets stuck on people 's minds and when the time comes to make a decision in what to buy , the customer remembers the adverisement and buys the product .

Advertisements can also make products more appealing than they are by adding special effects .
This technique is used specially on food products ; for example , Chili 's , the restaurant , does commercials on burgers and their food , where they put special paint and shiny effects , so that their food is seen as perfect .
They sometimes even use fake artifacts to make their product seem better than it really is .

In conclusion , companies want to advertise their products to the public in the best way possible to they associate their products with things that are not part of the product .
They mislead customers into buying something that is ultimately worse than what the company advertised .
