I clearly disagree with the statement .
Fistr of all because the car is an essential method of transportation .
People use the car for everything ; for working , going shoppping , travelling , etc .
It is true that the cities are getting saturated of cars and the public transport is the best way for moving inside the cities , but people are also moving out to suburban areas where the public transport does n't reach .
These families have to use the car for picking the kids at college , going to the mall , or even to buy the bread .
We are turning into a a society that does n't walk , we use the car for everything .
This is mainly because we do n't live in the city where we have all types of services and supplies just down the corner .

Secondly , the car manufacturers are making cheaper cars every time that can meet the economical possibilities of people who colud n't afford a car years ago .
These cars are also cheaper to mantain and more reliable .
I just bought a car last year and the first mantainance check is after twenty tousand miles , when my previous car had to be checked every seven thousand miles .

The only challenging point of view is the duration of the `` petrol era ' .
The humanity is using up all the petrol ; planes , cars , boats , industries ...
they all need petrol to function and the resources are limited .
There will come a day when there will be no more left and the engines will not run any more .
But the car industry has done researches for new sources of energy that are clean and , best of all , unlimited .
This will promote the use of the car , nowadays a little bit pinpointed due to the contaminating effect they produce .
