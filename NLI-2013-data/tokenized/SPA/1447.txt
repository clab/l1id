Things in life are usually not black or white .
It is difficult to say if it 's better to work on having a broad knowledge on many different academic subjects or to put that same amount of effort on specializing on an specific field .
In my opinion it all depends on the short term objectives of the student which is , after all , closely related to the age .

For young age students who are in school , high-school or even in the first years of university , studying a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects will probably be more suitable .
Diversity is basic in these stages for various reasons .
First of all , students need to obtain certain level of general culture , what includes history , geography , maths , literature , grammar , sciences ...
It also needs to be taken into account that some subjects interact with each other .
Someone ca n't study physics with no math knowledge , so a variety of fields need to be covered .
Finally , it is also important for young students to become familiar with a variety of fields so that they can choose what they would like to specialize on in the future : it would n't be sensible to let a ten year old chose if he wants to study only biology f just because he likes that particular subject at that stage , for example .
They need to have a global vision before deciding what the like , and the way of obtaining it is simply studying a broad syllabus .

However when considering adult students , priorities obviously change .
For people in their late university years or in graduate courses specializing in a particular subject is basic .
The most important reason is that companies require specialists to cover job positions .
Companies are not usually interested in people who only know a little bit about lots of subjects .
They look for indivuduals who are proficient and have a deep knowledge and understanding of specific fields and industries .
If the candidate additionally has a broad knoowledge of other things it can then be considered as a plus , but the first characteristic is that he/she is a specialist in a particular subject .

As a conclusion it could be said that the age of the student is the best indicator to determine whether it is more suitable to study a broad selection of subjects or to focus all the effort in an specific field .
