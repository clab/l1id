I study Communications and I have learned that one of the objectives of advertising is to rescue the positive things of a product or service .
So I disagree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' because I think that advertisements do n't make products seen better , they just show the positive things of a product .

For example , if I buy watches , maybe my watches are n't cheap , but they have a guarantee for 10 years .
So I have to communicate - in the advertisement - `` my watches are n't cheap but you are going to save a lot of money because of the 10 years guarantee '' .

What is not permitted is to be dishonest .
In a class named `` Legislation of the communication medias '' I learned that are advertising codes and rules that shoud n't be broken .
In that code is stated that companies ca n't lie about their products .

Once I heard a profesional in advertising saying that `` if you have to use dirty kinds of advertisements is because you are'nt a good advertiser '' .
I completely agree with that .
If you are professional in what you do , you will sure find a good quality of the product to advertise instead of breaking rules and being dishonest .

Its true that advertisements have to persuade , but there are a lot honest and legally ways to make an effective persuation .
Of course there are advertisements that make the products seem much better than they really are , but I do n't think there are the MOST .
There will always be people that brake rules , but you will surprise to see how many people make his best effort with the rules they have .
