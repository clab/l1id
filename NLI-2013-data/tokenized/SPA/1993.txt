I agree with the statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' because young people have a good health .
They also live their lives without difficult responsabilities .
On the other side , older people feel tired to enjoy their lives .
I believe that young people live their lives happily .

Young people have the opportunity to do whatever they want because they have excellent health .
For example , they can run outside when it is cold .
They will not get fiver because they are strong .
Furthermore , they can eat anything what they want .
Consequently , they enjoy their lives because they can visit any country and eat different kind of food .

Young people live without difficult responsabilities .
They do not need to be worried about to work hard in order to earn a great amount of money to pay their billes .
They are happy to earn enough money to buy simple things .
Furthermore , they only think about their personal goals .
For example , to study in good universities with fun people .

On the other side , Old people are tired to enjoy their lives because they have huge problems that they need to resolve every day .
They have problems with their hearts and stomaches .
Consequently , they are not able to receive bad news or eat in any place .
They also have financial problems because they do not earn enough money to enjoy their lives .

In conclusion , I think that young people enjoy their lives than older people because they have good health .
They have good opportunities to do many activities .
However , old people suffer because they have many problems which they need to resolve .
