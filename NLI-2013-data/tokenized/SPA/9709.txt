Many books may have been written about the subject : `` 3 Keys to Success '' , `` 10 Easy steps to to reach the top '' .
There might probably be even a `` Comple Idiot 's Guide to Success '' .
But there is a thought that always comes to my mind regarding to life stories that achieved success .
Those people certainly tried new things and took risks rather than sticking to routine .
I cannot but agree with the premise : innovators and risk-takers are the stuff for success .

Some people argue that once you find out what you are good at , you should stick to it .
These strategy suggests that this conservative , risk avoiding behaviour , assures some kind of success while avoiding any chance to fail .
But even people who enter this routine of doing always the same suffer failure sometimes .
I must agree that I ca n't imagine Einstein suddenly trying to succeed in football .
Yes , he should remain in the science field .
But , on the other hand , his unquenchable desire for knowledge moved him forward in his research .
His quest for the new , made him one of the famoust scientist there will ever be .

On the other side , holding a totally different position , are restless people who are constantly trying new things and risking everything to be singled out off mediocrity .
People who take high risks , are focused on big gains .
For example Columbus undertook a risky trip , but his name remains written in every history book .
The Wrights brothers went after a dream which was deemed impossible in their time .
These are the people from which we can say they are outstanding .

While I do n't think we should go around doing crazy stuff , we should always try to escape routine .
Repeating ourselves too much , is like slow death .
It never ends in success .
