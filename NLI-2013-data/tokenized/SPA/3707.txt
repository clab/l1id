Have you ever been on a bus when suddenly an old woman gets in it and nobody offered their seat ?
I guess that every one who has seen it , at least one time in their lives , will agree with me when I say that nowadays young people does n't care about helping their community .
Rigth now it is not a normal thing to help old people to cross the street , or to offer them your seat in the bus .

When I was at school , I used to go to the local hospital for working like a voluntier .
I really loved !
My dutties were to take care of some kids while the cleaners worked on their rooms .
I spendt four hours a week playing with different kids .
It was n't a hard work for me , and it was a very usefull activitty for my community .
I think everyone should try to help their communities , due to the fact that they will be able to have fun an at the same time make an excellent job to help other people .
Because all of this they may also feel better with themselves

However , what it 's true is that in the 21th century 's young people normally has a lot do .
For example is pretty common for teenagers to work during the year , or to play different sports .
Maybe those are the reasons , but maybe what happen is that young people is becoming very selfish .
If they have time to hang out with their friends I 'm sure they can also find time to help their communities .
Not to much time is requiered .
You can make a lot with a \ only a few hours a week .

In conclusion , nowadays young people do n't give too much time to helping their communities , actually they do nothing for their communities , and this is very sad .
I think schools should have kind of a subject to show kids how to help others and how to be involved in their communities .
