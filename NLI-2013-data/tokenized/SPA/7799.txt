I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In first place i considerate that this is a safer way to travel , specially when you do not know very well the place that you are visiting .
In second place , i think this the better way to know all the historic places and the most important details about an specific city or country .

When you travel to a place for the first time it is almost necessary that a tour guide could aid you with the organisation of a tour that result in the best knowledge of the place you choose to travel .
Moreover when your visit is led by a tour guide you will not waste time visting places that are no highly important , or that will not give you any idea about essential aspects of the history of the city or the country that you are going to visit .

Within second place , travel in group is safer than travel alone .
When you do not know the security conditions of an specific place , you will be able to feel more comfortable if you voyage with persons that are close to you , specially if your family goes with you .
In this aspect a tour guide also could help by telling the best and safest pleces to visit .

As a conclusion it is important to considerate that the most important aspects to travel in a group led by a tour guide are : the facilities to know the place , the security that a group can offer and the good memories you will able to keep
