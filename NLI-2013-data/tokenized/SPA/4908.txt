Advertisments is what makes the product to be saled .
When offering a product the best quality of it is shown .
this marketing technique has boost up a lot of product for not saying most of them .
We have some cases like shampoos , clothes , and medicines .

First , most of the adverstisments company only wants to sell , no matter how , no matter when , but the faster the better , sometimes they exagerate the functions of a product or its qualities , to convince and presuade people to buy it .

Second , the product will eventually work but most of the times not in the way shown in the adverstisment , lets take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo , the advertisment will show a bald man who wants his hair back , so he will use the shampoo for a few days and after minutes in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience , i really do not beleive that , thats my personal opinion because they say you will se results in a short period , and yes , you will see them but not as much as they say it will .

Third , advertisments create sometimes a non-real idea of the products , or if they do they will show you real shallow .

In conclusion , advertisments only work for boosting up a product and convince a costumer .
It is not a main purpose show what the product really is or how is it going to work or how long does it will take .
They just want to convince you and persuade you to buy it .
Thats why i strongly dislike to see advertisments , everything is a big lie , my quote is `` advertisment products do half of what they say and half of what they pomise '' .
