Cars have been vey important since they were important .
At the first time not many people could afford it , but now most of the population owns , unless , one .
However , in the last years we have been told many bad news about the enviroment .
Cars consume petrol and then it burns in order to make the car works .
The result of this activity affects a lot to the atmosphere .
The Ultraviolet rays are entering in our sistem , crossing all the covers of the atmosphere .
The enviroment is very polluted , and as a result of this animals are desapearing .

Anyway , cars help in this situation as well as the human being action .
In the news they recomend us to take the bus in spite of driving everybody their cars .
If that idea works the enviroment would improve .
Besides , animals are n't the only ones that are affected , humans can suffer many injuries , for example problems when they breath or even it can be seriouly affected to the sight .
Moreover , blocks of flats are part of the problem of polltion , many houses look dirty what that 's a consequence of the pollution .

From my point of view I think that if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today that means that people will start to take care of the enviroment .
Not using the car constantly as much as we do now implies less pollution .

Although cars not only affect to atmosphere with the pollution .
There are so many reasons why I agree with the statement .
Cars are very noise and much if they are in a traffic jam and they are in a hurry .
When they start shouting to each other .
That 's not good for the people who is every day hearing this unconfortable noises .
In a long time this can causes many health problems such as stress or even heart problems .

Finally , I wolud n't like to forget saying that the less cars in use are in the streets the more bus drivers will be , that means that there will we less unemployed people .
