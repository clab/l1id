Nowadays exist a lot of people that study an specific profession , and when they finished it they realized they they do n't really like it , so they work in an area that they do n't enjoy .
What is worst people study a profession and after a year or two years they change to other profession , and they can do this many times , so they waist their time trying to find something that they really like and they enjoy .
So I agree with the statement that says that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

If you spend time studing differents subjects , and expanding your knowledge , later you will have more options to decide what you really want to study .
Because you will have study different types of subjects , and you will have more options at the time you choose a profession .
And the college you aply will see that you have studied subjects related to the profession you aplied to .

Another advantage of studing many academic subjects , is that you will have spend time in many different types of subjects , so at the end you will know in what subjects you are really good at .
That way you wo n't enter to a college to study a profession that later you realize that you are not good at , and because of that you will have to change your profession and you will waist your time .

Finally we can say that studing different academic subjects , you will expand your knowledge , you will see some of every subject , you will learn different kind of things , and your knowledge will grow .
So in the future , maybe when you have children , you can teach them what you have learned , eventhough it does n't refer to the profession you studied .
You will always have that knowledge with you .

As a conclusion I can state that I agree with the option that says that is better to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .
It will help you in many things in the future .
You will be a mor versatile person .
