As an undergraduate student I know the importance of understanding ideas and concepts more than facts .
Why ?
Well because I believe that the idea has the important information .
Sometimes it is not necessary to know specific things about a theme , it is more important to understand the central idea , so that the facts can be used as reference .
For example , if a topic is a difficult one , it can be easier for someone to understand the idea first , so that later he or she can analyze the fact , solve problems using the fact , or investigate other facts .

I think that if someone undestands the central idea and if that person is able to explain it to someone else , in a way that he can understand it too , it means that he has already learned the important thing .
I am sure that to explain the idea he will use the fact he analized before , so he has already relationed the fact and the idea .

If the person remembers the facts .
I am not sure , but I believe that most people cannot accept a fact unless they understand why is that .
It is not easy to tell somebody that something is going to happen in a certain way if something else .
As a good example we have kids , they are always asking why is this , or that , and they do not stop asking until they understand the answer , and as they grow up they learn that facts have an explanation .

I know that there are some facts that someone has to know , some basic things people has to understand , like the meaning of a green light , because this is a sign that means the same in the whole world , but facts like this are few , that is why I think that it is more important to understand the idea o concept .
