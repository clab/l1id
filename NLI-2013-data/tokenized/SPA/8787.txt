Through the years sciences as psychology and sociology have studied what it is more important for the human beings to understand ideas , concepts , definition or to learn facts and many of them have got the conclusion that it is more important to understand because it has many advantages for people and for the science than to learn facts .

First of all , the brain works differently when human beings to master comprehending ideas than to master facts .
The human being can store this information for more time what they are able to understand and can remember easily it , too .
For sure when we learn only facts we can see that we forget in a few day or in a few minutes that we learn .
With this point we can show learn with facts is a waste of time .

Second , from the view of learning is better is that people can easily relate all that they learned when they are able to compare , differentiate and optimize between diferences and similarities between concepts learning understanding than when they learn facts .
With facts , people can not relate or well compare two events that they already happened in order to apply them directly in the present time .

Third , for the science this kind of learning brings more oportunities to create something new and be implemented in a competitive world .
This last point is very important because we live in a changed world where everybody tryes to do something new and if we are able to decipher concepts , of course we will be capable to create , invent ideas in benefit of diferent fields like in medicine , computers or in other field .

At the end , I agree completely that it is better to learn understanding ideas , concepts that learn facts in order to improve not only our brain , mind but also be able to create new cures in medicine or an item that benefits in different fields and going around againg , why not in health that it is one of fields that need more solutions than the rest of the sciences .
Understanding how works everything we will do a better world with solutions and we will create a better quality of life for us and for the people oncomming .
