In my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group and with a tour guide , because when you travel wtih more people is more fun and specially if is leading by a tourist guide , he will know the best places to visit .

If you go to visit another country is important to by led by a tourist guide , because usually you will not know anything about this place , or country .
He will know the most popular places and they way to get to them .

If you go to another country , they people from this country maybe speak another lenguaje , in this case is going to be difficult to find the places were yo will like to go specially if you get lost .
There is when the tourist guide will be helpful , he will know the lenguaje of the country making things easier for the group .

Another reason is that tourist guides know a large amount of history , in this way when you are visting museums for example the tourist guide will tell you all the important details of the hystory of the place you are visiting , making the trip more interested .
In addition to that the idea of learnig the history of a country , is more fun with a group of people .

In conclusion a group travel led by a tour guide it will make any trip more enjoyable , because the tourist guide will make the trip with less worries , and the group of people that you travel with , will make any trip a trip to remember .
