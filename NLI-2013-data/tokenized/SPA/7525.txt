There are a lot of ways to travel and a lot of places to visit , with the development of the transportation means , distances have been reduced considerably , and it is much easier to travel all around the world in an easier , cheaper and faster way .
Maybe when traveling to another place you could wonder what is best to travel in a group lead by a tour guide or to travel by your self ?
I think in order to answer this question you have to take into consideration several factors as where you want to go and how much you are willing to spend , among other things .

I think it is really important to choose a destination because there are some places where a guide would be necessary , as a colonial city or a city filled whith history and monuments to visit , but if you are going to a beach or a place just to relax , you may not need a guide to show you the city .

The amount of money you are willing to spend on your jounrey can also determine whether you hire a guide or not , if you are traveling on an austere way , it would be better if you did not hire a guide , but if you had a lot of money to spend and you want to visit every inch of the city it would be a great idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

For what is written above it can be seen thet , there are some things that have to be considered when deciding if traveling on a group with a guide or traveling by yourself , but there are also some other factors , as the saftey of the place you are visiting , as well as the knowledge of the language and the culture you are going to visit that can make you decide what is better to travel by yourself or to travel as a group on a guided visit .
