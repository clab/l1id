I agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
While there are many reasons for my belief , two of the most important ones are that they can explain to every one the ideas that they learned and they can use those ideas in their personal life .
These beliefs deserve further examination in order to understand my belief that the students can learn easier any idea when they understand completly it .

The first reason of my belief that the students will have the capacity of explain not only to the techer , but also to anybody what he understand with many details .
For example , When any student have completly understanding what he is doing can have easier knowledge of the idea that he is working .
One of the best experiences that I had ever had was when I was student and I learned to to mix the quemicals in the chemistry lab , I really coud have my mind on it and I knew the reason why , so I could help some of my friends .
Therefore understand what we see and read is the basic part to learn .

Next , If the student understood in a clear way some ideas he will be able to use it in his personal life .
He can find the reason why learn and understand have a bonding that help to memorise easier .
For instance , understand concepts helps to develop the concentration .
Concequently , the student shoul have more concentratrion about more issues .

In conclusion , have a good understanding of concepts and ideas is a basic issue for learn .
If a student understand clarly can have much more opportunities in his future life because will be able to demonstrate his capacities
