People that try new things and that take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well , are considered successfull .

A succesfull person is someone who is open minded .
This person is always willing to do something else , to try new and varied experiences in life , and always learned from the experience .
That person will not care if someday she will have to go to another part of the world , to run an office there , she will only see it as a new ecperience in life and as an adventure .

Another point is to take risks .
Life is full of risks and people should be ready to face them with optimism .
If people stay always doing the same they will live in a monotonous world , and this will only cause them to get bored of what they are doing and stop believing on themselfs .
Instead an optimistic and succesfull person will always find the way of tuning that into an expereince given by life , find the positive side of it , or in other cases they will see this as a lesson to learn , and so they will change what they are doing or the job they are at .

An example of a succesfull person , is someone that , is starting a new company .
This is taken as a risk , but as a risk that is worth trying .
Changing the way of living , that you have always been used to , into a wild and adventurous life , full of travels in which you meet new people , and learn a lesson of life from them , that later on you could apply on a company , is also concidered as a quality .

Humans learn from mistakes , they teach you life lessons that you could only gain by facing new experiences .
Trassspasing the save side of life , and taking risks , in any type of way , no matter if you make mistakes or if you regret it , will always be a price you recive .

This qualities I believe make a person successful
