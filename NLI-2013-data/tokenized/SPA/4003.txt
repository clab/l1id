First of all , I thing this statement is something very common to listen nowadays , but I think it is n't true .

Each new year it is true than the young people is more busy in a lot of things , but It 's a social problem , bacause they have to study , to work , to learn other languages , and more to can find a good job .

I think this is the main reason to say that the young people do not give enouth time to helping their communities , but do n't they study to improves their knowledges and with them help their communities ?

I think so !

For example , lot of young people use their summer holidays to go to places where they can rebuild old buildings , or help old people , ...

On the other hand , I suppose that is very important the education that they have received in their houses , if their parents were woried about teach them the importance of the enviroment , helping old people or mantein the places cleaned , I think they try to have enough time to do that .

However , I can understand the statement bacause nowadays everybody live very fast , I mean , you have to do one thousand of thinks during the day and frecuently you have n't time to think about all that isuues , nevertherless not only young people , but also everybody .

Finally , I wish everybody had a little time a week to think about this and do something to solve this problem .
