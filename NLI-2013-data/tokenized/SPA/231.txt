the best way to travel is in a grup led by a tour guide

I agree because if you have a person that know about the place that you are going to or you are visiting , he can give you an explain about the history , about the lifestile , the culture , the food , etc. in the other way if you go somewhere and you do not know nothing about it , for example where is a museum , a typical place , a chuch , etc. then you have to search for yourself all the places that you should visit and it problably will take you some time , that you can spend in other places .

For example if you go alone to the Mexico city i am sure that you will lost on the center town , although Mexico is a very small city .

in addition if you have a tour guide , you can ask himfor everything that you want. a tour guide is a person that knows the meaning of the places .
is was for they are working and they enjoy explay people about the places they have known and learning .

if you are thinking on do a travel without a tour guide you have to study perfectly the place where you want to go just for you can find all the thins that are representatives in that conutry .

other reason is bacause all the people do not act in the same way .
i mean taht if you nedd some help or ask about a street maybe you do not have someone to ask and ypo will be alone .
if you have a tour guide he takes you everywhere you want .

the condition of have a tour guide is only tha t you have to pay for their service , but i think that is more important have a nice vacation without troubles or accidents than have a vacation where you were all the time stressed .
