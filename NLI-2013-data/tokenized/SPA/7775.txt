The question about hiring a tour guide or not when traveling to a new place can raise a controversy .
On the one hand , you know what to expect when taking a tour .
On the other hand , you would totally depend on the guide 's timing , schedules and particular inclinations to visit some places and leave others aside .
I believe traveling in a group led by a tour guide leaves no room to particular experiences while traveling .

It cannot be denied that tours are organized and save time as they know where to go and what would be the most efficient itinerary do do so .
As they know the places , they wo n't waste time asking for directions or going to `` famous empty spots '' listed on travel guides .
This is a great advantage as available time to travel is usually very limited .

However , due to time constrains , tour-guides usually limit the visits to landmarks and leave aside important things as beautiful landscapes or `` live-experiences '' .
In fact , time is so short that many interesting things are seen from the window of a bus .
It must be very frustrating to go to Paris to hear a tour guide saying `` on your left is the Louvre Museum '' instead of actually visiting it .

Moreover , traveling in a tour-guide led group is far more expensive than traveling on your own , thus limiting the posibilities of many people to do so .
In addition , if you liked a particular spot , for instance the Louvre Museum , you do n't have the flexibility to stay longer , but instead you 're limited by inflexible schedules .

In conclusion , I believe that even if traveling in a tour guide led group can be more time efficient that doing so on your own , it 's expensive , inflexible and limiting .
A better experience can be held by traveling on your own , provided that a prior assessment and good planning of the trip are done .
