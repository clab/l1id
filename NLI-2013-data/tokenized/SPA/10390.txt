Definitly I agree with Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because they are the moldel to others to be in advance with the people who are common and tradisionlist .

People that no follow the rutine and take risks usually are successful , in a high scale and always are trying to go ahead of the rutine and the society that traditional or common people do .

People who take chances , have the vision to improve every day for them and indirectly for the people arround , for exemple people with vision are working for improve the systems on the jobs , or at least how improve the time in every aspects .

Successful people , always are ahead becoming in lider , that is why the presidents of the big companies , deans in the universities , politicians in our countries are succed .
they avoid the rutine of the common people .
the do investments not only economics , educationals , and that is they are succesful .

The people that follow what they only know , do n't take chances and their lives torn boaring without hope in the future , and this can be part of the consecuences in countries of the therd word do not proggres and during the time only follow what succesful people such as countries ahead improve it 's people .

I prefer successful people
