The world today demands for students to understand that an education is a tool that is used to `` keep the world going . ''
Now , many students choose to learn the bare minimum to get by in their professional careers , and are exempting from their lives that understanding concepts and ideas is more important than to just learn quick facts .

In my experience understading a specific subject in a class has enriched my learning abilities , and given me the satisfaction of understanding every detail of that specific course .
I have seen many of my classmates barely get by through school , because they rely on learning quick facts , pass coursed , and then receive a diploma so they can join the work force .
I strongly belive that they join the real world unprepared .
The student body that uses facts as a method of learning will have incovienient disabilities understanding concepts later in life becuase they will not know how to analyze situations correctly and solve problems .
As simple as a fact can be , it may influence learning significantly , for example , Fact : If students use the method `` memory dump '' as soon as they receive the test , it will help them to do better .
Well , If students would rely more on understading the subject matter and the ideas they are being tested on prior to the exam , they would not have to rely on `` memory dump . ''
I am in complete accordance with students experiencing life through understading concepts and ideas , since this way they may always be able to spread their knowlege with other people .
Just imagine living life with only facts , that many times are uneccessary and vague , whereas to live life with the full knowledge that you can explain or simply express any topic due to the understading you aquired during your learning period .
