This essay will examine the question of whether or not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It seems pretty obvious that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The first example that comes to mind are the pictures of food at fast food restaurants .
One sees a perfectly looking hamburger in the picture , with fresh lettuce and tomatos and a enormous piece of meat , but when you actually get the hamburger you find yourself dissapointed looking at a squashed hamburguer bread with barely anything in it .
We could add many more amusing examples .
For instance consider all the weight-loss products .
The advertisement shows a before and an after picture of the person using the product .
The before picture is of a heavy ugly looking man , and the after picture is of a handsome fit man ( usually it is not even the same person ) .
In fact the person who actually buys the weight-loss product will soon discover that the miracle solution to his weight problem is nothing but a sham .

The simple truth is that companies have to lie a little in order to get attention for their products .
It is a whole different question whether or not these exagerations or glorifications or even straight - out lies will actually help sell the product .
It seems clear that consumers will stop buying a certain product that is made to look good in an advertisement if in reality it does n't work or is much worse than it appeared to be .
So producers have to realize that overdoing it on the exageration will end up backfiring on them .
Companies must add a little truth into their advertisements in order to make their products more appealing to consumers , even if that means reducing the charm of their product .
After all , the consumer will make the company suffer if the product it attempts to sell is garbage compared to the advertisement .
