In the case of Latin America I think that is better to have a broad knowledment of different subjets because you can manage more activities and realize multi-task jobs .

In my own experience , to find a job the recluiters ask you not for specific knowledge in a specific field .
They ask you more about the knowledge in different areas that can help you to solve problems .
In addition , when I was working I learned about diffrerent subjects because my job demand it .
For example , I am Electrical Engineering so I have a background in electronics and technical aspects , my last work was Project Management so I learned about Risk of the projects , financial stuffs , logistics , manage of human resources .

I have friend , he 's profession is architect and he read a lot about different subjects because he is trying to apply the mathematics , the psicology , and the maketing to the decoration of a room .
He analizes the psicological profile of his clients and try to design according with their interest and hobbies .

The people who have broader knowledment can manage more tasks and can make the jobs that others dont know .
Its easier to explain how to make something to a person who has knowledge in more fields .

On the other hand , some activities requires specialized resources for example people who repair , and build airplanes .
Those works need specialized knowledge , but needs more years of specializacion in a field .

In conclusion , I 'm agree with the statement because for the society its better to have people with knowledge of different branches .
In the case of Latin America the people can make multi task jobs .
