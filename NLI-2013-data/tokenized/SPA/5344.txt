When people think of making an advertisement for any kind of purpose , they always want to make consumers to get the right idea , or at least understand it .
For this purpose to function , the advertisement has to be perfect .
So , it may be true that adevertisements make products look better than they really are , although that does n't mean the product is bad .

The purpose for advertisement is to sell , or to change ways of thinking in peoples mind .
An easy example , is fast food restaurants .
They will never give a product as good as it appears in menu , but you will still buy it .
This means that since the moment you leave that restaurant , you will always now that the meal you had will not look like he one in the menu .
Still the restaurant will keep on adevertising their new meals or new promotions in the street or in their menu 's to create a confussion on the costumers mind , but make them think that the meal looks exactly as it is in the adevertisement .

If advertisements were not as perfect as they are today , they would not sell .
The point is to make people decide for something that they may no be convinced for .
So , if the advertisement shows the perfect way for people to get convinced for something , why not make them better than they really are .

This may create problems also , because you can loose clients everytime you give them something that is not what they expected , but as I said at the beginning the advetisement can be better than the real product , but it does n't mean that the prodcut is bad .
Maybe the client can no be as satisfied at the beginning but if the company tries its best apart of the advertisement to make the costumer think the product is good , this one will forget how the advertisement looked like .

In conlusion , the advertisement is a part of a strategy to sell products , but it is the first one to be seen by future custumers .
This means that its good to make them better than they really are , but there has to be a good job to satisfy the client in the moment of purchase and the moment of atending the cliente so the product will never be a bad product , although it seems better in the advertisement .
