Having a chance to travel is most definitely one of the things people prefer to do as a way to relax , rest and enjoy intercultural experiences .
Of course this all depends on the nature of the trip , so this essay will restrict itself to `` pleasure traveling '' exclusively .
In my opinion traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good or bad option depending on the real purpose of the trip as well as on the traveler 's preferences and personality .

If the traveler or travelers are seeking an intercultural experience and do not resent being told were and when to go , then a group led by a tour guide is most definetely a good option .
A guide will show them to all the right places and not only that , but he or she will provide pertinent information regarding the historical , cultural and/or artistical background of such places .
This may enhance their entire traveling experience .
Another good reason why people may prefer traveling in groups is safety .
Visiting an entirely different country where they might not be able to communicate may scare some people .
Having a guide as an interpreter and mediator might encourage taking the trip .
The cultural shock is therefore decreased .
Some people might also enjoy traveling in groups since they might get a chance to interact with different people and make friends during the trip .
Finally , having a tour guide can help reduce costs ( assuming transportation is provided ) and may also help reduce lost time ( time spent in getting to know the place and moving around ) .

On the other hand , if the place targeted to visit lacks all the cultural background that a tour guide might provide ( for example a beach ) , then maybe a guided trip may not be necessary .
The decision also depends on the person 's personality .
Some people dislike traveling in groups , having to follow strict time schedules , and following rules .
If their trip is planned specifically for leisure and rest , then maybe a hectic touring shedule might not be a good idea .
Some people resent not being able to have their privacy or having to spend money on a guide when the `` can get around places by themselves '' .

In conclusion , I believe that `` the best way to travel '' , having or not having a tour guide , depends entirely on the traveler and purpose of the trip .
People wishing to travel should evaluate these things carefully before engaging in a trip that may or may not be led by a tour guide .
