I do agree with the fact that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to understand facts .
I base this agreement basically in personal experience , but also because it has been proved that it 's the best way of learning things .
That does n't mean that we have to avoid facts and leave them to concrete moments , sometimes facts are useful in a special ocassion , but it 's common that facts are forgetful than general concepts .

It 's like building a house .
It 's important to have a toilet in the house , or a bed .
But if the house has n't got a solid structure , the bed or the toilet do n't mean anything , because they 're going to be destroyed one way or another .
But if the structure is solid , the house will remain in its place and the toilet will be able to be in the place a toilet has to be .
Sometimes , it 's going to have problems , like everything and everyone , but it 's going to be there .

When a person is learning a new thing , whether if it 's a new concept or a whole new subjetc , it 's necessary for that person to have some clear ideas before introducing any more information in his head .
The person needs a map of the new thing in his brain .
The risk will be that if those general ideas are not clear , the ones that are going to come after are going to be forgotten , because the person does n't know where to situate them .
If the ideas are clear , the person is going to asimilate the facts easier and it 's going to be harder for him to forget them .

For example , about some months ago I had to learn how to use an editing program called Avid .
The fist lessons that I took were a chaos , nobody undestood how that program worked out , and when the teacher showed us special features inside it , we ended the lessons worst than before , because we were able to see a whole mess of a program with no order inside it .

In the moment we learned how to use the program , how the different formats worked , we were able to use all its special features .
And not only that but now we 're learning another postproduction program , and what took us about two months to learn with the Avid , tooked us three lessons with the new one , just because we had in our mind the general idea of how postproductions programs work .
