We live in a society that depends on technology for everything , cars , motorcycles , airplains , TV 's , DVD 's , anything that we can imagine or think about needing its already there , so naturally we get bomberded by the media with a lot of products that are not useful , a and most of the time they dont even work !
that 's why I believe that advertisements make products seem better than they really are .

Now days we as a society have developed , a comsuming disease !
everything new that comes up we need , but eventually after months of using the products we stop using them !
so the rates star to come down !
what is the first thing enterprises do ?
they tell lies !
and we have such a fragil mind that just because we saw that it works on TV , or hear it on the radio , we buy it again an , again , an gain .

Another problem , will be that the media uses artits in their advertisements to promote and to increase sales , this usally causes a person to buy a product that is not healthy , that not only does not serves it 's porpuses , but in must cases can harm you !
only because the girl holding the coke has a great body , does not mean your gonna get one if you drink one , or becauuse a a guy uses a certain type of lotion he is going to get all the females to go after him , or that if Brad Pitt drives an Audi , you have a chance to become a super star by buying one for yourself !

in conclusion , our community gets affected by the media , advertisments , magazines and all sorts of things telling us what to do or what not to do , what to wear or what not wear , so we end up buying things that we dont need or want , products that are not effective or usefull , OR WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL , just because we are led to believe by advertisements that , that 's in fact what we need , just by making products seem better that they really are !
