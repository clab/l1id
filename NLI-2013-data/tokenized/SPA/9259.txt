While many people think that it is more important for student to undertand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , I think that a stronger case can be made by pointing out that learning about facts and real cases of life can give the student the opportinity to re-live togheter with the people invloved in those cases the situation which they went through .
It is important to undertant well the concepts but nothing as study a real case .
Learning cases method leads the students to a group of posible solutions and teaches them how those solutions affect the final result .

However to get involved in the facts and real life cases , needs a previous preparation obtained not only by the well understanding of ideas related to the fact , but also by the study of all the material concerning the case .

In many universities programs , the profesors make a well balance combination of both methods and they obtain very good results .
First they prepare the ideas and material to be learned by the students and after they present the real fact .
It permits the student to apply their recent acquired knoledge and give their best result in order to reach a solution .
Not only the result gived by the student , but the final solution is then compared with what really happend .
It allows students to know wich solution to the problem was right and wich one was wrong .

A survey made by People Maganize by the end of the year 2002 , shown that the learn real facts methods had a better approach of the right solutions to a specific problem that had the traditional method of just understand the ideas without application .
There also exists thoudands of studies that support this topic .

For that reason I think that undertanding ideas alone without application in real life , is not much a good method as it is the applicability in already lived cases .
