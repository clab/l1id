The world is turning to be a more demanding place , especially when refering to the work enviroment .
Many people think that it is better to study a very specific topic and hope to be accepted in a company that works with this field of knowledge , while other perople think that it is convenient to study as many different but related subjects so that his job will become easyer for him to do .

The person that has knowledge in different topis is a complet person compared to one that only focuses on one subject .
Knowing that for example there are more and more foundings when refering to science , a perosn every day more finds the time and will to study interrelated subjects to the specific topic he works for , like in the case of a medical doctor : every day there are new findings of any disease that imply a minimun knoledge in chemistry or physics and if a doctor only focuses on the anatomic part of the person or on the biological part of the problem , he may sometimes not be able to figure out what is happening to the person , if instead this physician is aware of new findings and has taken courses about realted subjects , he will not necessarilly have a hard time knowing what the problem is .

Science cannot live without history for the studies of any situation or as we know history cannot exist without facts that occur in a society , that could involve art or science findings or political situations that are then trully link to one another .

Sooner or later we will all agree with the fact that sciences , history subjects , art majors or any other possible topics will all be in need of each other ( if not are ) and that they all come toghether to form the world that we are today .
