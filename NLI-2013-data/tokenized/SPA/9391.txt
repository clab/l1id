Students can learn facts , but not necessarily understand them .
It is essential for any student to comprehend concepts in order to take advantage of what he or she has understood .
Learning facts might be useful if students understand and know to apply them .
Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .

A student who understands an idea is able to use it and put it into practice because he or she masters it .
For instance , understanding how temperature affects gas expansion will allow students to know when it is a good time to fill a car wheel with air .
However , if a student simply learns that higher temperatures tend to expand a gas , this concept will only be general knowledge and probably not useful for him or her .
In other words , understanding

When a student understands , he or she is expanding his or her knowledge as well .
Although learning facts also expands our views of the world , understanding is a far-reaching tool that might be benefitial to achieve good goals .
Understanding might help students in using ideas and concepts to solve real-life problems .
For example , imaging someone having problems taking out the grease of the dishes with only water .
If that person understnads the effect of soap in water , he or she will go and use soap .

Likewise , understanding ideas and concepts helps students to be more creative .
Students who have understood something are likely to look for new ways to apply to knowledge gained .
For instance , understanding

Consequently , it is very important to understand ideas and concepts in order for them to be useful .
Just learning facts has probably a negative impact on students because it only augments the knowledge the person has , and does not help him or her at all .
