I believe that both things are necessary .
This is a great question and also it could be a big dilemma .
Based on my own experience is how i reach this conclusion .

Nowadays i am dentist , but i just got my degree five months ago .
While i was still in my fourth year of university , i came up with the same question .
I was a very good student with high grades , but all i could talk to people about was teeth and the oral cavity .
I even used to say , as a joke , that i had tooth-shaped brain !

I felt really bad about my reality so i looked forward to find an extracurricular activity that had nothing to do with dentistry .
Thus i registered myself for the Selection of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in the World Model of the United Nations ( WorldMUN ) .

WorldMUN is an event organized by Harvard University with the purpose of gathering students from universities from all over the world , in order to discuss the current agenda of the UN ; in other words , students play the role of diplomatics that defend the position of certain country , regarding an especific topic of real life .

I have to admit that it was quiet hard for me because the training process implied to study and know many things about general culture , universal history and current world events , and those where subjects i was not familiar with at all .
But after a huge effort , i finally got to go to Beijing , China in march of this year , with 28 other UCV students .
The team got the first prize among more than 200 other universities from around the world .

That does not mean that i am not interested anymore in getting an specialization of my career .
On the contrary `` i want '' now to do an oral and maxillo-facial surgery specialization .

So my conclusion is that someone does not need to be completely in favor of one option , i believe that one person can manage him or herself to have knowledge in many academic subjects , but at the same time , he or she can have a specialization .

The mind has no limits , you put the limits !
