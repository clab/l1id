Traveling is an experience that is extremly related with every individual 's personality , style of life , and interests .
That is why people travel in very different ways and there is always a market for every type of traveler .
For me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable ways of traveling since I am an adventurer and in those kinds of trips it is difficult to get so much flexibility as I like .
Traveling for me is one of the best ways to form our own personality and to have experiences that will shape our life for ever .
When you have a tour gide , the possibilities of achieving those experiences will be drastically limited because you will always be lead by another person 's point of view .

Visiting museums , ruins , antique buildings and all of the rich historical places for me is what makes the difference on a trip but being led by a tour guide on all of them is not the kind of experience I would like .
It is important to have a guide while visiting historical places because you learn things that by yourself you would never have discovered but , the problem is when the guide is the same person in all of them like in most tour guided trips .

When groups travel with one guide they recive the point of view of only one person everywhere they go .
I believe that history is is closely related with facts but those facts are always related with the historian 's point of view , tour guides as every person who knows about history imply their opinion on their explenations and by listening only to one person will limitate us to create our own judgement .

Flexibility is also very important for me when traveling .
I am a kind of person who likes to decide every detail of the trip and by having a tour guide you are not able to do those kinds of desicions .
Also I belive that doing several things with out planing are always fun because the experience will be always different .
This way we meet different people , we live things that we thought we never would and finally I could say that we are able to enjoy things that we thought were not going to happen .

Traveling , meeting new people , living new experiences , has made me the person I am now .
I do not like to be led by someone else .
I think that defending my personal opinion is the most important thing I can do .
Traveling with a tour guide may be the best way for traveling for many people but for me traveling is so personal that it has to be an experience compleatly of your own .
