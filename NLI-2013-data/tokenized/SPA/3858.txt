When was the last time you spend just an hour helping another person ?
All of us -- not only young peopole -- may think about this question , because nowadays we 've became more selfish , completely dedicated to our own lifes and sometimes we do n't realize that there 's a lot of people around us that are less priviledged and need help .
Therefore , it 's true that now we do n't give enough time to helping our communities .

I think that there are several factors that explain this behaviour .
Firstable , society does n't recognized this contribution , but instead of it , you 're better if you get two majors , an excellent job , buy a car and a house and live with all the conveniences .
So , we spend our time trying to get these goals and forgetting about the community .

A second factor could be that nowadays the time is the most appreciated value .
The companies pay us for our time , we spend a lot of time working , and free-time is very important for us .
Working on a ONG project will take us a lot of free and not revenued time , so we prefer not to do it .
To illustrate this point I can talk about my own experience .
While I was working for an advertising agency I tried to spend more time helping the others , I felt that I had to do it .
I contacted to ` Aldeas Infantiles ' ( a childhood project ) and I spent a year teaching children and playing with them just Friday afternoons .

In the end I decided to quit the project because I worked at the office son many hours than then I did n't have enough time to see my boyfriend and my family .
I realized that time was too much important if you do n't have enough .

In short , although it 's difficult to have enough time for all , we have to try it and spend maybe just an hour a week helping our community .
