The question about whether it is better to have a broad knowledge or to be specialized is very controversial .
One may argue that it is preferable to be familiar with as many subjects as possible , since this will lead to be better suited to different situations .
On the other hand , there is the claim that since human knowledge is so broad that it is not only impossible but unpratical to avoid specialization .
As a final position , I 'll argue why nowdays its better to specialized .
In paticular , I will illustrate this by explaining the situation of nowdays mathematicians .

First I would like to explain why to have a meaninful broad knowledge is almost impossible .
By meaninful knowledge , I understand an amount suited to do reasearch on a specific subject or make contributions to it .
Just considering the especific case of mathematics , nowdays it has become so broad that even a Master thesis may be hardly understood by people not specialized in the subject .
So if someone is not specialized in any field , there are chances that he will not understand the state of the art of the mathematical sciences .
Even , there is people who tries to specialized in every possible fields , and what generally happends is that the person becomes a very good lecturer but a poor researcher .
My point is that mathematics is too broad to avoid specialization .
So the aim of obtaining a broad mathematical knowledge will lead to someone that would hardly be able to excel as a researcher .

This leads to my second argument .
Nowdays an academic person is many times measured based on the amount of original results he produces .
That means that not only the person is required to be on the edge of our knowledge , but aquainted enough with it so that to understand how to and be able to expand it .
So in order to obtain a possition as a researcher is better for him to be specialized .
And as a matter of fact , only a researcher can aim for a trully broad knowledge in a particular science .

As a conclusion , given the fact that it is impossible to have and unpractical to aim for a broad knowledge in mathematics , it is even less desirable in general .
