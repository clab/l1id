Many people beleave that young people enjoy life more than older people do , as well as diferent cultures can agree or desagree on this asumption by their contribution to their culture 's development .

In some groups , cultures or families , young people are defined to be the motor of the group grouth , becouse they are suposed to studdy when they are young in orther to reach a high intelectual capability to create grouth and diminish poverty , in this particular groups , young people have more free time to studdy , travel and play sports in order to experience and learn what they need to .
So , for this groups , young people certainly enjoy life more than older people do .

On the other hand there are cultures or groups which beleave that young people have to work day and night because the older they get , the most knowledge they acumulate in order to become leaders of the culture .
Because of this , older people are rewarded by being able to make desitions about the group 's future and enjoy life .

from my perspective , today , we have the freedom to deside weather I enjoy more life when I 'm young or older , persons do n't belong to a comunity that tels them what to do , they deside if they want to be part of the comunity who travels , partys , plays sports and does n't do much during their first years of life , in order to work during their mid age until they are older .
Or to be part of a comunity who studies very hard and focusess on their profetional goals in order to have a retirement plan that will gives them the oportunity , solvency and calm to enjoy life .

In conclution I desagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , every person should deside when to enjoy life , that shoud be every person 's goal in life , to have the posibility to chouse what fits their personal nesecities .
