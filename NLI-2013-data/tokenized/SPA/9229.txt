Well as a student I will say and understanding is basic not matter if is and idea concepts or a fact , the point is all depens if is for a comon use or for a class , or living .

What I try to say is all are important to undestand , what difers is who we use sometimes is better to have the idea of something becouse it let us our mine opend to descover more and undestand better becouse is how we undestand or persive the idea .
When we have a concepts is not much that we can change becouse is that way it is exemple a concept of a anatomy where blood are red cells , is not much that we can change we leran like that .
Now if we talk about facts is something proved by cientific laws , gravity is a fact .

As a student we need to accept some information as idea where can be personal or toughts form someone , concepts where we need to learnd , and facts .
I thing the diference in all is facts you can not change , concept you can learn in diferent ways and finally understand , and ideas is what you creeat , form something you see , you hear or feel , and can be change .

Facts , concepts and ideas are importan for a student , not matter what is study ,

For sure the person that study chimestry facts are every where , and it may be learn and no so well undestud , and other case a person that study politic science , what matters more are the ideas how interpres tha concepts , and maybe for someone that study biology concepts are really important and must to be undestud .

For more or less , Ideas concepts and facts are importan when we are learning , I thing how it works is we get the idea , then we analize then we undestand .
wether is a idea , concept or a fact .
