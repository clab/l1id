From my point of view having broad knowledge of many academic subjects might sound to many people boring and at some point useless .
Why would someone study more when you can just specialize in one specific subject and be ready for the world in a shorter period of time ?

I kind of disagree with the statement presented .
I believe that the more you know , the more you are prepared for life .
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects might help you to develop yourself more as a person and as a profesional .
When you specialize in one specific subject , you might be missing the chance of learning more and being more complete .
You limit yourself to not to go forward , not to learn more about things that might interest you and to not be even more prepared at a profesional scale .

I do not mean that specializing in one specific subject is the biggest mistake you could possibly ever make in your life , but i do think that we have a lot to learn and that we never stop learning .

Knowing more does not harm anyone and may bring you piece of mind .
It feels great when you realize how much you know about some subjects which at some point you found useless to know about before , but when the time comes you realize how wrong you would have been if you would not have made the decision of amplify your horizons and learning as much as you can learn .
For example , learning another language is a really good thing to do .
You never really know when could you actually be needing that second language until you find yourself in the need of it .
Many companies want that their employees could talk at least one or two more languages than the one which is their mother language , but unfortunately not everybody is prepared .

Being prepared is about having the enough knowledge that could guide you through life .
