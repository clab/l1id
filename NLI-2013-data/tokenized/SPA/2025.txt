Being young people imply to have more physical and psichological energy to enjoy of life , however the experience on life and the years acumulated could lead in give more energy to older people to enyoy their existencie .

Years give more knowledge to take more advantage of their life in different areas .
An old person enjoy more of the simple things as the nature , people and experiences , due to they have different phylopsophy of life .
The mature people during their life acumulate different kinds experiences and memories that probably link to relate every new event with their past .
Moreover , these have double satisfaction for them experimenting a new experience and joining with the past events .
For example my grandmother , 76 years old , she always enjoyed more when we go to visit the National Park in my country because she could remember the times before that she came , and at the same time her new experience with her grandchildren make her feel so happy when she has the opportunity to tell her stories related with that visit .
Simple thinks like that visit and bring their back memories enjoy more the old people that probably any joung people could enjoy .

Older people have incorporated inside the clock of life is running faster for them for that reason every moment is taking as a last .
With this thinking probably they can see the world different than the young people who are always busy in their studies or jobs .
Old people have more time to enjoy because at this age they dont work .
They can feel with more intensity the relief of stress of no being working .

The experience of the years teach them to appreciate the nature of the world and enjoy of it , they take more attention at the beauty of the a flower instead of being worry the trivials problems as a young people is involved .
