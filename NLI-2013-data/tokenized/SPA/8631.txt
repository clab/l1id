In any kind of educative , teaching , or learning institution , there are many ways in which classes ( specifically academic ) are imparted .
Many teachers like their students to understand the ideas and concepts they are learning , and other teachers like them to learn about the same things by teaching facts about it .
According to both of this ideas of learning , is it better to undersand ideas and concepts of certain topic ?
Or is it better to learn the facts about the same topic ?

I think that it is very important to learn facts about any topic you want to learn about .
Learning facts is something that will help you in the future because they are very useful .
For example , learning the facts about certain Roman leader who lost the empire will help you in the future , if you are a leader of any kind of institution , to avoid commiting the same mistakes as he did .
Another important thing about facts is that they can never be changed and that most of them are important to know about in order to understand people who are `` experts '' in the career you are applying to .
In that way , you would understand what they 're talking about if they mention any of these facts .
Finally , facts are important because they full-fill your general knowledge on many aspects ( as they say : knowledge is power ) .

In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts about any topic is something very important in life .
Understanding ideas and concepts about anything will help you to apply these same ideas and topics in the future and make things right , thus becoming a practical person .
When you understand a concept or an idea , you do n't need to learn anymore about it because then you can use it or apply in any way you want , especially in a job or a career .
When you understand a concept , you can even explain it in many ways or in your own words ( it 's better than memorizing things ) .
If you understand an idea , then you can apply the knowledge you have about it and turn it into something practical .
For example , if you study to be a mechanical engineer , and you understand the whole concept of car motors , then you can be able to use this concept to fix motors , or to explain or teach others about motors in a simpler way than how you learned it , so that they can apply the concept in a practical way .
In this example , if you keep doing this or applying your concepts on motors , you can even become the owner of an important car company or an important workshop .

After these explanations and showing my reasoning , I think I agree with the statement that says `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
This probably sounds too rude , buy I really think it is better to be a practical person than just being a `` smartass '' , and you can achieve this by understanding ideas and concepts as a student to apply them afterwards in real life .
And who knows , maybe if you do this , in the future these ideas or concepts may help in your career or in any day life event .
This is why I completely agree with the statement expressed before .
