Many people hold the view that products are as good as they seem to be in advertisements .
I do not agree with them and I am going to explain now the reasons that support my point of view .

As far as I am considered , advertisements use to emphasized too much their products .
They try to show it as it were the best onje of the market .
Lets take television advertisements .
Normally , they present their product with relaxing music , showing their best characteristics , in a nice atmosphere , to name a few .
People at home imagine himself with this product and say : '' oh !
how beautiful would be my life if I buy it ... ''
We do n't realize that they are cheating us .

However , people are not silly either stupid and know that the product it is not as good as its appearence .
From my point of view , children are not as strong as adults and tend to believe thats true .
That is why before Christmas there are som many plays and dolls advertisements .
Take mi sister for example .
She is nine and last summer said that she wants a new doll she watched onj T.V.For her , it was the best one .
It was fantastic .
My parents bought it as a Bithday present .
After some days , she realize it was not so fantastic as it seems in the T.V. adevertisements .

In conclusion , I found unfair people 's behaviour suplying their product but , I can also understand them .
In a supply and demand market everything is allowed They need to earn money to live and that 's a different way to do it .
Each one survive as well as it is possible .
