Although some people prefer to say that the advertisements show what you got , I prefer to say that this might not be the case .
In my opinion , The people that make those advertisements not only have a gap in the knowledge of about the characteristics of the product , but also they have a good knowledge about how to use secret messages that makes the product essay to sell .

In the following essay , I will defend my opinion with pertinet reasons and illustrative examples .
Most of the people that meke advertisments for whatever product is on sell , they realy do n't know the characteristics about the product .
If some company is seeling shampoos for example , they are not going to tell you the specifics about that shampoo .
Even more , they wo n't show those characteristics that makes the product cheap on the at .
they prefer to show us only the good things about that product .
I believe , that this happen because the companies want to make money as soon as they can , and they do n't pay attention on waht is realy important for costumers .

They realy know how to sell the product , not because they studyied the product , like the shampoo I just said above , they realy know how to sell the product because they sometimes use secret messages on their advertisements .
For example , they show up on their advertisements nude women , they use sex to sell , and as a result of that they sell more and more shampoos , because everybody wants to look like that woman or that man .

In the essay above , I have defended my choice with pertinent reasons and examples .
As you can see , I rather buy my staff not paying attention at the advertisements , and I strongly recomend to get more knowledge about the staff that you are just going to buy .
