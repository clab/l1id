The ideas and concepts world or the simple fact world .
When anybody thinks about what type of education preffer for the young students , he or she asks about what world likes for them and what kind of live chosses .

The life world is divided in two forms of understanding the live , one of them is focused on the facts that the students need to know to be succsesfull , that suport all of thesse activities .
On the other hand , the other form is based on the ideas and the concepts that the young students needs to understand for their real development .

The people who think that the principal focused that need to have the school is lern to the students all the facts that ocurred in the world because with that , the students could be betters and could be find a job in somewhere and doing something because have the knowledge that permit to do that whaatever the student like

In the opposite , the people who think that the important lenrned for the students in the schools is to have an criterion and the posibility for distinguish the important idea and relevant concept any activity or intellectual development , preffer that the professors insist in teach about who anybody needs to think and how is that people needs to undertand the importance of the ideas .

So the most important question is if one of both concepts is the most important for the development of the students or if the students needs the cojunction of both concepts to find a real development and a real knowledge for the life and for the oportunities of works that he or she find .

I think that the better teacher is a man that teach about the ideas and concepts but that ideas and concepts are explinned by the teacher with a real and historical facts because the estudent learn the concept and never forgaot the fact .
