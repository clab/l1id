I completly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Understanding is not only memorizing a fact it is also about interpretating and thinking on what you have learned .
Understanding allows the students to develop creatity that will lead them the solutions to problems they will face in the future .

The fact that a student understands a concept or an idea will help him develop the ability to inovate .
Understanding gives anyone the ability to come up with a new and personal solutions to a problem or situation .

Learning and memorizing is the old way of teaching .
This method does not help the students develop abilities they have and that they are going to need in the future .
Learning or memorizing a fact will not allow the students to think or be creative .
It only helps them adquire new or additional information on a certain topic that they will not be able to use on a different and more adverse scenario .

Today having the ability to understand and interpretate a concept or an idea has led to the improvement of processes and techniques used in many industries .
This improvements can be translated into time and price reduction .
If students do not have the ability to understand they will not create and inovate and their possibilities of success will be narrowed .
They will be in a very difficult situation to compete versus those who do have the ability to understand .

I definitely agree that it is much more important for students to understand ideas or concepts than it is for them to lean facts .
Understanding will led students to have a easier educational career and a more succesfull professional trayectory .
