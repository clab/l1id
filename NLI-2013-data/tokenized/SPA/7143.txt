I totally disgree with this statement since it is completely unfaithfull to reality .
We all know that the world population is gradually growing to its extreme .
Of course , and unfortunatelly , this means a consequential growth of many things , such as cities , houses , polution and waste .
That in twenty years fewer cars would be running through our highways seems trully hard to believe .
It makes sense , more people , more cars .
This is the real statement we should bear in mind , and specially when dealing with today 's materialistic society , eager to adquire more and more without caring about any consequence .
Cars , people say , are the reflection of one 's own whealth , and the better it is or the more you have seems to say much about your self .
Luckily , nowadays the concept ecologism appears to be more settle in our society than a few decades ago .
We could say that the human being is , through time , more and more conscious about his environment , something that undoubtfully changes our bad behavioir towards nature .
Public transportation should be of a daily use in our society since it sure helps to reduce the polution generated by single cars .
It is a perfect way to move through the city while meeting interesting people .
We still have much to do about this issue , but I believe a change is possible .
Maybe not in twenty years , nor probably in 50 , but in some future period the use of cars should be radically reduced .
