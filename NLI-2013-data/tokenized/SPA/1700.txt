To answer if I agree or disagree with this statement , I have to make some distinctions .
There are some profession that need a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and some that do not .

Professions like scientists in specific regions , lets say microbiologists , need a specialization .
That means that they will start to study general biology and later specialize for microbiology .
They might need general knowledge about statictis , mathematics and maybe some terms in the latin lannguage , but they do not need to study economy or philosophy .

On the other hand there are some professions where a broad knowledge is needed .
A director of a movie will need complex understanding of many different subjects .
He will have to deal with actors , so he will need probably some knowledge about psychology .
He will need to understand the finances of this project , have knowleadge about technical issues to communicate with the camera , light and editing team .
Further he will need to outweight the importance of every upcoming problem , where he will need managing skills like timemanagement .

On the other hand , if you have enough time to study what you like and what you are passionate for , it will always be of help .
Nowadays we live in a fast changing world with upcoming challenges .
No jobs will replace ohters and to have diffrent knowledges and skills will always help to increase the amount of possibilites where to work .
I think that one has to see the opportunity costs and listen to one 's heart what is really important for
