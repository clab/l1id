On an economy that is based on the selling of products , going from restaurants , to technology products , to simply grocerys or even real state .
To try your best to sell a product is understandable .
And nowing that traditionaly on many parts of the world , people will buy products not by the way they taste , of they work , but by the way they look or simply because that is the `` thing '' to buy .

Myself being on the restaurant bussines , i ca n't say that i agree or disagree on advertisements making products seem better than what they are .
Reason being that i find myself on both sides of the statement .
I definitly agree that you have to sell a product for what it is , and do n't hide anything , or lie to your customer .
But how do you do , when you are trying to sell the best product on the world , but it just does not look good enough for people to buy .

I identify myself with both sides of the card , on one side , i am the costumer , and i want to buy a product , that do exactly what they do when they shoe it on the adverstisements , i want to go a 5 stars restaurant and get a 5 stars treatment , and a 5 stars food .

On the other side of the card , i understand , that if you need to sell a product , you have to find the way to make your costumers buy your product .

There is nothing wrong to try to to be succesful , as long as your advertisements stay as close as possible to the real thing .
And there is nothing wrong either to ask for what you paid for .
As long as the costumer understands that sometimes adverstisements are going to picture thing as they are not , people are going to try to push things as they are not .
