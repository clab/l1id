Which is the objective of advertising a product ?
It is not to give the consumer a reason to buy that product ?
If your answer to this quatino was yes you will agree to think that is a good behavior to show products much better than they really are .
Now there are some rules on this that we are going to discuss as well .

In real life there are plenty of examples that shows us not just that this practice is really common , but that is a legimit way of positioning a product into the market of today .
If you think about the tv advertisements of the McDonald burgers for example you will see enormous burgers with a lot of things inside and juicy meats .
When you go to the restaurant and ask for that same burger you dont see it the same , right ?
You think they are cheating you because is not the same thing they advertise .
The answer is no , there is no cheating on that scenario .
Even they are showing something that may be different form the real product , the basics of the product are still the same .
The things that you think are changing like size , colors , etc. it is just an ilution , a camera effect that affect the image presented on the screen , but not affect the product .
Here we just see one of the rules that i was sepaking of .
If the advertisement does not change the basics of a product , you can play with the way you present it to the consumers .

Another great example is when a guy that is using a certain perfume is surrounded by beautifull women .
The product that it 's being advertised is the perfume itself , not the situation , or the fact that if you use that perfume you will be surrounded by beautifull women .
This is showing another rule for advertisement .
In this case we are not changing anything in the product but we are creating an image of the kind of persn that will use that product and there is nothing wrong on that .

Having explained that .
I will conclude that it is a valid thing to advertise products much better than they really are .
This is one of the ways companies position their products into the market and introduce them to the costumers .
They use this kind of techniques to create some advantages about similar products that are present in the market .
