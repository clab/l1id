I agree with the statement .
I think that succes in these days has a lot of implications about money and carreer , but I thik that succes it 's not just about these kind of things but about being the best human being that you can be .
And because of this you ca n't really settle for what you think is ok .
Because in order to become more than what you are , you must realize that there are possilbilly other ways for doing things that you just have n't imagine .

A successful person , it 's an innovative one .
Successful people have been changing the world since humans appeared on it .
You just have to think about the way we live now and the way people live two thousand years ago or more .
And everything that we enjoy and give for granted , was somebody 's idea .
Somebody that just wanted to do things a little different or just not like people told him o her thing are suppossed to be , but doing things in his o hers own way .
Innovation will lead to a successful live , as it makes our way of live a better one .

Ambition , will never let you settle with what you have or let you keep doing just what you think you do already well .
Ambition , may blind some people , and thus its has a negative connotation , but , the ambition that makes you always go forward to your next goal its also a very important element of success .
Taking risk its part of life , and peolple who have the determination to take them when it matters , usually are moved by the feeling that out there , there must be something better , something they deserve to have .

So yes , I think that successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
