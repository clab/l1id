When it comes to car use , the tendency seems to be upward sloping and that is why I believe that twenty years from now , there will be more cars than there are today ; but I believe that cars wont be the same as they are today .

Within the past fifty years , the number of cars has grown drastically worldwide .
If we take a look back in time we can easily realize that during the 1950's families were accostumed to having one car if any per household , while today , on the other hand , most families tend to own two cars .
This growth pattern could have been caused by changes that have taken place in society such as the incorporation of more women to the labor force , but the truth is that today we have more cars than we used to .
Therefore , it seems reasonable to expect a continuous increase in the number of automoviles within the next twenty years .

It is true that car use keeps incrementing , but it is also true that now people are more concious of the environmental problems than they were before , and that is why reforms are being put in place in order to reduce car use .
Such reforms include high parking rates and taxes on big automoviles , such as jeeps .
While these reforms seem harsh , the number of cars has not been decreased substancially and that is why I believe that the tendency will continue to be upward sloping .

On the other hand , while I believe that automoviles will keep increasing , their manufacture will have to be more environmentally concious and that is why cars will not be the same as they are today .
A possible change which seems to work is the use of hydroelectric engines ( engines which are electrically powered ) .
These vehicules utilize water tanks in order to generate motion .
Another posibility is incorporating sun pannels in cars , just like the ones which are now used in homes in order to obtain energy from the sun 's rays .
Both these technologies , are less pollutant than the technology implemented in regular cars and that is why it seems reasonable that new cars will implement one of these two .

In conclusion , I believe that the number of cars will continue to grow during the next twenty years , but I also understand that the situation is unsustainable as it is today and that is why car technology will have to change drastically in order to protect our planet from pollution ; therefore , cars will have to change .
