I think that the statement is wrong , not because of what it tells could be false , that could be , but because it leads to a likely huge misunderstanding .
It is not difficult from the statement to infer that young people nowadays have become more selfish and less worrisome about their neighbours or communities .
That is , that they ignore the meaning of the word ` solidarity ' .
And the figures cannot depart from this idea .
A survey conducted last year gauging the enrollment of young people in projects whose aim was to improve the quality of life of the underdogs , showed that the ratios had dramatically plummeted down during the last decade .

We are unable to deny the facts , but being that said , I think that fairness should be put on stage .
It may be true that young people devote less time to help people that really need assistance , but the measure is in absolute terms , not in relative ones .

In order to shed some light on this topic , let us have a look around the duties a young person must face today in comparison to those faced by young people ten o twenty years ago .
If we do so , we will find that it is rather difficult for a young person nowadays to find time to devote to solidarity projects .
Was anybody obliged twenty years ago to speak fluently three languages to get a good job ?
Was the burden of the academic studies so heavy as it is now ?
An extremely competitive society has made people concentrate on themselves , rather than thinking to get their close environment better , not because of disengagement but because of obligation .

This fact will fix the point .
If we take a look at the number of young donors to Non Govermental Organisations ( NGOs ) we will find that the funds have soared during the last few years .
If we asess the enrollment ratios in some of them , like the Red Cross , focusing on periods of vacation like the summer , we will see a similar pattern .

To sum up , young people nowadays devote more time and resources to carry on projects to help their communities relative to the time they can afford .
The problem is that this spare time is scarce .
There is a lack of hours , not of eagerness .
