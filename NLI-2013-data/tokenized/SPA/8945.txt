Going to school is a big issue in life .
It can change it just to many diferent ways .
All this knowledge that you get in all this time make your life much different than those that never takes the chance to go .
That is way people who takes the chance to do it , must have an open mind to understand ideas , concepts and obviusly to learn the facts of any information .

When you are talking a topics let 's say children , you must learn about everything , food , games , sickness , parents etc ..
so this is the idea , `` children '' , but you must learn about concepts , like what is common in them , what is teoric , what is normal in their behaviur , how to treat them , how to talk to them , how to play with them , and when you find all this information and understand , it will be much easier to do everything with them , so this last part will be the Facts .

Per example , to coach children skaters you must know first how to skate , then how to teach childrens , and with all this information you must know how to apply your knowledge in children , and during this time you will find that every single kid is diferent and you have to treat everyone diferent .

To sumarize this subject I must say that any student that is taking any class at school have to memorize , understand different ideas , diferent concepts and of course to learn facts , to have an open mind and in this way to learn in an overall way all information that you are receiving , this is the order in an normal and objective way to learn .
So I must disagree to the autor of this statement because I must said that this 3 concepts must be together in a learning process .
