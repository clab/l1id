I agree with the statement porpoused in wich is stablished that for students it is more important to undertand ideas and concepts than learning facts .

I do have to be clear saying that facts are not as important as concepts and ideas are , but fatcs are not secundary thing without impotance they are really importat in any learning process .

I say this because I am student and I can now be sure that when a teacher begins explaining facts without a theory before that includes different concepts and ideas , the class is really a lack of time , because students maybe understand the facts but do not really learn the theory that it is behind of it .

Althouht it is also inconvinient for learning , when whe as students only recive concepts and ideas but no facts or examples that explains what the teacher is trying to explain , because in this way possibly we learn a teory but we wo n't be capables of ussing it .

A clear example of this matter it is when you try by yourself to read a law , for sure will be very difficult to understand what is regulating , but when a teacher gives you some facts it is much clear and you really understand what is that law trying to regulate .

Finally I do have to accept that when a teacher uses facts that really ecourage students .

So I think I is clrear that concepts are very important but thet sholud be accompai
