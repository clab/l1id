The idea is good to me .
I think that the most important aspect for the wisdom is to understand the ideas and concepts that we have heard in the school .
For the students is important too the comunication with the porfessor .
But no always the situation is the most comfortable for the students and the academic .
Many times , the place where the student show their questions not is in the classroom .
When anybody do n't understand something in the class is necesary to explain other time .
We know that to learn is not a simple work , each mind is different and the level of complexity change in each human .
When a professor is not sure that hir pupils have understood the principal idea of the tem he must do questions about the exposition , if the answeres are correct he can go on but if he comprove the other situation he can teach the problem once more .
But the reality is n't , many time , simple .
The situation is complicate when the people do n't understand nothing about the explication but do n't pay attention or because a problem of concentration .
The pschycological studies have been demostred us that mind work more slowly in this century .
Why , in our century , not only the students , in general , the people have a big problem to understand and learn new things ?
Why our mind work more slowly ?
About this quaestion the pscycologist Richard Frazer says : the television and the other machines , products of the XX century are the cause of the massive slownees of the wordl .
The human thinkS the computer , the television , tha games and others ahve been invented to help us , to do life mor easy and fast , but is no true .
