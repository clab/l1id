Well , I dont think success is a resultant of experiencing risks .
Risk may help to prove oneself new ways of doing things ; new possibilities to aboard issues or face fears and conventionalities .
But I really dont think that by taking risks one can assure for its life success .
The main problem that I detect on the statement is that the concept of success is limited to the risk one .
Fisrt of all we should define what those terms stand for in modern society in order to really understand what are the possibilities involved in that particular process .

For instance , I could be very succesful without risking anything in my life .
I may have proven formulas that have worked for me all my life and that not necessarily make me a succesful person in terms of money and fame , but in my own reference terms , that could be anything regarding a good quality of life , or even not simply that .
If we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern societies that succes may bring to a person , the arguments would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame .

So , why is money and fame the two main references to explain succes from my point of view ?
Because those concepts are the ones that prevail in modern capitalist societies .
Yes , capitalism , far from all the so-called economic benefits that it supposes for mankind , it has also produced a terrible social need for material whealt in order to expose social status and succes .
I may finish my toughts on this topic by referencing the one and only clue to understand postmodernity : `` the more you buy , the more you are ''
