I must say that I totally agree with the statement .
As a student , I personally find more importsnt and useful to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
What is more , I think that the really important thing is not only to understand these ideas and concepts but also to study , to examine and to see how an idea or a concept leads to another and , thus , how facts appear as a part of the process , not as isolated things that are recorded in our memory .

Understanding ideas and facts help students , and people in general , to develope their logic and their analytical capacities .
For example , let ' s talk about the French Revolution .
To me , it is easier and more useful to study it not as an amount of dates , facts , names , events , etc , but as a conclussion of the social and political situation of Europe in the 18th century : One thing leads to another and , at the end , studying it can even be funny , as a film in your mind , better than a long and boring list of non-sense words .

Furthermore , I consider memory a bad friend : You trust in it and , when you most need it , it leaves you alone , with no other help .
When taking and exam , for example .
If in your mind there are only facts , you can forget one and being unable to continue with the answers .
On the contrary , if you have all the understanding process in your mind , maybe you won ' t be able to give a concrete date or a name , but you can explain the context or give other information that can help you to avoid a total disaster .

To sum up , I think that understanding ideas and concepts will help us more than learning facts by heart , not only in our academic life but also in our everyday life .
