It is more importan for students to learn facts because would be better for the students to understand and it also would be more easy to remenber , I not agree with this for meny reasons .

First of all , is more easy for the studens remaid the facts or the esperience that they have because they have being in .
Also they would never forgent that .
For example , When I was in scholl I remenbered tha t I laked to go to the la boratoty to do some experiments and I felt that I never would forget that because l lived le experince .

Second , Is more important for the studets stay in the facs because they can Also show some posibles solutions about whatever problems that the would have and lear abaut this experience , Third , when the studens are in facts of some event , it is more exacted for then because they are living the experience .
Moreover , the studets would be more interested in the subject that they are coursing .
Also they would be better and work successfully .

In conclusion , For all these reasons I agree whit is more important for the students lear facts than learn abao the ideas and conceps .
