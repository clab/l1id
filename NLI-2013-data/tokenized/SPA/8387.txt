I think that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because once they have clear in their minds the concepst about some article , called science , mat , phycology , any thing tha they are learning , it is posible to follow up with the learning procecess .
I completly agree , when i have idea of what my professror is talking about , when i comprhended the bases of any discoution , is the point to opened the door to the understatndin and after , i can memorize and learn the facts .

Many times students , include myself , are seeting in a class , where the professor is showing the facts , but seems like professor and student most forget that how can you have an example or talk about a fact with out understand the mean idea .

I am in a nursing class for example , if i do not understand the idea or concepts about the heart mechanisms , how the heart works , how the blood it is pump , thense i will never understant the fact tha a patient is having a heart attack due to high blood pressure .
It is really important for any student , of any profetion , for any area of life , to understand firts the ideas , the concepts , it is the ideas that shows up first in our brain , that make us think , is those thougths that motivated us to find the facts , i think the facts should follow a good understanding of the ideas , finally if a student is in a class with out undestend ideas , is better to ask questions , express themself about how they fell , and have some help with books , webs , or talking with the tacher , it is better understand than learn facts , once i understand , the rest is easy .
