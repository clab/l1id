An education system should be capable of giving to the students all the elements in order to be a better persons and professionals .
Obviusly , understanding ideas and concepts is very important for the students for learnig and analize things , but I think that is not enough .

Students should have all the elements in order to resolve problems and face conflicts in the future .
Learning specifics facts , like history facts or gramar facts , is important , but is not the only way to get a complete education .
The specific facts , students learn them for the exam and forget next day , but if the teachers teach them how to connect ideas , how to understand concepts , how to make a connection between this with that , students will have the elements to be a sucesfull people .

An student can know everything about history or maths or maybe chemistry , buy if he ca n't make a logical conexion between facts and ideas , it does n't make any sense .
When students have to face on working expirience , they wo n't need specifical facts that they learn in school , they will need the capacity of conecting ideas and understanding concepts .
The last sentence does n't mean that facts , as dates or formulas or specifics things , students does n't need them in working life , probably will probably wo n't , but I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable for a company when they want a good employer .

Students needs an education that provides them a lot of elements to resolve problems , create ideas , connect concepts and anything can help them to be a person who can face any problem or situation succesfully .
