`` It is all about the club , makes your shot have a lifetime expirience '' ( wilson golf clubs ) this was an advertisment for a golf club about five years ago .
Why do I mention it ?
well I bought their product .
In the modern world that we live in advertisment and marketing are everything inside a free market .
Adverstisment is an important factor used by producers to sell their products , it makes the consumer become interested in the product and makes him most of the times buy it .

Bringing my previose quote again what I tried to show with it is that by just listening to a propaganda and its advertisment I became so interested in that club that I finally bought it .
I was young and just becoming a part of a famouse hobby called golf .
I wasnt aware of what brands were the best and so .
So I just bought the one that called the most my attention `` Wilson golf clubs . ''
It had a great advertisnment wich assured me that its product will last foreever and that it will make my game improve as a whole .
One year later it boke leaving me with no more than a memory .
I asked myself why ?

Well in the business world companies want revenue for greater profits .
One way of gaining it is by the means of advertising .
If you have a firm that sells shoes who is just beign introduced to the market you imidiatly want money , through advertisment you can trick the consumer into buying youre shoes because they are top quality and they will never get old nor loose their power .
Through this mean of business you can expand in the market and the only one who could get hurt is youre client with your crapppy product .

The world is filled with advertisment cartels and so .
We people need to be aware that what we are buying has a good quality because most of the times things arent why they seem nor said to be .
