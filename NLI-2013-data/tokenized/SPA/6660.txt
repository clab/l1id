It 's very difficult to know how many cars there will be in twenty years , because there are some reasons that tell us that there will be more cars , but also there are reasons in the opposite way .

I think it is more common and more easier to expect more cars in the future , because if you look for the number of cars twenty years ago you will be able to see that there were fewer cars than today , If this tend continues , there will be a lot of cars on our streets .
The problem is that tend cannot continue forever because we have not resorts enough to create and keep them alive .
And also we have no space for that cars .
For example , I have a car but I 'm thinking of selling it because it 's impossible for me find a place where put it .

Another reasons to expect an increase of the number of cars in the next twenty years , is the decrease of the prize of a car .
Nowadays everybody or almost everybody is able to buy a car .
But this is not completly truth because this part of the world is richer each day but the other part of the world is very poor and they do n't buy and produce any car .

Another reason is the tend of this world .
I think that comunication is now the more important thing .
You always have to travel because of your work or to visit people in other parts of the world , and you need something to transport yourself .
This fact multiplies cars ' sails .
But this reason also have the opposite effect , because now trips are so much longer than last years and you do n't do anything with a car , you need take airplanes or trains , but not cars .

In conclusion , on the one hand people need cars and there will be a lot of cars on the street , but on the other hand future will require other ways of transport .
Future requires public transport , and we should promove it .
So in my opinion , there will be fewer cars in twenty years but there will be a lot of cars yet .
