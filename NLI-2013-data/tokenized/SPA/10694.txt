Nowadays , people are trying to succeed in life in various ways .
They do this by learning new things , adquiring advanced technology , reading , updating themselves with whats going on in the world , and coming up with strategically ideas in which they can use these not only in the business , but personally .

I agree with this statement because if people did n't take any risks we would still be far behind technology , knowledge , etc .
The problem is , many people do n't like to take risks because they do n't want to lose time in trying out new things , they usually stick to what they 're good at , at that point .
Another problem is that many of us are afraid to fail and just do n't want to regret the time we spent , money , our sacrifice .
Most people just sit around and live up to other people expectations .

In the other hand , I understand the fear people have in taking risks because at the end , it all comes down to one question : is it going to be worth it ?
Well , you may not have an answer right away but as i said , if we do n't take risks at any chance , we will just be sitting around , waiting , and doing the same thing over and over again .

Going back through history , if mechanical people , engineers , architects , would n't have taken risks in manufacturing some kind of transportation for the world , we would probably still be walikng through one place to another .
The great discoveries that have occured took place because of the people who took a risk back then and we are what we are because of those people .
For example , microscope , telefone , medicine , transportation , internet .

In conclusion , we should all take risks at some point of our lives .
We could make dramatic changes in life by helping ourselves , others and the world by contributing and passing on our knowledge and courage .
