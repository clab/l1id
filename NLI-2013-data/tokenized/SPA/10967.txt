In order to be a successful person many people have acomplished it by trying new ideas and taking risks .
Doing what you you already know to do will not take no anywhere if it is what most of the people do .

Many of the best inventions on the world were the outcome of risks taken by common people , just like you and me .
We should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects .
A short example to help me prove my point is the following : There is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again , his life dosent change .
He is good at what he does but just like him , many others are good as him .
If this man would try out new things of change some of the things he does in his normal rutine and find a way to be more efficiently , he could change his life .
He is the only person who can actually do this .

Taking risks is good to do once in a while .
Business men are known to be risk takers .
In a business , many decision have to be made .
Once simple decision can make a difference on the final outcome .
Some times you might have taken a risk that you didnt want , but it happens to be a sucess .
We should also learn from our mistakes in order to not make them again .
Also everyday we make simple decision with out even realizing it .
These decision can be things just like what you will wear that day or what you will eat .
For example , going to a restaurant and asking the waiter for a different plate of food which is not the one you normally would order .

Sometimes , your risk may not have been a success , but you may not loose anything .
As an old man once said , `` You loose 100 % of the shots you do not take . ''
