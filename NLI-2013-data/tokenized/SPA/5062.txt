Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
To sell a product , it has to have a good promotion , advertisements sells the product because while showing the promotion of the product , the y are showing the best product ever , when sometimes it 's just a big lie and somtimes it 's the thruth .

The main purpose of selling a product for the companys is to show another thing better than what you sell .
I do not agree with this ideas because they 're not showing what the product really is .
A good idea is toi show a good promotion and a great idea of showing the product , and this will make the people intereted .

An important part to do sell , first of all you have to know on which market you 're getting in .
It 's hard to get into the market you want sometimes , but having the type of market makes the promotion easier , because you can do the marketing regarding to that market .

There is a backgroung behind a product , and behing a company .
The product that is already at sale has an enormous study before getting to the store .
Giving life to a product means you have to get the people to know the product by the time passes througth , by giving good promotions and by showing to the people what your product is about .

The best way to sell could be by improving your product just with very tiny changes like to make the product wantable , but not changing the product , just making people interested , curious and this will make people buy the product , this is a great way of doing a sell .

Advertisments are very good until a certain point , poeple without any promotion or advertisemnet people would't buy anything .
