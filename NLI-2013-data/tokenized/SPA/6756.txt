Nowadays , the quantity of cars is increasing very fast , but cars need petroleum and this resource is decreasing fast too .
For these reasons , we should ask ourselves if it will be possible to continue using cars in the future .

In my opinion , in twenty years there will be more cars than today , but the important difference will be that those cars will be more ecologic or they will use another resources than petroleum .

Firstly , it is not sostinable to keep the actual consume of petroleum for many years , so there will be a moment when we will have to find another energy sources for cars .
At the same time , new technologies are improving theirselves everyday , so in few years it will be possible to find a good alternative for petroleum and to invent new machines much more ecologic .
This means that the fact that petroleum will finish does not mean that cars will finish .

Futhermore , everyday cars are more necessary for people .
That is because , in modern societies , people need to move much more than before .
For example , many times some families have their home far away from their jobs or the education centers , so they need to drive a car to go to the workplace , to bring the kids to the school or to go shopping .

Finally , we have to know that many undeveloped countries , where now there are not many cars , are developing their economies and in the next years they will demand more cars for their population .

For these reasons , I think that in future , the quantity of cars will continue increasing , although , with the new technologies , cars will be ecologic .
