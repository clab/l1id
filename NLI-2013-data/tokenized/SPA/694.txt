Some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject .
As for me , I would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only .

Though there are a variety of subjects in a university for you to follow with .
But a single man 's energy and time are so limited that you ca n't afford wasting too much time on subjects that has nothing to do with your future career .
Imagine a freshman majoring Physics with a Selection Of English Literature in hand all day around , will he succeed in his field someday ?
Hardly .

Furthermore , we call these `` academic subjects '' because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school .
They are far more complex and complicated .
You ca n't expect to manage it within a semester or two .
It needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level of certain field .
Some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because an affection on the spur of the moment , as soon as he realizes that he wo n't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever , he will just simply drop halfway .

Finally , having a determination in specializing a single subject is a crucial step on your way of self-realization .
Anybody who wants to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise .
Michael Jordan may be a good example .
As soon as he decided to become a professional basketball player , he devoted all himself to the basketball court , without thinking other alternatives .
He set his goal and went for it !

In conclusion , Specializing in a single subject rather than pursuing many academic subjects will be a wise choice .
Focusing your energy and time into the subject , accumulating knowledge from that field and set your future goal firmly without doubt , it will lead you to the road of glory !
