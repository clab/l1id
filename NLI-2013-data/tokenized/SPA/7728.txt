I disagree with the statement for many reasons but I must agree with the fact that a tour guide can provide useful information about certain places that you can visit and that you may not know about .
I , being a very curious person , prefer to be left on my own to explore a certain place and learn about it by myself or at least accompanied by a friend or a family member .

By exploring a tourist atraction by yourself such as an ancient palace or castle , for example , you could wind up discovering several curious nooks or rooms not offered in a normal touring schedule .
If I 'm exploring a castle without the guidance of a tour guide , I might want to carry some sort of map or written information about the place so I can not only satiate my curiosity but also learn interesting facts in the process .

A teacher of mine once told me an experience she had when she visited some turkish palace some time ago .
She did not enjoy following the crowd of tourists around so she lagged behind of the tour group .
As they found themselves in some room , she struck up a conversation with one of the gaurds .
The gaurd liked her and told her that he could show her one of the rooms the `` regulars '' did n't have any access to .
The gaurd took my teacher through a door into one of the most gorgeous gold-laminated , ruby-studded room she had ever seen .

Tour guides can often be boring an monotonous and herd people along through different places as if they were a flock of sheep .
They will give the usual tour to the usual type tourists , one after another , after another , after another .
There is no dynamism involved in a guided tour , no interaction between the people , the guide and the location .
It 's the same routine for the tour guide : look here , take a picture there , here X person died , room after room .

By exploring a place on your own with a propper , written , guide you can learn a lot more and also enjoy some degree of independence .
If I ever visit the chateaus of France or the pagodas in Japan , I would largely prefer to be left on my own to inspect and explore every hidden room , corner and passageway .
