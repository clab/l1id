I think that in a certain way you can learn more from places if you go with a tour guide but probably will not be much funnier than going with your friends .

Also if you go with a tour guide you need to wake up at an specific time and be at that moment in the place he told you or if not you will missed that trip .
I think that if i want to travel to a place i will need to analyze for what purpose i want to go .
If I want to go only for pleasure or if i really want to know the turistic places and their history .

Probably I will decide to travel with friends but i will go to the tourism offices to get information about the touristic places of the city and select which places we like the most and visit them .
If the place will require a tour guide we will pay for it if not we will only enjoy the place and the moment .

Sometimes going with a tour guide makes you feel bore because you cannot go to eat or sleep at the time you want because you need to finish the program he have .

But for example if I go to a city for few hours or only for a day i will choose to go with a group led by a tour guide because probably if i go by myself i will not have enough time to visit many places and know the city .

In other words i can say that if you want to stay for many days in a place you can go visit places that seems interesting for you and later pay for the attention of a tour guide to talk you about the history of the city .
