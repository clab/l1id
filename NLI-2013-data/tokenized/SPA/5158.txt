Unfortunately , the experience of buying a product and not getting what we had expected is common to everybody .
However , it is not a frequently occuring experience .
We live in a society that is completely consumer driven .
People buy countless products in their everyday lives and are perfectly happy with what they have bought and this is the reason why they keep buying .
If consumers truly believed that they were being tricked by deceptive advertising they would simply not buy the product anymore .
Taking into account that consumers are the driving force in the economy this would undoubtedly send any company with such deceptive practices into bankruptcy .

Nowadays , it is no longer tolerable for a company to decieve their customers through advertisements that make their products look better than they actually are .
In fact , important organizations have been established in order to protect consumers from such deceptions .
The company involved in such activities would have to face large fines as well as the very negative publicity that such a scandal would cause .

Another reason why it is infeasible for a company to make use of such advertisements is because of the competitiveness of the world market .
Monopolies are no longer the norm as in the early 20th century .
Companies must constantly be seeking for ways to offer the customer a better product because they know that if they do not keep up with the market it will most definitely not wait for it to catch up .
Deceptive markiting is not a good choice for any company .
