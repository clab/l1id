i am relly agree some times i dont like a person that is teling you what you need to do or what you have to do but some times ir really interesting that they take you to the inportant places because if you go alone you have to be asking questionst to evry body so they cant telkl you the good places to go or the place that you should have to go .

One time when i lgo wit my dad the first time that y went to see tne sea it was very interesting but i dident know alot of thinks because i was to little so i was asking questions every time that want happend that if you dont know something you will ask but is diferent if you go whit seme one that he know the places that you are going and the informations ant the thimks that you have to take during the certain timew thsat you are going to be in the travel is a very importantb tink to go whit some that he already know abaut the situations he is goint to tell you lest go to this place because is more interesting ore you cand do more fun thinks that anly be in a room in a hotel or driving aroud town thats why i like to have somene that help me too know betere and more interestin place one time i went to california i was very exciting my aunt leave there but i was taveling by my self and i dident know i was really doing becouse i didet know many thinks of the place and allt he good stuff that you cand do in california that was a very interesting place i was visited all the most important places with my ant aunt and my cousins so it was a good time but i wil prefer to have a guide that cant tell me what i really have to do
