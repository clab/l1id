I do not agree with the statement , mainly for three reasons .
The fist one is that old people have lived much more than younger people have and thus they have more experience in life , the second one is that the are more mature and for this reason they do not have extreme attitude changes as youngsters do and the last one is that old people have more money to spend since they are working .

With the experience that old people have in their lives , I mean that they have experienced many feelings and have been in many situations that young people have not , and then , they can take the maximum of each day , the enjoy any moment because they know that certain situations will never be repeated , they use to see the future and prepare for it while young people just want to live day by day , not worring about the future .

My second reason is that older people are more matture and thus they do not have that radical changes in attitude that young people have .
Enjoying of this stability provides old people with a great advantage that can be used to dedicate the exact ammount of time to each activity , not wasting time like youngsters do .
Also , this characteristic is important in order to keep risks away by making the correct decisions and to avoid doing stupid things .

Finally and not less important is the factor of the money .
I would like to mention the importance of having financial stability in order to enjoy the life doing what we like .
An old person has the opportunity to wok hard and save money to take some vacations or tavel around the world while a young person rarely has this opportunity because they are studiyng and it is hard for them to work and study at the same time .
Because of this reason , older people can really enjoy life by doing great activities that will enrich their person .

As a conclusion , I would like to say that old people enjoy more the life than younger people do .
The reasons I have presented are just three but there are many other that can confirm that a mature person can enjoy a lot the life while the young people can be just living an illusory hapiness .
