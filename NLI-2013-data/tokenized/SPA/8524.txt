Trowgh the history of knowledge , there have been many ideas and trends about the best way to get and approach it .
May be the most common ones that are still present in our academic lives , and command most of the present teaching models we can find at schools and university .

The firs of them and may be the older one , inducts the knowledge , that mens some one have that knowledge and give it to others , that person is the master , the autority and almost superior , and their alumns follow him .

In to the other hand , we can find a more modern concept that promote the constructions of knowledge , that means each person can approach the knowledge in their own way , can get the ideas and concepts and constructs whith them .
In that case there are facilitators who gives that concept and the tools that students need .

That we can usually find this days in schools and even at university is a combination of both so depending on what is strongly enphasised we will get different result .

Personally , I studied in a Waldorf school that emphasis the construction approach to knowledge and later I had to go into a traditional school , that emphasis in induction of knowledge .
Now I am sure I had an advantage over the other students in the traditional school because I primarly lern how to get and understand ideas and concepts and construct knowledge .

If you just learn fact , with time you shurely forget them .
If you clearly understand concepst you will be able to construct again knowledge .
