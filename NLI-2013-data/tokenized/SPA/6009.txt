There are many reasons that make me think that the number of cars would be reduce in twenty years , for example the improvement in the public transport , the increase of the comunications like telephone and internet that could reduce the utility of a car because we could work from home , the increase in the contamination and therefore the policies of the goverments , and also the increase of the prices of Petrol and Gas .
But I do not think that there will be fewer cars than today .

During the last fifteen years we have seen a big improvement in public transports but it has not reduced the number of cars , as everybody can see there is more traffic , more cars per house , so the experience says that better public transport does not mean less cars , at least until now .

Obviously the price of the Petrol and Gas will be a problem , but since many years ago there has been research for new kinds of sources .
Now we have not discovered any better source than Petrol , but is more than possible that we can find solutions in electricity and nuclear fields than can satisfied our needs , and with a good price .

Other reasons that make me think that the number of cars will not decrease but increase is our style of life .
In a rich country like Ireland we can see how is important the appearence , and in this country where the roads are not good , you can see big and expensive cars and people do not need them , Why they have it ?
Only because when you have a big car , people respect you more because you look more important .

Another reason is the independence that I have with a car .
I can go wherever I want for my own , and this point is very important for me and I think that for everybody , and is something that the public transport can not give us .
