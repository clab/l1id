New advertisment is focused on appearance and not on quality

I believe that most advertisement is focused on create a cool image about a certain products .
Therefore , all these products are useless and will not satisfy consumers preferences .

First , companies are more interested to waste money on advertisement rather than on research and development ( R & D ) .
Consumers will prefer to have a more functional item rather than an item that is useless and expensive .
For example , few weeks ago I bought an Ipod and I was not sure to buy it because Mac has invested a huge amount of money and I heard some complaint about Ipod 's functionality .
Anyway , I bought an Ipod on Friday and just after two days from this day I accidentally drop it and my Ipod became useless .

Second , advertisement is always deep empty and it is aimed to show off a certain product .
Most of the people get surprised by a nice looking item and its advertisement , but I do not .
I take into account as a consumer the focus group that a certain item is aimed to .
And if I do not feel close to the idea of the advertisement , I will not consider to buy it .

Third , advertisement is aimed to hide qualities characteristics in order to cheat consumers .
I believe that a good quality product does not need any advertisement .
As an example , my oldest brother has bought a Bang & Olufsen Stereo and I have not heard of that brand of stereos before .
I did some research by internet about this brand and I got surprised because it is known that Bang & Olufsen is the best world wide brand for stereos .
Once again , advertisement always told me that Sony was the best brand world wide , but it is not if a consumer is looking for quality .

In conclusion , advertisement maybe guarantees a cooler product by its general consent , but not an effective one .
Advertisement is for not intelligent people and it always try to hide deficiencies on products .
