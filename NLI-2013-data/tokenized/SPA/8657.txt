I agree wth this statement .
The experience of the most of the schools are that students firstable understand ideas and concepts before learn facts .
Some reasons are :

In the first step , students should know the ideas and concepts of the things , because this method applied in our life .
When we were child , our parents tought us in a first way the ideas of the things and then the facts .
After that , we learned the facts , basicly , because our parents wanted to show us the thing that we proyected in our mind .
This system was implied in generations for our parents and the schools follow the same method .

Other thing , it 's that the idea or concept show us what we are talking about .
We create an imagination of the thing in our mind .
We clearly know what we are talking and what we are studying and that allows us to make a preliminary image before to know the facts .
After that , the facts can be easyly .
This make a better compretation of the definition .

In adition , facts in the school can be use like experiments or practices , so it 's helps to the student to undestand in a better way the idea o the concept .
Facts reflect the preliminary idea in the practice but we know them in our

However , both of them are important to give them to the students .
It 's necesary for the better compretation and the get better results in the students .
School should take more importance in the ideas and the concepts , then the students in the job or in the simply life can use it .
