In the world today , it is definetly much better to have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject without having the knowledge of the other subjects .
However , it should be a priority in life to have both .
As people learn about the various subjects , they can conclude which subject is to their most interest and that subject will be the one in which that person will specialize in the future .

For one , as a cultural purpose it is important to have the knowledge that the world offers .
If someone is a Doctor for example , and they do n't know about the world of politics , or about history , about writing , music , etc , than they will be considered ignorant .
It is essential to be able to flow in a conversation with different types of people .
In the case of a Doctor who is from the United Staes , if he/she is having a conversation with a Doctor from Bolivia , than it is important for him/her to know about the country 's history , political status , culture or issues .
If this Doctor meets with an artist , than he/she should know about the arts in order to flow in that conversation .

Another example could be a student .
If a student wants to be a journalist , that person must have the broad knowledge about all academic subjects in order to be able to write about each different topic .
Also in a college interview or in a job interview , you never know what they are going to ask you .
It is extremely important for a person to be highly aware about everything in the world .
Everything is connected .

Even for the future , when one has retired from their specialized job they will have for the rest of their lives , the knowledge and the experience of the many academic subjects that enrich the world .
When they say `` you only have one life , so live it '' , this quote applies to gaining this enrichment of the knowledge that a human being can aquire .
