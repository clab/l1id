`` Extreme Succesful People ''

The people who tries new things and take bigger risks than usual , are not always succesful and not always people that do not take risks are unsuccesful .

I think that the succes of one person do not depends from if the person is so intrepid or not .
This is , people can take many risk or try new things but they probably can not reach a bigger succes from whose they do not .

In my particular experience , I met people who does only one thing but they do it as well as possible .
And people who see this kind of dedication to work or whatever , recognizes the effort of person .
And this is a way to know if a person is succesful or not .

In the other side , person who tries something new can reach succes but if he or she is alway trying new things , never could do really good .
This is a person can do many many things and maybe people say `` Oh this man knows a llittle bite of everything '' , and this is right but i say : `` yes , he or she knows about everything , but he can not do a single thing in a perfect way '' .

Another reason i consider is , that people sometimes do things only to have a little of fun , and they do not dedicate time to improve things that they are doing or knowing even if they take the risk of do something totally new and that it appears the best thing they can do in their all life .

These rasons are why I think the succes of a person do not depends only if they take risk or not , the main reason for me to become a succesful people is `` Dedication '' , this single and simple words involves , in my opinion , they manner in which a man must be if he wants to be someone to whom people recognizes .
