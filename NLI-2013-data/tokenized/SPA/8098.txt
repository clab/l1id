Studying is a quite difficult and time-consuming task .
For this reason , it is very important for students to know where is more efficient to put all their energy .
One option is spend most of the time trying to memorize facts , such as numbers , formulas or dates .
Another aproach is trying to understend the concepts which actually explain those facts .

I agree with the idea that it is more relevant for studens to have a complete comprehention of the concepts than just memorazing facts .
Also , I think that an aproach of learning based on understanding concepts is more effective than an aprocah of learnig based on memorized fact .
There are two main reason which support my point of view .

First off all , learning concepts is more enjoylable than memorizing facts .
I remember when I was studing at the university and I used to hate all kinds of lists .
In that time , I had to take a lot of history courses and it was quite common for proffesors to give long lists of dates of different events .
Because of my studies , I have memorized a lot of lits and I can say that this is not fan at all .

Secondly , I think that when we understand concepts related with some field , we can also use this concepts to understand differents areas of knowlege .
This is the reason whay I bealive that understanding concepts is more effective than memorized facts .
For example , at the same time that we are understanding concepts related with the biology of the human body , we can also be understanding ideas that make us able to have a comprehention of the others mammal 's biology .

All in all , I can say that I am sure that conceps should be considered more relevant than facts by students .
Basically because there are more enjoylable to learn and represent a more effective way to get knowlege .
