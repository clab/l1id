In the first place I am the kind of person who likes to know about different themes and academic subjects , but I think that is better to concentrate in one specific subject because you are not going to be able to have a deep knowledge in many subjects .
I believe that is better to concentrate your knowledge .

Some people may think that is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
This idea could be true but I am sure that less is more .
For example if you are studying something realated with the arts like graphic design or filmmaking .
In thouse fields of study you have a wide varaiety of subjects to study and learn , but then you have to choose and concentrate in one subject or theme .
For example in filmmaking you can choose between different fields of study like Producction Design , Direction of photography , Editing , Screenwriting or Directing .
Even if you have a lot of subjects in common then you need to specialize in one subject .
For example if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about different themes and subjects like painting , art , literature , lighting .
But this does n't mean that you need to have a deep knowledge in all those things .
Those things are going to help you to understand about how things work but I believe that you do n't need to be able to handle the lighting for example .

Finally I think that life is to short to have broad knowledge in many things .
I prefer to concentrate in the things i enjoy and know about them
