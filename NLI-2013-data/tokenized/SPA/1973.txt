Is not about the age , is about the vision and the experience the reason because the young and older people do and think about different things .
When you are young , you think in study , work to get money for spent with friends , go to parties , do not obbey the older people , and do anything that you want .
The teenagers think about their friends , the clothes that use , the fashion , the TV , the games .
They are worried about live the moments , no matters the consecuences of their acts and the family is only the group of persons that wait for they at home , and give them money .

With the years and the experience , the vision of the life change , you think in get a real job which allows you to get all staff you need , you think to get a couple wich share the time and you initially , do not want childs .

When you become older you already have a family a home , and think so much the way to care about their .
You think and work for your children finish the school and go to the University , and you live only for your family .
They thinks about prevention .

Precisely because the older people enjoy their youth ( in most cases ) do not think in do the same things , they are looking for the better conditions for finish their lifes .

For me , is not that the young people enjoy life more than olders , is just that have another different point of view about life .
Only the experience that can get with every moment along their lifes can modify that shallow vision and transform it in a mature vision of the life and the world that allows to be a grown up person .

Just the time and the things you live , can change your vision of the life .
