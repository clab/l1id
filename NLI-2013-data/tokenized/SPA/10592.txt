Is is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
For example , a business person that has an expanding and growing company will probadly diversify his activities and explore new areas .

The background of this scenery is a feeling of confidence .
Once you can prove to yourself and to others , what you are capable of then appoval is no longer at stake .
You do n't have make a statement on your capacities and inteligence , you have already done that .
Now it is time for the next goal .

And in this line , ambition plays a very important part .
Human beings have a tendency to be unsatisfied .
Once you have reached an aim , another emerges .
As soon as you realise that you were able to do what you had set your mind and spirit to , the following project comes along .

This is a way of maintaining your self steem as high as possible .
Always looking for self realisation on the outside world .
However positive projects are in a person 's life , I believe that other things should be taken into account aswell .
For instance , being able to enjoy what you have produced .
If you are an important Congress man , it is my opinion that before running for President you make the most out of what you are living and feel proud of what you have already accomplished .

Moreover , there has to be a stop in the race for constant success .
Otherwise you might be spending most of your time analysing new projects rather than recognising your achievements .
If you were able to buy a beautiful house thanks to your dedication and hard work , my advice would be to enjoy it and share time with your family instead of working even harder to purchase a bigger one .

All in all , it is my personal opinion that there should be a balance between new aims and enjoying those already met .
In order to be successful you have to be able to feel happy with what you have .
