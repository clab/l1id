It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because , they can apply this concepts and ideas to resolve facts that may be presents in the future .
Also , this way would prevent dissapoinmemt and frustration in the student at the time that prepare them to resolve problems without experience , just knowledge .

If a student understand ideas and concepts , he would be able to resolve the facts succesfully ; thus , he has the tools to resolve problems and circustances without experience , just by using the knowlegde that he has learned before , in order to learn facts .
If the students learn facts before understand ideas and concepts , he would learn more painfull and they proprably would learn more by mistakes .
I really think is better learn by adviced that by expirience .

To Know the ideas and concepts first would prevent the student to make a lot of mistakes that can cost him pain and dissapoinments feelings , because he would propably choose the correct and convinient solution for the fact that present taking his knowledg .
Even though , this is not a warranty that the students would choose the correct solution .
He may choose the wrong one , but there is more propability that he choose the correct solution .

I really belive is more important for students to undertand ideas and concepts , that learn facts .
I would be more usefull , painless , motivateness and rewardeness to think in a solution taking the concept thar he has , that learn facts without experience and knowledge about it .
