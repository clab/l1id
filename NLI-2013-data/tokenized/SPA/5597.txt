There is only one way to make people buy something and that is to make them believe that there money is being spend wisely .
seals people know a millon reasons to convence people why they should buy there product .
Even if it includes streching the real use of the product to make it seem better then it really is , sealspeople are willing to make there advertisementes for there products seem much better than they really are .

The competition gets tougher and tougher as time goes by .
because there is more competition , that makes it more hard to make a product apealling for people to buy , that is when the advertising people have to come up with ideas to make people believe that what they offer , is a must have product .

Advertisements can also be disieving in a way were they look much better then they really are .
In the picture that they are being advertise , the size can be seen as being smaller or larger , depending in what the product is being used for .
For example , an i pot is going to be shown in a smaller size , but a house will be shown as if it was bigger then it really is .
Also the color of the product maight seem brighter or more colorful depending on what people are more likely to want and expect from the product being advertise .

Advertisements are advertismens and they are ment to sell products .
Even if they seem expectacular to people , they have to keep in mind that the real product will not be as expectacular as the advertisement .
Because if it was what would the popint of advertisments be ?
there would be no point .

The rasones that I explain above are some ideas of why advertisements make products seem better then they really are .
