Advertisements nowadays are as important to the firm that makes it as the final product they are sellin to us .
We can see advertisements everywere , in the street , on TV , newspapers ...
we do n't realise that we are being used by firms .
We do n't actually realise that we see this everywere but we do .
Firms try to get their make known so that we buy their product even if we do not need it .
People encharged on making advertisements try to create a need in people of the product his company sells .
For example : Spensive cloth makes , an expensive car , drinks ...
and so on .
Why do we need spensive clothes for example ?
We can also get dressed with old and cheap clothes but the company has alredy created this need in our mind so we think that the normal thing to do is to buy this product .

Advertisements are used in all aspects of our life .
Even on TV we can see advertisements of something that we do n't really understand but it still keeps up our atention .

This products seem to be great , unic .
Marketing companies make the product look absolutly perfect , that we need it to live .
We sometimes realise when we buy the product that it was not so good and we still keep on buying it !
A good example of this are champoo makes .
In their advertisements their product makes the woman or man 's hair look so shiny so we decide to buy it .
When we finally use the product we realise that our hair is not so brilliant as the woman or man in the advertisement .
This is because while doing the advertisemnt , there are many lights pointed at the character 's hair so it make his \ her hair look great and shiny .

Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
We have our own experience to know this is true .
