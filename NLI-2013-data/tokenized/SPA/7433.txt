For the past four years I have been the director of a group of misionary adolescents that helps impoverished communities in the Caribbean , and South/Central America .
As a part of the program , we developed a cultural dimension to it .
We have traveled all over the Americas , the Caribbean and Europe .
I have been the planner of the excursions , trips and tourism .
In the process , I have learned that the best way to travel is without a tourguide .

Usually the tourguides tend to plan and direct an excursion or trip based upon their own interests .
Therefore , you 're completely attached to the person 's caprices and circumstances .
Tourguides exist as consecuence of the capitalist society and are n't neccesary .
They are part of economic processes and do n't consecuently appeal to cultural knowledge and interraction .
For example , I once took a tour , led by a person who told us that he has been working for the company for almost twenty years `` [ this meant that he had a vast knowledge on the themes he was exposing ] '' .
When I asked him a question I already knew but wanted to confirn my hypothesis about the tour-guides , he exposed an irrelevant answer on the theme , and redirected the consersation .
On the other hand , the tour was programed to visit all the shopping malls and and places that seemed to have some kind of economic dimension .
The tour itself appealed the personal interests of the persons who organized it .

I have organized all the tours I have done in my life .
I jhave learned the best way to plan a trip is to do it yoursel .
