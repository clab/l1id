I do agree with the statement .
It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Having broad knowledge of many academical subjects offers the student to conceptualize a wider range of subjects and information from the world that surrounds them ; students that get broad knowledge , knows where to get whatever information they need under a given situation that might raise in their professional life .

Students gets during their academic studies , information about bibliography reference , knowing where to look for a broader set of issues than whose specialized for just one thing .

The brain can hold a limited quantity of information .
From every day 's life , we aquire huge quantities of it .
When specializing in one specifical subject , if we dont usually practice it in a daily basis , we might tend to forget about important things related to that specifical subject we 've been prepared for .
Although with broad education , students would tend to forget even more than with specialized education about all the different subjects , they get to conceptualize the most important basics of each .

Even if specializing into specifical subjects can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological means , substitute activities ) they then become obsolete for working in different areas .

We can also add another reason that is ; what if the professional becomes tired of working in the field he academically specialized ? ...
Would have to get academical studies again in a different professional area !

In example of this , if someone whose grade has been into the telecommunications field , and there one day gets tired of working in telecommunications , routers , switchs , commands ! , he or her becomes practically doomed to keep working in that they specialized for , for the rest of his or her days .

Instead , if the student chooses Computer Science , there is a much wider range of possibilities .
He 's able to develop systems in whatever area he wants to work for , including telecommunications !

From a social point of view , specializing into one specific subject might lead to isolation .
This can happen in ways that the person gets so specialized into something , that knows nothing about the rest of humanity ; gets not much to talk about , or even understand basic fundamentals of different areas .
