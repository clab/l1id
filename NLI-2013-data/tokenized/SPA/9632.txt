They are different kinds of people , some of them like to live their lives just the way they have and they are some other that love to continue improve their results , their goals , their lives .
One example of this kind of people are the successful people , who one day had a dream and they follow and make it real .

In this kind of people , some things can happend .
One thing is you will know you tasks and skills so well that you could became a costum or a rutine and you can stay stock in the job , the ideas or the the proyect you are working .
Also you can loose you profesional level because of that .

Another options is to try new things that breake the rutine or take risks that will improve your ideas day by day .
For example if I 'm use to take the second avenue to go to my job and always get late , to be more success in the time that I arrive to my job I can try a new road to get to it .
Another possibility is to evaluate periodical the process and traid different ways and then choose wich is the best .

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks , because they are not affair of change the things , change the process for an options that will be better and at the end will give them the chance to continue with the successfull that they have .
