The publicity news papers , televition and radio can use your mind .
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because they use our imagination to put a lot of things into and a round their products and are not true are your imagination , they play with your needers and what do you like to present a new product .

The litle companies can use less the advertisements for the handle products , they need other things to go to the custumers , for exaple they use the quality of each product for invite you to use the new product , they do n't use to make their product toxic sustances or similar things to invited the custumer to taste the new product and find better options for their health .

The big companies can use more the advertisements to their products because they have a lot of money in their publitician departaments , for example they use a especial event to put in circulation some new drink because they need a lot of people to taste the new flavour and put new sesation in their fashionable new product .

In conclusion , I think the advertisement put a lot of things in the new product , because they use the people mind their use the imagination , in especial what do you need listening about the new product , they use how the people want to listening or read or show and put a lot of qualities in their new product to invete you to taste the new product and if not true all the things they say .
