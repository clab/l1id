Life is a rollercoaster ride experience , which has its ups and downs , its high peaks and slow curves or falls , which means that each stage of this ride carries with it valuable experiences , each which we have to live at a specific time and period .
I believe both young and older people enjoy life equally the same , the only thing different is that they find themselves in different stages of their ride .
One in which there are franctic curves twist and turns , and the other in the calm and soothing final stage of their ride .

Older people have already experience what was like to be young and wild , to have fallen in love or have their heart 's been broken , while the young are those willing learners wanting to experience life at its fullest , simply because it is their time to wild , being allowed by their young bodies to do so .
Meanwhile older people have already experienced everything they could in their younger years for which they now have a time to reflect and realize that there is no hurry in life , that one as a youngster wish for everything to happen fast .
Which is why nature is wise in giving us that stage in life where we are able to reflect on our past mistakes and give us a final opportunity to mend them .
Therefore getting old is a way of saying that we have to mature , which wisely enough come hand in hand with our physical traits .

Both of these stages in life offer things which the other does n't , one wisdom which a life experience has taught you , and the other the inmense curiosity and uncertainty .
Therefore both of this stages in life have its charms , which appeal differently when being in a certain age .
Therefore while older people rejoice in the comforting feeling of having accomplished their goals , the young search for their own .

However the mere fact of beign old or young does not mean one can can or cannot have an active and wild spirit , being that some young people have what is popularly known as an old soul , being this a way to describe their mature attitute towards the world , whereas older people may still have this child like spirit .
A perfect example of this is my grandfather , who despite the fact of being 76 years old is a very active man , who still loves to play with his grandchildren and will continue to .

In conclsuion I do not belive that younger people enjoy life better than older people , it is simply that they are in two different stages in their life , which therefore means that they both have a different way of appreciating and embracing each and every life 's experience as it presents itself .
