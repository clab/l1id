Having a lot of knowledges could lead one to not know a lot about anything .
If this is true , many would not be able to specialize on anything due to the fact they do not know enough about a subject , to have a job or specialize in it .
Thus in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject , in order to suceed in and perfect the subject which one is studying .

A doctor , needs to focus on the medical aspect of its career in other to excel on it .
If a doctor were to study many subjects at the same time , he or she would get distracted from its main specialization which is saving lives or working in a hospital .
Ofcourse , the doctor should know a bit about english , grammar , and other subjects esential to live , but the doctor should not focus entirely on those subjects , because they are not as important as a biology class can be .

If someone specializes in one specific subject and gives all its attention to it , one will have greater possibilites of excelling and learning about the subject .
For example , in my school we use to have 13 courses per semester , and people did not have time to focus on any single subject as instensively as they should or wanted to , because it was too muh work .
After a while , the school changed its policy and decieded to cut down the courses to 5 , in which people could take math , science and spanish and other two courses of their choice .
Students started to pull up their grades because it was easier to focus on the subject one liked and specialize on the subject that was related to the career one wanted to pursue later on in life , for example people would take 2 classes of math , and were able to focus and specialize in math for the future of their bussiness career .

Although it is good to know about many subjects , in my opinion it is imposible to learn and really excell on them while one is studying many different subjects .
In that case students are learning the esential things about the subjects , but are not taking the time in any of them to specialize and pronfundize their knowledge in a certain subject .
If a doctor would broaden his or her knowledge , he or she would probably never look deep into medicine subjects , and would just have the broad or overview of it .
Making this a disadvantage for them and us patients .
Also if my school would not have lowered the number of courses , students would have never been able to really specialize in a subject , but would have simply seen the overview of it , never fully understanding each and every one of those subjects .
Therefore in my opinion it is better to know a lot about something , than to know a little about everything .
