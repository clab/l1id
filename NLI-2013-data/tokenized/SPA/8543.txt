In my opinion , I agree with this statement because I believe that understanding the whole context of an specific topic , in other words , capturing the ideas and concepts , would allow a student to develop a better meaning of what he is learning which could be reinforce with the different facts described during the course .

For example , when I was a attending classes at university , I always tried to pay more attention to the main ideas the professor was trying to explain , which does not mean that I found facts less important , but in my case , I knew that in order to understand and facilitate my studying for an exam , it would better if I could develop the topic thinking in a different way and not just memorizing each word he said or each fact stated .
Nevertheless , facts would help me have more specific details about the class but if I have just learned facts or be more interested in them than in concepts probably I would forget those facts faster and may have more problems in answering questions that were not asked during the class because I did not understand what the main idea was about or what the professor was trying to teach us .

Another important example why I am convinced ideas and concepts worth more than facts is related with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is being developed .
For instance , most students have a knowledge on how a country 's economy works or why it is important to have accountants in a company without needing to study Economics or Finance just by understanding the concept of free markets and how important finance are for companies to succeed .

Students are going to have a better knowledge of what they are learning if teachers put mpre emphasis on the ideas and concepts rather than facts .
