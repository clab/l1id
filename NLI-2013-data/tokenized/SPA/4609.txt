What 's the goal of advertising ?
Selling , is n't it ?
Every punch-line , every jingle , every smiling girl or playful baby is used to sell us a product as a mean for obtaining satisfaction and , eventually , happiness .
Of course advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
But is it enhancing its qualities they only thing they do ?
Or do they work our minds in a much more complex and wicked way ?
We should n't ask ourselves if advertisments are the result of lies , because the answer is quite evident .
We should ask ourselves how they affect us and how to deal with them .

What publicity tries to do is not making us believe that their product is the best in the market , we can verify their promises by going to a local store .
What they really try to do is to sell us values and life-styles along with the product .
Venezuelan beer comercials are the best example I can think of .
Their target is young people , so they take activities young people tipically do , like going to to beach or partying .
Then , they create a clever and delicate web of images , phrases and situations that work our minds into believing that consuming that beer will make us cooler , funnier and more outgoing .
Drinking beer makes us into everything we 've always dreamed .
The sexy lady who drives boys crazy , or the stud that hooks up with ten girls on a single night .
Beer equals fun , like in a mathematical equation .

Of course , this process does n't occur at a conscient level , it 's way more subtle .
At the beginning we may not feel particularly atracted by the product , but after some parties where the situations showed in the ads repeat themselves contantly - Marketing geniuses make sure that they do - we are unwillingly drawn to it .
We start drinking , we feel confident and then we become consumers .
Advertisements have achived their goal .

The beer story is only a small fragment of the world of comercialization in the modern world .
There are ways of persuading people to consume that we ca n't even imagine .
So , what should we do ?
Should we leave the cities and assume an amish way of living ?
Should we deny civilization and return to a Roussaunian state of nature ?
I do n't think the answer must be that radical .
It all lies in our capacity of being critical , of seeing the thin threads intended to manipulate us and deciding whether to accept them or not .
Luckily , we are provided of freedom and capacity of choice , therefore we 're not determined by the influence of publicity , no matter how hard marketing geniuses try .
We must ask ourselves if we want to be comercial puppets or if we want to decide our visions of life and our social behaviour .
Both choices have their advantages and disadvantages , its up to us to decide who we want to be : The stud in the club or the outsider glaring full of contempt .
