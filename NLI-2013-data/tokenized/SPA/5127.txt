In our world , everything can be sell , from a coke , a chair and alcoholic drinks , to security services , hair brushers and even medicines .
Television , radio and internet are ways of advertising a product .
I agree with the fact that the majority of these advertisements make things seem so much better than they truly are and there are many reasons to think that .

First , in an advertisement that is presented on television , the product that is being promoted appears like if it is the best thing in the world , and most of the times , it is not .
For example , when a company is trying to sell a soda , a coke , it presents a cold coke with some ice on it and a woman , because a woman sells better than a man , drinking it with passion , and at the moment that she feel the flavor , there is an explotion of excitement and refreshment , making you think that you need to buy one of those because it seems amazing .
After you bought one , you get frustrated because it was not what they told you it will be .

Second , if something that is for sale is really the best thing in the world , the people that sell it would not have to promote it very much , the people will buy it without anything that makes them do it .
For example , you never see a computer or an effective medicine that are being promoted by showing a half-naked girl .
On the contrary , they just tell you its characteristics , and sometimes they do not even show the computer to you .

Finally , it is good to conclude by saying that we all have to pay a lot of attention to things that are advertised on the means of communication , we have to do this because we might buy something that , at the beginnig , we did not even want it .
In addition , we have to be very careful and not let this people to wash our brains , instead , we should know what we really want and buy what we truly need .
