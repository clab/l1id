Is innovation exclusive for succesful people ?

Or so I would call my essay , as the way the exam question is phrased I could call two different answers :

Yes , successful people try new things indeed , since they have the chance - sometime this represents a budget to play with - to do so .
In our current world state in its ever-defining processes-for-everthing mania , the chance lies for certain individuals to look at things from a different angle .

The innovation chance comes naturally to mature individuals and mature companies , since those are the ones that understand ( through living ) that a mature process produces predictive results .
Given a experience-driven and refined process for making software it is possible for an Indian Consulting Company to predict how long will it take to develop a project , how much time the risks will take away from it and how much resources should it allocate to get the project going .
Its due to a mature set of processes that companies like Bimbo can do just-in-time deliveries to every convenience store in its city .

It is after embracing such level of maturity that an individual or a company can find room for improvement , room for trying different ways and expect different results .
And , as I would call that level of maturity a certain degree of success I agree to the proposed statement .

For my second answer however , I can answer `` No '' , for it is not an exclusive habit , as sometimes emerging little companies and individuals , virtually no-ones in the business world need a more agressive strategy .

For these companies and individuals that have perhaps spoted a new target market or developed a brand new product , there 's no time to be doing things the long-term way , sometimes fail-proof or tested .
Sometimes there is no room for mature processes where time is crucial , for these kind of individuals or companies , subject to these kind of conditions , is that I agree with the risk-taking deal , even when they know nothing of how to make something work and they have to start something from scratch .
