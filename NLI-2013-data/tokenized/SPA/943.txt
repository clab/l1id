We should all know a little about everything , other wise we would be ignorants .
It is true you ca n't learn about everything and sometimes should choose between what we want to learn , but more than anything I belive we should know many thing insted of closing our minds to what we only need .
My step father , actors and every human living in this world can be used as examples for this statement .

My step father profession is music he lives and breads music , but he knows about every thing !
Anythin you ask him he will be able to answer and this demostrates character , personality and good parenting .
Even though he doesent need calculus for his line of he has used his knoledge of calculus to help his daughter and I with our home works .
He shaires his knowledge with everyone and even though he doese n't need it , he passes it on to someone who does .

I aspire to be an actor when I go to college and being an actor is alot more than just acting and saying some lines , actors need to constantly be learning , every single piece of information they can get their hands on they learn it , they might never use it , but it is there just in case .
Who knows when he might land a role were he is Alexander the Great , good thing he read that history book when he was in college , he has to know about the character to characterize him .

And of course every other human in the world .
The reason i belive this world is so messed up is because we do n't take our time to learn , learn from the mistakes in the past so we do n't make them again .
Ignorance is the destroyer of this world we live in , not knowing , `` bah , I do n't need to know about architecture !
Well goverment ...
we just lost New Orleans '' for being ignorant to the world around us we will some day , kill the rain forest , kill the sea with all the oil diging and destroy the world with global warming .

We all need to know about `` stuff '' even though we ca n't know about everything , we ca n't turn the blind eyes to the things that are right there in front of you for you to learn about them .
If we can make ourselfs smarter , get smarter and let knowledge in to your brain .
