Ideas and concepts prepare the base of something that wants to be learnt .
Learing from facts means to experience something and so it means to have a deep knoledge .
Thus , from my point of view it is more important to learn from facts rather than to understand ideas and concepts .
If not , you do not really know what you have learnt .

In order to learn something , the understanding of the ideas and concepts is an important thing .
For instance , if you are learing about literature during a cert period of time , it is very important to understand the concepts that it ivolves such as the social context , the different author and the style of writing .
This create an important background of knoledge about the literature but you do not learn everything because you do not read the literature .

In contrast to the above , if the facts are learnt a better understanding can be obteined .
For example , instead of trying to undestand the ideas and concepts of this literature century , the option of reading the main books of this century should be taken .
If the books of the main writers are read , the students will be able to infer a great deal of things so that a better understanding is reached .
Most of the things that are learnt by isolated concepts and ideas can be drawn by a carefully reading of the most important authors .

Therefore , if you try to learn facts you get the concepts and ideas that you would need to understand something while with the other way around is not possible .
Thus , I think it is more important to learn from facts rather than ideas or concepts .
