In twenty years the number of cars will be even larger than the number of cars that we have nowadays .
There are many reasons to think this , the most obvious one is that technology wont be able to create a substitute for the car in only twenty years .
There are other reasons that are more human , like dependency .
In twenty years cars will not be as bad for the enviroment as they are today but the number of cars will increase noticeably .

In the last century technology has changed our way of living , one of the most important inventions was the car .
Who can imagine what would happen if suddenly all the cars in the world disappear ?
it woul be a caos , the level of dependency that we have on cars is very high , we need them .
Cities are built in a way that life without a car is like hell , almost impossible .
Distances are longer and roads are made for them .
But the main reason is on technology , cars are now starting to use electricity as their source power ( even tough they use gas too ) but this improvement does n't help to the problem of the number of cars .
Because there will be cars that do not use gasoline but they will still be cars .
The United States is the model for the world and cities there are really wide , cars are really needed , american families have a minimun of two cars .
So as the world gets `` americanized '' more cars will be used .

We also have to note the human incapacity to find an alternative .
There are alternatives but none of them is perfect .
We can use buses or trains but in order to use a train or bus you have to go to the station and it will not leave you at the exact point where you want to go .
Some people can say that riding a bike is the solution , but let 's be real , are people going to ride a bike when they can go five times faster using a car ?
without getting tired !!!
Bikes are the ideal solution but our human condition makes us lazy and consequently the bicicle option disapears .
Maybe in the future the cars will fly , that would solve a lot of problems , but it is not something that will happen in the near future .

In conclusion , we will have to wait more than twenty years to see the number of cars decrease , and a radical change on our society or technology has to happen in order to this to occur .
