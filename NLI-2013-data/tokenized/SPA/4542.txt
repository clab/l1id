I agree with the statement and general idea that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they are .
The reason for this lies in the reason for the existence of the advertisement itself .
Advertising is a tool used to lure consumer 's into buying a product .
Given the means and tactics used to lure consumers and to make products more appealing , I agree with this statement .

If a given product contains any minor flaw , this is never reflected in the advertising for it .
Consider the governments ratings for motor vehicles .
Not a single piece of advertising for motor vehicles would state things like `` rated most potentially hazardous vehicle in its class '' or `` lowest fuel efficiency . ''

In certain types of advertising , products may be accompanied by other things that make the product more desirable , but these things are not included with the product .
This is intended to mislead and confuse any potential consumer .
A perfect example of this can be found in nearly all advertising used to sell toys , specifically action figures .
Most kids are playing in very well crafted worlds with their action figures .
However , the kids do not percieve or do not realize that the action figure will probably not be as much fun to play with in his or her living room .
The consumer is mislead .
Any indication that only the action figures is the item at hand is relatively unnoticeable .

Blowing up and exagerating qualities and results is the most common method of making a product seem much better than it really is .
Infomercials make up most of this trend .
They promise things that happen in a small number of cases but which are not generally the case .
Weight loss pills and medications are advertised using results that are atypical and are intended to mislead consumers .

As we have seen with these three clear cut examples , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
They cover up or fail to mention any flaw with a given product ; they present products in a way in which they are much more appealing ; and the strongest evidence that supports this statement is exagerating it
