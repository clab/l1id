I agree .
Most of the students are always trying to learn about things that they even understand about , they just are repeating things with out a little notice about the topic because some thimes the only matter it 's to obtain a good grade , I understand that when you are trying to repeat and studing hard something just for accomplish a good grade it its more dificult to remembered in the furure , and it 's more dificult to practice it in a live time as an experience wath you had study just for a fact .

If we are talking about students I think that the main focuss should be not how hard they study because in that case this student will be measured by his memory skills and what for a student should be graded is by his aprendice experience that 's what make poeople competitive see how hard they learn by understanding , and the only way to get student into the leraning experience is by first teaching them to understand , so lets give them the importance in how to learn by a clear slide about the idea of comprence .

In other way to suport my thouth its by the importance of emphaty in all relations and this is the meaning of understanding the other part , so this understanding prosess it has positive impacts in all professional , academic , business and personal issues having a clear image of an effective understanding prosess and I think that in the order that you understand something in that order you 'll be succesful and in most of the times succses is the meaning of happines , so let 's promote the understanding between our students , let 's try to make them happy so they can give us back a good and ethical work that our society its demanding

This is just my personal point of view
