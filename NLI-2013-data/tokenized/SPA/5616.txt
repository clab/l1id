Would you eat a hamburguer if the image that is shown of it doesnt show a delicius meal ?
i dont think you will , i wont , and its true that i will probably be mad by the time i get the physical evidence of the advertisement image if it does not look like the picture .

I believe that those who work on advertisement must cheer customers to buy , buying is what makes marketing moves , because of buying is why economy works , it is their job , and it is our right to know how it works , so i dont think its a matter of agreeing or disagreeing about it , we can not believe everything we heard or everything we saw , we must know and be able to make our own statements of the things that media brings to us , for example i dont believe on what news are telling me , it is proved that there is always some edition of the true , like when a president of some country creates a virtual reality so he can excused his self to do a lot of barbarian acts , like war , killing , polluting , and other horribe things .

I lived at Bogota , and the police is making the people to believe that there are terrorists around , so we need the police to feel safe , i wont trade my freedom for security .

Coming back to the advertisement topic , i thing that is the own goberment who has the job of not letting people to feel cheated making several laws that punish those people that makes money selling a false image of the product .
we have to be aware of not buying untrusty products .

Finally i had to say that its peoples choice so have to be awake and ready to say if it
