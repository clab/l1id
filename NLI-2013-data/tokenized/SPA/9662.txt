Nowadays lots of people look for success but they do not take risks to achive it .
From my point of view , success is something that you have to look for and to work for but it is not something that comes to you without effort .
Thus , you have to take risks rather than keep your whole life only doing what you know as it decreases the possibilities to be succesful .

On the one hand , some people decide to dedicate their entire life to do what they already know how to do well but who knows if there is something that you could do better but you are not aware about it ?

For instance , if you are a very good dentist but you have always been working for someone else you will never know if your own bussiness would be more succesful than the one of the person whom you are working for .
On the one hand , you could be working your whole life for someone else and doing what you know how to do , dentistry in this case .
On the other hand , you could take the risk to open your own bussiness and even to create your own franchise .

Nevertheless , taking risks does not mean success because your bussiness can fail and you can loose money as well .
For example , if you decide to open your own practice you can find that you have not patients and of course , that you have no money .
But , you can realize that with the time your number of patients increases as well as your money and that your practice is being successful .
However , you can never know if a project is going to be succeed if you do not risk and try it .

Therefore , people can work in what they know how to do well and become succesful after have risked something , in this case money to invest .
Whereas , peolple that is working in what they know how to do but they do not take risk are less likely to succeed .
So , we should take risks in order to succeed and also to learn what we did wrong if we have been unsuccessful .
