In my opinion , I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .
I agree that it is important to learn facts , but if a student end only learning facts without understanding the ideas or concept this will be a mess .

Firstly , I agree completely with the statement because since I was a child I was educated : first to understand the idea and concept and after learning the fact .
However , although it is important to learn some key facts it is not as important as it is to learn the meaning or understand the idea .

Secondly , I also agree with the statement because it reminds me while I was studying medicine and a classmate of mine learned with his father how to make a `` heart operation '' but without even knowing the risks involved in the operation .
Imagine how dangerous could be for a person to be operated by a student who does n't understand what he is doing .
It would be better if he study , understand the concept/idea and after that he learn how to do it .

By contrast , it is also true that some persons starts learning the facts and after that they manage to understand the idea and the concept .
But this is not the common way , neither the best nor the ideal .

I also agree with the statement because it is prooved that this is the correct way how to proceed .
If they want to know and learn the facts they need first to understand the ideas and concepts .

To conclude , if I was a teacher and I am in front of the following statement or with the doubt of how to teach to my students , I would make them first to understand the ideas and concepts and afterwards to learn the facts .
