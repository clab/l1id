I disagree with this statement because there are a lot of way to travel .
You can travel alone or with a gruop , with a guide or without guide , all of these depend of the motivations of your trip .

I think the best way to travel will depend of the motivations of your trip .
Maybe if you want to expend so time quitely to relax yourself or maybe to meditate , you will prefer travel alone without guide .
The motivations in that kind of trip is only relax and have a good time .
Some people need these time , in this rush society where all the things pass very fast .
Some poeple need space to enjoy and have time to theirselves .
For these reason I believe if you decide have your time the best way to travel is alone .

But in other way is you want enjoy and take a trip for education reason you will choose go with a group and guide .
The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go .
In this ocasion I think the best way to travel is in group because in the group you can share ideas , information and you can learn in social enviroment .

Other example that ilustrate my point is this : supose two men decided make a trip for El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico ) .
The motivations of the first person is have a good time with friends and explore all the forest , but hte motivation of the second person is pass a good time reading in the high of the mountain .
The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , but the second person will agree that the best way to travel is been alone , without guide .
For me this example ilustrated my point .
This statement depend directly for the motivations or the intentions of the trip .
I could n't decided until I can figurate why I want make this trip .

Perhaps I decided that the decision depend of your motivations , most of the time I choose travel in group and in my experience a enjoy a lot when I travel in group .
For me is great go with my friends to other contries to explore .
This is my experience but in conclusion I agree with this statemen : `` The best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motivations '' .
