I do n't agree with the previous statements bacause , modern technology is advancing with huge steps .
I recently saw a report about a new aeroplane that in ten years will fly from Sidney to London in half an hour , well that 's amazing .
So if new discoveries are taking our world so far ...
cars might be able to do things we would never imagine .
Maybe in twenty years time we will be able to get in our cars and choose a destiny like ...
New York and fly in the comfort of being in your own car and with our family .
All of this might be quite exagerated , but cars wont stop being used , because its the easiest way of moving around , i even think that the use of cars will increase .

By that time cars wont contaminate , they will be electrical and they will be plug each night in gigantic electronic parking lots , that provide energy by solar panels .
Maybe cars will even move by wind enegy or they will have helixes ...
in a certain way we would be kind of returning to `` The Flinstones '' , ( where they moved in a car by sticking out their feet and running around ) , but in a modern way .
And if the problem is traffic ...
there would be two highways , one at the groung and one at the sky , like this everything would go much faster .

Anyway , all of this are major words , that probably wont happen , but that does n't mean that there will be fewer cars , that nowadays .
If there are so much cars right now all over the world , in twenty years that wo n't change bacause defenetly the world is getting faster , more stressed , and more complicated ...
and people wo n't get on a bus to go to work , when everythig is so rushed , people coming in , people goinm out ... , when they could have the facility of getting into their cars and driving to work with no stress and no rush .
The actual problem is parking ...
there 's no more space to park your car in big or small cities .
But for example Dubai and some other countries have allready introduced new robotic parking lots .
They are like a circular skyscraper where cars are parked by a robot .

So I finally have to say that in my opinion , cars wont decrease in our world , they will actually continue increasing and they will make our life much easier .
