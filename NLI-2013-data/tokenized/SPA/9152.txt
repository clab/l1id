Students who learn to understand the methology of a certain process have enough capacity to quickly identify and solve a problem , eventhough changes were done in the examples used to explain the new topic .
I agree with the fact that states that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is more relevant when a person solves a problem by understaning every step done , than by following all the process by memorization .

For example , a mechanical engineer student who is taking the course of Statics has a better probability of getting better grades if he understands all the main concepts of the class .
Teachers explain the theory in problems very different from the ones utilized on tests .
So , when a student only learns the facts about the stresses applied to an object with certain geometry , he will not be able to answer the problem if the teacher changes the geometry of the object on the test .
The student should be able to understand how to apply the related concepts in any given situation .

In my own experience , I can apply this statement to one of my hobbies , playing golf .
Two years ago when I started practicing this tricky but fun sport , I needed two take classes every week .
My teacher always remembered me about the importance of doing the movement , `` swing '' , thinking on it , not just doing it automatically .
This concept helped me a lot to understand my mistakes during the swing .
So , this left me the reflection about understanding every step of the movement and not just doing it mechanically .
After some time of playing golf , I learned that when you just learn the facts and do not analyze them , you start repeating the same errors without identifying them .

As a conclusion , this two examples showed the importance of understaning ideas and concepts over just learning the facts .
Understanding the concept give you the ability to easily recognize any error .
