I completely agree with this statement .
There is no point in knowing facts without capturing the essence of the ideas .
This applies to all fields of study .
As a civil engineering student in Mexico City I had to learn many formulas and techniques to solve many problems .
We would concentrate mainly on structural design , having to learn to apply these methods by heart .
There was not much sence in learning the formula because in the real world we are able to open a book .
The real important part came when we had to understand the effects and the causes that interact with the structure at study .
A good engineer is the one that really understands the structural behavior of what he is building .

The same applies to a history student .
There is no point in knowing all the exact dates of historical events if there is no understandig of the essence of the study .
What good would it do if the student does not have a feel on how a culture lived , what they ate or what they thought which lead to the historical event .
The dates will stay in almanacs forever but the real learning comes from understandig the ideas and the concepts .

Schools today tend to lean towards a more understanding way of teaching .
They focus mainly on atracting the student 's attention by taking them on field trips or by having more interactive materials to teach with .
Computers and the internet help to visualize and understand concepts that would have been difficult to explain without them .
There are also easier ways to obtain factual information now than before .
This makes it almost useless for a student to learn the facts .
They have to focus on understanding the ideas and be able to apply their knowledge in real life .
The only way to do so is by having the right education .
