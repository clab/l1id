I agree that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' because their main purpose is to sell people their product of service , and they would do whatever it takes to increase their profits .

A typical example of this marketing strategy would be the advertisements used in the food industry .
Some cans , boxes or bags show their products really big , juicy and seeming tasty .
However , when the costumer opens the product , he sees that the product is much smaller and most of the time is not even similar to the product they were showing in the package .

Some fast food restaurants also show tasty pictures of their products , usually hamburguers , hot dogs , or sandwiches .
These meals seem to be much bigger than they really are , with fresh vegetables and soft bread .
But when the costumer actuallly recieves the meal , it turns out to be a small common burger .

No only the food industry uses those tricks .
A major industry that not only highlights the product itself , but the benefits it offers to the final user , is the beauty industry .
This industry includes make ups , magic pills , gel or creams and all sort of products that promess to make someone beautiful , skinnier of younger .
When trying to sell their newest product .
It is typical to see the `` before and after '' ads , showing a fat lady and then after taking the pills , or applying the gel or cream , she looks much better , skinny and healthy .

A variety of examples could be provided of how marketing people maximize the products ' capacities .
But the thing is that they actually do it and it is not properly regulated .
This is not only unethical for the costumer who buys the product , but for the potential costumer who is thinking about purchasing it .

In my opinion , the solution for this problem is legal regulation .
I think that all products ' ads that show better products than they actually are , should be taken away from the stores .
Besides , if any client complains about a product that did not met his or her expecations based on the product advertisement , should get their money back .

If a proper solution is not implemented , more people will be affected and finally , the company will loose actual and potential costumers , since no one wants to be mocked again .
And a costumer that is lost , is lost forever .
