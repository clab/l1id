`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know hoe to do well '' .
This statment is often said about people and what they should do in order to be successful .
Succes is measured by what you have accomplished .
In life if you take risks your are going to be more successful because your are going to get better at what you do , improve in some areas and learn .

First , if you take risks you are going to get better at what you do because you are going to have more practice .
Having more practice you can see what you are better at and what things you should improve .
One day my friend was really scared about making a decision because what if she failed .
The first times she tried she was right , she failed .
But with practice the teacher is born .
She became so good at what she did that she was more successful .

Second , you are going to improve your qualities .
Like my friend , she realized what areas she could change and improve them in order to be better .
If you dont take a risk you are always going to be good , and thats all .
You want to be great at everything and sometimes we just need a little push and courage to know that at first maybe its not going to be better , but at the end of the road you are improving in every single way .

Third , by taking risks and chances you are learning .
Learning is the most important quality .
If you learn from your mistakes and from the things you are good at , you can combine the knowledge and create something wonderful .

People are successful because of what they do , the things they create and what they are good for .
Every person during their lifetime has to take a chance , risk what they have .
If they dont they are never going to be great , just good at what they are .
But if they do decide to take a risk they are going to learn so much more that even if they fail they gain more knowledge than a person who didnt take a risk .
This is why successful people take risks , to gain to knowledge of different things , and to be great at what they do .
