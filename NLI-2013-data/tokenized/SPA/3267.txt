Young people nowadays definitely do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is clearly reflected in modern society where everyone is busy taking care of his/her own problems and very few people have the kindness of caring a little bit more about the people around them .

There are two kinds of young people that should be considered .
On the one hand , there are those who do not care about the community where they live in , they are so busy doing their things , enjoying themselves or getting into trouble that there is no way they would have time to think about their community .
These people live their lives centered on themselves and are most commonly seen among us .
They do not want to do it because they would rather use their time and money doing things that would benefit themselves , which is probably the most obvious thing to do .
This selfishness is one of the main components of the human being that is almost impossible to eliminate .
Even if they had enough time or money , they would surely find something to spend it on and not dedicate it to helping the community .

On the other hand , there are those who really wish to help the community .
They are rare , but not extinct .
They are usually those who have a little more spare time to dedicate to things other than themselves and probably the economic power to do it .
Spending more time and resources on the community would mean having less left for themselves , something that not many people can really afford because these young people usually have to study , go to school , or even work !

I personally believe it all resides inside of us , in the desire to do it or not .
Even when under bad circumstances , as long as you have the will , there is nothing that can stop you .
But if the will is not present , no matter how much time or resources you have , you will always need it for something else .
