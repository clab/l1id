There is an opposse attitude towards life .
Young people want to enjoy life , be happy , try new things , and some old people want to survive and do not take risks .

The activity , the strenght and the happiness of young people are the proof of their enjoyment of the life , and in my opinion , these characteristics can belong to an attitude more than an age .
