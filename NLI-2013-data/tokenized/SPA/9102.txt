The world toll us through the history that is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts , but more important is to learn facts ...
Sometimes people think because they understand ideas and concepts they will reach the fame .
In the college you can see a lot of students that always get the higher grades - understanding the ideas and concepts - but at the moment when they graduate and have to find a job they do n't reach the fame .
These peoples do n't makes companies , because they follow the ideas of make only some money and start to work to people like Bill Gates , Donald Trump or Google 's Companies , people who make himself big because learn to facts .

When we were kids , our parents a lot of time toll us what things we should n't do , and we can have clearly the concept and the idea - like we should n't touch the fire because is hot - but when you really learn this things is when you learn to fact , like when you feel the fire or when you see a house on fire .

In the history there are a lot of interesting case that toll us that is more important to learn facts that to understand ideas .
One of this , is the case of a men called Albert Einstein .
This person was n't really good in school , he always got bad grades , but in his house , he was learning to facts , doing things by himself .
After years of learn to facts , Albert got a conclusion of an important theory , and one day Einstein won the Nobel 's award .

In conclusion , you have to understand ideas and concepts , because this is going to be important for your life , but more important is learn to facts , is that you go out and see all the world and try everything , and this will be very good for you .
