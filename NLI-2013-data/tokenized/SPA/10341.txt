I believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their lifes , however some people could argue that a successful life stands on what you think is being success for you .

It probably depens on the way you have been educated .
Some people find their success in doing what they are doing good .
Others are always trying to go a step forward .
The unexplored part of going a step forward has a strong risk that people has to take only if they want to .
And this is what I believe make us being different or at least , not being as everyone elses .
Successful is related with being strange , in a unique way , to stand out of the rest of the people .

However , I think it is totally related to you own culture .
Being successful in the United States is not the same of being successful in China or a small town in Africa .
My personal experience travelling aroung the world has given me a different idea of what is means to be successful in life .

Usually , I relate the success with my own culture and place it in what we call the first world , which means being successful in bussiness enviroment or economy talking .
However I think it is neccessary to take a step back and think of other cultures : being successful could mean be the leader of a small town in India were it is related to the one how was able to do something ( for example bring water to a village from a long_distance river or to be able to kill a lyon in the middle of a forest ) .
In all those cases people needed to take risks , but risks that had a meaning on their culture and circumstances .
In this sense only people how is brave enough to take the risk have the chance of being different can be successful .

I definitely agree with the statement , and actually I believe that people is successful becasue those risk they have taken , have given them their success .
