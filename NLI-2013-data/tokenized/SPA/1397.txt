I do not agree with the statement .
I think that one first needs to specialize in something .
Then , after this is achieved , one can interchange ideas with people who have other specialization .

Of course I do believe that while sepecializing in some subjet , one has to keep in mind which is the place of the subjet among the rest of the other subjects .
And in this sense I think it is very important to have a broad knowledge of subjects .
Of course this knowledge will not be deep , but just an idea of the important issues of each area .

I think that in the last 50 years scientific knowledge has grown in such a way that it is impossible for anybody to dominate all the branches of science .
This may could have happend in the past , where the entire human knowledge was smaller .
But this is no longer the case .
So I think it is not sensible to intend to have a full and deep knowledge of all or many subjects .

Another related point is the laboral issue .
I think that someone who has specialized will have greater job opportunities than someone who has a broad knowledge but has no specific specialization .
At least when I read for job opportunites , all job proposals ask for specific proffessions or specializations .
I also realize this with my friends .
Those who have gotten the better jobs are those who have specialized in something .
