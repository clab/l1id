Now days , the spanish young people has another mentality .
I know a lot of people with my same age that they have time to helping the communities .
But also , I know a lot of friends that certenly they do not has any time to help .
Why ?
Because they has to study a lot and also they has to work to pay his house .

In one hand , the young people have a lot of fun and everybody knows that we can reduce that time .
And that time we can dedicate to helping their communities .
And in the other hand , a lot of people directly they do not think about this topics .
I think that side is made a very bad person .
For example , always when one of those , expreses his ideas the people of other countries tend to archieve all in the same box .

So , I think that it is a very polemic statement .
I think this is not goging to change with a statement .
We have to remote to the roofs of the people , and there change the mentality .
Also , the primary education needs to change in this type of child formation .
If you teach a kids that there exist more important things in the life than the money , the studys , or the work .
I think that the next generation they will grow in this aspect .
And the people will be more happy with thw others .
