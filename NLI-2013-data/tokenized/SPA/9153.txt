I am totally agree .
In elementary school teachers show an old way to learn about everything , specially areas of study like history , literature , geography , philosophie or civism has taken by students like a bunch of names , dates and facts that they have to memorize .

Nowdays I figured out that memorize facts is not the best way to understand .
In Graduate School I had the oportunitie of take a lot of understandable classes that I can still remember .

The best way to learn and understand at the same time is doing more than one reading , consult more than one book or one opinion about something so you can have more than one point of view .
For example , if I have to investigate about Modern Architecture may be I can talk about La Ville Savoye of Le Corbusier in Poissy , France , 1929 .
But the only thing I am doing there is taking some information that already exist and writing it down in my paper .
That is just a transcription .

But in stead of that if I try to understand the philosophical fundaments of the Modern Movement , the reasons of Le Corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origins and reasons of this architecture I will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the results of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why .

So I definitly think it is more important for students ( and for life if you think a little more about it ) to understand ideas and concepts .
It is known that a good student is the one who can explain himself all kind of concepts that the one who just has memorized a lot of information that ast least its worthless .
