Nowadays they are a lot more cars than they were before .
Althought I really think than in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use as today .

Since the invention of the oil motor , cars appeared .
It uses only grew day after day .
Today it is rare to meet somebody wihtout a car of his own or a driving licence .
But it is normal .
Yes it is .
Having a car of my own avoids taking a bus or subway , which is less comfortable and of course not that fast .
Further morre having my own car increases my self-confidence because it is me , and no one else , who drives , who has got the power .
Contrairly to this we all can see a recess on car-using , and I sincerelly thinK that this is due to cities ' massive growth and to the environmental care .

First of all is to be seriously considered the enormous growth of the important cities in the world for industrial , commercial , cultural , administrative or turistic reasons .
The result of this growht is the congestion of the cities , which makes appear those big traffic jams that take place the long journey throught .
This last consequence pushes the inhabitants to use the subway or other public transport systems .
The congestions and traffic jams will get higher as the cities grow and we will never ever want to take the car again .
Another big reason for believing that cars ' use will decrease in the next twenty years is the pollution problems .
Since the early 1970 a environmental concern has been highly spread ( amog young people at is best ) , and not only because it designs a way of life , but also because our world is seriously injured .
This make us think about all the pollution that the human being creates , and among all of this is air pollution , caused in some way by the car .
Therefore our worries will make us use the same transport so that the consume ceases , and not so many cars , for only one 's use .

To conclude i like to point out that in twenty years the car use will decrease because this both reasons .
We will think it twice when we want to take the car because of patcience and environmental concern .
Maybe that a restriction is endured by the Government which prhibites the car 's use in cities .
