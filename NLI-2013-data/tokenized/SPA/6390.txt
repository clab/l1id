I am agree , but ! ...
If we have to be very optimistics , because you never knows what is gona happen with the wars and the growing of the radicalism in the world .
Also we have to take a look to the audience who can demand this kind of product .
Everything , is so complex if we see the Petrol market , Thousands , of people , are die every month directly or not directly because this problem , so ...

Of course the first world is asking for the development of new industries in this field of the consume ( cars ) and this also , demand a lot of petrol and a lot of social politics inside the problem .
Is a delicated tool to use from EEUU against the arabian world to impose his power to take the fuel for the cars , because directly or indirectly all the industries of the cars ( even if exist in Japan ) have something made in America .

In my opinion , ...
could be too long to explain my real idea about that ...
I mean , last week I passed my driving permission , Now I am crazy about drive , I would like to buy a cheap car to carry my Double-bass with me , to go to the gigs without the help of anybody ...

But in twenty years , may be I would like to go by bus and train because the stress and polution , I thing that if we are still alive in this time , the politic about the public transport have to change , at least in Spain .
If we compare this kind of things with the countries of the north of Europe , like Holland we are very far ..
There , the public transports are much more eficience .
Also , for the people is cheaper , there are much more trams , and trains ( wich is more ecologic ) and they have more buses in the stations .

So I am agree because , if we do n't have a social revolution before , finally , we are gona be more `` europeans '' , and more civilizated , but we are gona lost humanity anyway ...
