That depends of what kind of tour do you need , if only you want to see turistical places or you are interested and the history of those places , or if you want to hang out by yourself knowing that your not going to know much about the places that you going to planificate everything by yourself .

A tour guide can be a good decision because he can show and also tell you about the place history , the main parts , famous parts of the places and you can learn a lot from it .
For example i went on vacation last month to the niagara falls with a tour guide and it was intresting of the evolution and the information that the tour guide oferred me .
But if you go by yourself you 're not going to learn anything you just going to take pictures and have fun .

Another reason is you can get lost without a tour guide , you dont know where to go and sometimes you can even feel lost and tired , and addition to that is more dangerous because you never know what could happen .

When you go with someone that you can ask any question that you have you feel more relaxed more confident and secure .

Another problem depends if you going with your family or is just friends or if you have kids , why ?
because of the planification , if you have kids is better to go with a tour guide that way you do n't have to deal with the problem of routes that you 're going to select , for example : the firts place that you going to land that you goint to visit , not including maps and routes that you 're goint to need not to get lost .

So the best choice will be in most of the cases going on travel with a tour guide .
