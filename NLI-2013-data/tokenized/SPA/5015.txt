Regarding the statement I consider myself absoluley in favour , since under my perspective , advertisements are intended only to persuade the reader or listener to buy the product .
They dont really care if you like or not the advertisement , they just focus on the economic effect of it .
As a result they are willing to give a wrong idea of a product in order to ensure their economic profit of it .

As a matter of example , we daily see comercials of food , where for instance food is prepared in a certain manner that it simply looks irresitible to your eyes .
They tend tu use severall implements that provide a changed version of what the food really was .
Recalling the example of a burguer we can appeciate the way in which they will show the burguer as a tentative meal .
Some aspects such as its texutre and physical appearance might be modified in order to ensure that you create a mental image of the burguer and your future meal might be it .
Also they can create or manipulate people comments regarding the burger so that for instnace you get to know what other felt when eating such meal .

Another type of prduct that tends to be used for advertisements are the excersice machines , that are shown to be easier to work on , and proved to have inmediate results .
The main objective of this is to sell a determined apparatus that will provide what they think your body requires , for instance The AB Pro is a machine to work on where you by just slightly moving train your muscles and reinforce their shape .
The advertisement uses well prepared and fine physically people to use the machine in order to give you the idea that after using it , you will end as that person .

The truth is that advertisements actually provide us of information concerning severall product .
However due to the fact that their objective is to promote a product they are prepared to modify the products in some aspects in order to ensure the selling of it .
Just like the example given of the buguer and the machine where you actually see a changed product in order to persuade you on buying that particular object .
Obviously the modification they do on the product is intended to make it look better , so that you are willing to buy it .
