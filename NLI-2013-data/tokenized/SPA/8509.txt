I agree .
The students should understand the ideas that they are studying .
The learning process is not about memorize chapters and concepts , it is about understanding and analyzing .
If they understand the ideas and concepts they would not have problems to `` learn facts '' .
They would be capable of solve problems , which is the idea .

Education is about what the student is capable to do , per example , if the student has a bad situation , a problem or other struggles , his proof would be try to find by himself what he needs to do to get out of the situation .
His level of education would help him to analyze the problem and then , solve it .
This man will think about what he has learned and after that he will find a conslussion for his problem .
Other example , would be a person without any educational level .
This person would not be capable of get a fast conslussion because he has not had any educational help in all his life , which means that he has not developed his razoning part at school .
For this reason , education is not just a word that indicates `` go to school '' ( college or universities , in other cases ) , it is a word that indicates : `` analyzing '' , `` logical '' or `` learning '' .

If some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pass that subject , he would use his logical skills to solve the problem .
The most logical response to this situation would be go with a tutor to get help .

I do not agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn facts because would be a support to those people who just memorize things and they call smart to themselves .
In some situation would be good to learn facts , but it would not be the point of the educational matter .
The point is try to learn and analyze situations in life .
For these reasons , the understanding is most important in a student ' educational process .
