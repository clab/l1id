The life is a very beautiful gift that each person receive and a great adventure .
Somebody can think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do , but it is not always true .
Each person can enjoy the life in many ways without take in mind their age and living each moment of their life like it were the last .

Many times , youngs prefer go out and attend to parties with many friends , have a dinner , watch a movie , play any sport , or simply doing funny things .
The family is also very important , and they consider that is good stay with the whole family in special dates , for example for birthdays .

Old people also enjoy at the same way , staying either with the family or with friends , but having good times .
Many people at this age also enjoy reading or watching television but they feel happy .
The activities maybe can not be the same , but the quality of each moment is very important .
Many old people are example for young that have not learned to enjoy their lifes .

Sharing with the family and friends is one of the most important things that each person enjoy , and doing thinks that are important for every one .
The age is not important to have good times , the best clue is feeling good in all moments of the life .
Finally , the life is only one and we have to lear to enjoy it every day .
