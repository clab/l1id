LEARNING IDEAS FOR UNDERSTANDING FACTS

When students first start a course , they want to know what the methodology of the class is goin to be .
Students are interested in knowing the curriculum and the course description .
Once they know all of these details , the teacher helps them reach the proposed goals .
Every course a student attends , exposes him/her to learn facts and to understand ideas and concepts .
However , for students is more important understanding ideas and concepts than learning a certain fact .

Nowadays , there is an approach to teaching pedagogy called learning for understanding .
This approach , consists in acquiring knowledge through internalizing ideas and concepts .
In other words , the learning for understanding approach , stands that once a student is able to understand a concept or and idea , he will easily learn the facts that support it .

Although this approach is not directly exposed to the students , they unconsciously prefer to learn facts by understanding the concepts and ideas on which it is founded .
A student , finds it more interesting to discuss , to explore or simply to inquire on a theme .
Therefore , once they have a reason to research , they start to inquire .
In this way , students are able to learn from details , conjectures , opinions , concepts and ideas to be capable to reach the facts that support the investigation .

This is a kind of inductive method to acquire knowledge .
It can be boring for a student to start with theoretical facts just to discover new ideas , because the student will be first exposed to a list of theoretical concepts that may demotivate his learning process .
On the contrary , if the student is guided to an inquiry , he will be interested in questioning , exploring , debating and understanding facts .

Finally , the process of learning should captures a students ' attention with any kind of motivation , and what really motivates students is to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn a list of facts .
And this conclusion has to become a fact to keep in mind because this new approach can encourage teachers to change their pedagogic ass .
