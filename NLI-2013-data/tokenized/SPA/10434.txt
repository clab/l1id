Being a successful person makes yourself responsable on maintaining that success in many different aspects .
I completely agree on the fact that successfull people should try new things and take risk because it will give the person confidence , experience , knowlegde , independence among other characterics that a successful person should have and never forget .

One point in favour is that successful people should try new things to get experience even in things that have anything to do with their area of success .
In fact , a successful person has usually studied before and has a good level of education and experience on its field to achive her o his success correctly .
For example , a successful colombian singer who goes to music school in Colombia and then goes to a music academy in India will have not only the knowledge of Indian music but the experience of being in another country surrounded with a different culture and people .
Furthermore , this will give the Colombian singer a range of new ideas that will probably be reflected in new styles of music , lyrics that he or she will manage to learn and use due to the experience of being in India .

Another point to support the importance of taking risk is the fact that you never know what is going to happen in the future .
Taking a risk being successful helps already because of the prestige that your name already has .
For instance , my dad to the risk of quiting his last job because he wanted an independent company even thou he had a good salary .
However , he manage to create his new coal company with old working partners that he met during a conference in last job where he was very successful as the general administrator of a marine port .
His success and popularity in his last job helped him after many years to gain the confidence and trust of new working partners .

Finally , to maintain success you have to take risks in life
