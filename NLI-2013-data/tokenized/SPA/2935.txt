I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I am certain of this statement because of three reasons , they do not have as many responsabilities , they are most likely to be in a better physical condition , and devote more of their time into pleasing themselves .
All of these characteristics enable a young person to enjoy life more than old people .

The majority of young people have minimum responsabilities .
The responsabilities that they have mainly consist of taking care of themselves .
For instace , wash their clothes , go to school , walk the dog .
In the case of adults , this implies going to work for long hours , having the pressure of mantaining a family and taking care of their children .
Young people do not have to carry this burden and have more free time to do whatever they please .
This enables them to take walks , to run and go out experiencing life in a spontanous and stress-free manner , thus , enjoying life more .

Another reason why young people are able to enjoy life more than older people is because they are most likely to be more physically adept .
By having a better body , meaning stronger muscles and bones , young people are able to perform more physical activities .
For example , if for a person one of the greatest pleasures in life is climbing a mountain in Huaraz they are able to accomplish this effectively with a good physical condition .
In the case of old people who could suffer from calcium defficiency , their bones would restrict them from performing this activity .
This example clearly depicts how a young person can enjoy life more than an older one .

Because of the fact that young people take more time in fulfilling their personal needs , they are able to enjoy life at its fullest .
They are most likely thinking about themselves and what makes them happy .
Since they do not have to worry about other things , and school is not excessively time consuming young people have more spare time .
For instance , a young person may not do as many tasks as an older one so they are less tired at the end of the day .
This puts them in the position to be able to go out with his or her friends .
This is another scenario that illustrates how young people can take more advantage of life than old people .

Consequently , having less responsabilites , being in a good physicial condition , and having more time to please oneself are key characteristics that young people have and that allow them to enjoy life more than a person of an older age .
