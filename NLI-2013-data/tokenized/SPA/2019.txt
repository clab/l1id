I think there is not a moment in your life more pleasant than other , the whole life is a cicles of growing personally and intelectually , and one should enjoy every step in this cicle , so I disagree with the statement .

People should enjoy every moment in their lives , because every moment brings you different satisfactions and all of them are equally pleasant .
As a child one enjoy a lot being in the kindergarden , and playing with the other children there isnt anything else more exiting than that .
The same occurs as a student in highschool or at the university , meeting new people , sharing with them and all the things around it are very exiting .
By this point there arent a lot of responsabilities , and that is what make people think that being younger you enjoy life more .
But responsabilities do n't take away the exitement in life .

After the university you star working , most people get married , have children and with this come the responsabilites , but who said this was n't pleasant .
I still have no kids to take care of , but I really want to get married and have a lot of children , and I think I would continue enjoying life as I am right now as a young person .
Even work give great satisfactions , and I really enjoy working in things I like .
It is all just moments in your life , and each moment give a diferent kind of satisfaction .

In an older age , satisfaction must come from people around you , and the achivements you have done in your life .
I think it must be very pleasant to see what you have done in your life and share it with the people you love .

In conclusion one must enjoy every moment of life , because every moment comes with great satisfactionds
