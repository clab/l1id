The idea that people who takes risks have more opportunities to succed rather than people who do n't , is a concept that is gaining more and more attention in modern society .
In most of the cases , people who experiment wiht new things can prduce a massive effect in society , creatting a whole new paradigm .
This idea can helps us not only to apreaciate the individual talent of some mebers of a group , but it also can be understand as a synonim of progress .

Nowadays , there are many examples that reflects how succesfull people usually takes more risks .
In the last three edditions of `` Harvard Bussines Review '' , the main articles defined inovation and intuition as a synonim of succes .
They also pointed a big list of bussines men who were able to reinvented their own companmies , trying different things and avoiding `` what they allready now how to do well '' .
Althoug for many people this can be a safe way to run a bussines , I belive that if a company or organization is not able to push its own limits and see what others ca n't see , the pressure of the model will make it dissapear .

Another example that reflects the succes of people or entities who try new things is the case of Amazon .
com .
This company basically offers a frienly paltafform to have acces to services online .
Althouhg its looks very simple , Amazon was able to fill and space that was empty : sells products online .
At the begining this plan was considered unprofitable and maby too `` crazy '' , but soon they became one the most profitable companies of the world , and they still remain as the most visited website since the Internet appeared .

In conclusion , I belive that inovative people who take risks and try new things can deffinitly have more oportunities to succed , but what is more important , the can push the limits of society helping us to find a new way to progress .
