I strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group with a person that can guide you in the place where you are going .
I believe that this is important in order to know a place because I usually like to visit places with a good historical background .
If I want to take advantage of the time while I am travelling , and this time is limited , I do not want to waste it , just trying to recognize what places are important in that city or location .
For instance , if I go to Italy , I would love to go to all the museums , and famous restaurants .
I also would enjoy the opportunity to go to the beaches in the mediterranean sea .
Normally , a tourist would need more than a month just to plan these activities .
However , if you go with a tour guide , this person will make your life a lot of easier , because he or she already knows where to go , at what time , what are the important parts where a tourist should focus his attention .
Last year , my family went to Dominican Republic .
We bought a all inclusive plan , but we did not have a guide .
We were totally lost there , we did not know where to go .
All the time people were taking advantage of us charging an incredible high amount of money for different services like taxi transportation , only because we do not have anybody that could give us advice or information about the usual fare for that kind of service .
We had to pay $ 20 for buying a sunprotector .
The most expensive sunprotector in my whole life .
Also , sharing your vacations with a group of friends is really wonderful .
I would say that it could n't get better if you are travelling with the people you like and with somebody that already have a plan for you .
