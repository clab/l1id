Being an experienced person is always good , not only will it help you in life but it also proves that you are not an ignorant .
Having a broad knowledge over many topics is necesary in a world like today ; this is why we have many subjects to be studied both in school and university .
Though this is not enough in a society like today 's .

To be succesful it is necessary for people to specialize on a certain topic of their choice .
Without majoring and becoming a profesional on a subject your chances of having a good life now a day is scarce .
People consider that studying is one of the most essential parts in life which is necessary for having a good and secure future .
Personally agreeing in the matter I am experiencing something similar .

As a high school senior applications is something that you must do to continue with your education .
Being accepted into college is wonderful and necessary to secure a good future not only for yourself but for your upcoming family .
What is difficult is to decide what you want to study , as the world becomes more competitve , you also want to study something you like .

Everyone knows that in a university you will not only study the subject of your choice but you will also be taking many other basic courses .
Having a broad knowledge over things is necessary and that is why colleges and universities obligate you to learn other material .
Emphazising on your specific major is also a must and that is why most colleges and universities recommend declaring a major as soon as possible .

Being a profesional in a world like today is something we have learned to look forward to .
Increasing your knowledge is what most people really want but to do this one must study .
Sadly having an extensive knowledge isnt enough to prosper in this world and that is why one must also specialize in a determined subject .
