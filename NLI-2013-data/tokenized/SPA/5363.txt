Marketing has evolved throughtout time and has become more complex as time pases .
What used to be very simple , like introducing a new product to a market , has become a real challenge .
Now a days there are so much markets that are compiting between them , that the product that has the best marketing strategy is the one with the biggest revenues .

The best way to obtain attention from the clients , is showing them a product that covers all their needs , products that can do everything at the same time .
That is why most products seem much better than they really are , because there is no such product that can cover all , and even most , of the needs or wants of the posible buyer .

In television most products that are being advertised , really does not work .
That is why they tell you `` if you call within the next 2 minutes you will get a bonus pack '' , this way they get the attention of the person , by making them think they are getting not only the fabulous product , but also the amazing bonus pack , distracting them from the real product .

Another way of getting the attention of posible buyers is buy selling them lies .
Advertisements tell you all the things that the product can do , but really most of the time it just works partially , or not at all .

At the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lots of promotions , that at the end does not satisfies the custumer .
It is really important to show what you are really selling , that way costumers will be satisfied with what they are buying , and they will continue to buy the best brand .
