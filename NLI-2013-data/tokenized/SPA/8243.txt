It is well known that the amount of information is increasing exponentially and because the develpment of global and massive comunication technologies such as internet , the avalaiblility of information is increasing too .

That is the reason why traditional educational methods must be reconsidered .
Indeed , it is virtually impossible to aboard knowledge procecess , with only memory-focus aproaches considering the human limitations , and the amount of information available .
I think is better to try make the students to learn and understand ideas and concepts rather than try to make them learn a lot of facts .
However I consider as necessary fact to give them enough skills for searching and handling information propertly .
In addition , students should learn in their classes how to correlate concepts , facts , and ideas in order to develope new conceps .
That is the way knowledge and science grow up .

The memory can fail some times ( I know that by my own experience ) , but the concepts are always there to help .
I think that as an example of what I am saying is the science symposiums and meetings .
The speakers just have like twenty minutes or so to talk about their research projects which had taken them several years in most of the cases .
So what they do ?
They talk about the concepts they studied and they developed .
In conclude , I think that the students that have clear their concepts can go on faster in learning precesses .
