I prefer having a broad knowledge of different academic subjects that specilizing in one specific subject .
Specializing in an specific field is not a weird decition , we can see in our daily lifes that there is a lot of people that in the last year of degree decide to continue studying in an specific field of knowledge .
However , under my own point of view and experience I prefer having a large knowlenge in different subjets , because this is translated into a person who is able to face with different topics in a discussion or debate .

First of all , I would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future I will like to work in a bussiness in which to do a dynamic work .
I mean , consultants , for instance , change the projects in which they are working every week , so they have to deal with different subjects , such as telecommunications , energy resources , economy ...
That is what I like !!!

However , as I said before , many people decide to specialize in a field .
This is the case of proffessors at university .
For example , in the faculty of Chemistry we can find different departments : organic chemistry , inorganic chemistry , thermodinamics ...
Proffessors have to specialize in a subject because they are dealing every day with the same aspects , and they need to know as much as possible about a certain field .

The best of all would be to have a large knowledge of lots of subjects , but this is not possible today for human being , because our brain can not retain so much information .
Even though , I have heard of people that have studied like 5 or 6 degrees .
I think this is fantastic !!!
This people are very lucky of being so intelligent .

All in all , I think that in the world should be both kind of people : those who specialize and those who have a broad knowledge of different subjects , because both of them are neccessary in different situactions .
