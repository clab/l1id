I agree with this statement that said `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreary know how to do well . ''
The reason because I agree with this statement is this .
If successful people only do whatever they know very well , we will have around the world the same things .
For example , cars , if the people who are encharge to biuld new models of cars , and they do not try to do something new , how boring , we do not have a lot of options , but because they take risks we have a numerous options when we are looking for a car , you , me , everybody can buy all kind such as : a BMW , a Jaguard , a Camry , a Jeep , etc .
As well people who want to start a new restaurant , the want to oppend something new .
If in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some Chiness , Greek , or Text Mexican food , but they do not have a real Mexican Food , I think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area .
Another example is Fashion , women love fashion , they do not use the same clouth , they changed almost the 365 days during the years .
The new disainers are fightting each other in order to have the best disign , they are risking , but if he or she disign is the best , they will get a good income .
If you do not risk , I almost sure , you wo n't win .
Take a risk and you will be successful in life .
In life we need to risk most of the time .
You make risk when you want to change to another job because you can get better salary , but who knows that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to another city , it is risky but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the only thing you need is trust in yourself .
