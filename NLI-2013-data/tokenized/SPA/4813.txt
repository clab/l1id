Advertisements usually make products seem much better than they really are .
When a person walks down the street or is walking around in a mall , they are able to see all kind of flyers that exageratet the best characteristics of the products they are advertising making them look better than what they are .

From my personal experience I can say that this is true .
Once when I was around twelve a company called me to see if I wanted to do a comercial for a new cookie that was going to be sold in Panama .
Since I was a kid and they were going to pay me , I said that I would do it , no problem .
When I got to the place , they handed me a script , I was suppose to eat the cookie , and it didnt matter if it was good or bad but i had to pretend that I liked it anyway .
I went to work with other kids that were going to make that cookie look good .

When we started filming , instead of handing us regular cookies out of the box they were special cookies , these were taken appart and they had been added double fudge , so they lookked better , and they were made presentable by some guy who was fixing the vanilla fudge inside the cookie with a knive .
Instead of us using normal cookies from the package , they had to make special cookies that looked better than what they reallt tasted , because i can surely say that the cookies looked good but they didnt really taste that good .

Not only this happens with food but also with toys .
For example the hot wheel comercial for kids look great .
On TV you would think the cars are able to do flips and land back on track and keep going no problem , but once you buy that item , the thing falls appart .
The wheels of the car start falling , it jumps out of the track to never land on it againa , and to put the track together is almost as hard as trying to build a rubiks cube .

In conclusioin Items in advertisements always look better than what they really are , so people can sell them .
This is a selling technique , but you have to be careful , because you can exaggerate what an item does , but you can make it up .
Therefore , to be able to sell something , in the advertisement it has to look better than what it really is , and that is what people usually do , and based from my experience I think that is exactly what goes on .
