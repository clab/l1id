Many people belive that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I think that it depends on the individual circumstances and demands that people assumed .
Through essay , this idea is going to be disscused .

In order to contribute to the development of the society , every person need to be aware of what is needed or required from him or her in the role that is playing .
For example it is important for a researcher or scientist to have a deep knowledge of the subject that he is studying because he is producing futher knowledge in this very specific topic .
It is not relevant for a researcher in microbiology to know information about history of art because it is irrevant to his duty .
In other hand , it is important for a second grade teacher to know about many topics in a elemental way because her job is to provide the children with basic knowledge to make them capable to undertstant more complicated concepts in the future .
Probably in the future this students will receive more complicated information in each subject by people who are specialist in his own topic .
This is a team work .
As a society everyone has an important and different contribution to do and the knowledge or academic preparation is what make possible to do it well .

In conclution , the role that everyone plays in the society is what determine the knowledge that every one should have .
