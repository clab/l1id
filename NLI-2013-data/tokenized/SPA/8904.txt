I think both are important .
To learn ideas an concepts help to us to ubicate in a context and time .
Normally , they are very useful when there are not experience in one subject .
Concepts help to start to know about any issue and then , normally people start to develop your own judge about things and understand the different alternatives that exist for a problem .

In the other hand , Facts are also imporatant because bring to us part of the knowledge and helps to bring more information .
I think every fact must to be acompanied by concepts and ideas clearly understood .
Facts help to us to have a general idea about some special issue and help us to ubicate in the context we want to develop .

Also facts helps to understand about anything in a very brief manner , they are very useful when there is a short period of time for analyze information or know about something .
i.e. If you are a customer and need to know about some company , it will be very helpful to have a spreadsheet of the company with the main facts .
After that you will have to investigate more about that fact but it is very helpful for initiate that investigation .

Concepts helps to support any idea that each person want to develop , also help to understand how the things works and evaluate diferent options .
Concepts are essential part of our life .
If we dont have concepts , we dont have knowledge , so we need to be guessing all the time .

It is important to mention that to know a concept is not enough , the most important issue is understand it , because once we know the concept and understand it we can apply our own ideas , other concepts , solutions , etc. and find a logical solution to almost all the things .
