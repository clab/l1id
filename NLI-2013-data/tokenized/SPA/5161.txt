The marketing have devoloped very fast , the companies every day are discussing what they have to do to sale more and how they can attract more consumers .
The advertisement is a good technice to obtain their goals .

The statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are '' is a true .
The advertisements make the people believie that the products are as they show in the television or in the magazines .
I have lived this expirience with a shampoo .
I have a very curly hair so I need a shampoo that do n't lets me see as a lion .
When I watch in the television the advertisement of Pantenne 's shampo that lets your hair very curly but not as a lion I thought it was the best solution to my hair , so I went to buy it inmediately .
The first time I used it was a dissaster , it did n't works as they show in the advertisement and also my hair began to fall .
In that moment I undestood that you cannot believe in the advertisments .
Other example to support my opinion is when I went to Isla Margarita in Venezuela .
I chose the hotel that I saw in the web page , it seems very comfortable and beautiful , but when I arrived to the hotel , I was very dissapointed because it was n't what I was expecting .
The room was very small , the air conditioning was damaged and the food wasn ; t good .
The same day arrived I changed to another hotel , which was spectacular .

The advertisments make believe the consumers what they not really are .
The companies are trying to attract consumers by showing them false attributes of the products and by this way the companies will have to replant their advertisments , because it would cause damage in their image and the people will not buy again their products .
