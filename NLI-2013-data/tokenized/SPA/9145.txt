I firmly agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to learn how to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts and data .
It may be true that facts are basic for a successful academic career , however for all the rest of the human beings it is just personal enrichment .
It may also be true that learning raw data is a very rewarding experience , but again I would suggest to focus this desire on more stimulating and challenging activities .

First , facts are much easier to forget than ideas .
I am sure that no friend of mine from school will remember all the names of the rivers in our country , but they maybe can remember why the PC has been so important in the development of our culture .
Therefore , it is much more useful to learn something that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsense tough data , which you have to read over and over because it does n't have any logic behind !

Second , in our work we hardly use specific facts .
But we certainly use ideas , concepts , arguments and logical discussions .
At least I do in my consulting job .
I have learned to structure my thoughts and put into practice improvement levers simply by understanding and applying ideas , not by remembering facts .

Third , facts can be looked again and again in books whenever we want .
Nowadays , there is no problem in finding information .
We can just connect to the Internet , make a search and find it right there .
When I do n't remember a formula , I just do that .
Google is my good friend when I have memory loss .
Maybe other people just have a neighbour that knows it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field .
I could go on saying that what the world lacks are good ideas , revolutionary thoughts that can improve the society we live in .

This last idea leads me to my final argument : facts are part of the past while ideas are the raw material of the future .
The formula of a circle has been invented many years ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pending subject and only with good ideas we will suceed in this matter .
We should be engaged in providing an outstanding ideas-focused education to the future Einsteins .
For instance , during my education in high school in the USA I experienced a quite different approach compared to the European one .
We should foster this type of education .

Summing up , my opinion is that students should learn what will be useful for them and for the society as a whole .
Consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .
