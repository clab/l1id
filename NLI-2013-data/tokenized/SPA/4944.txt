It seems possible to affirm that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are .
However , one must not forget that that is the `` nature of the beast . ''
After all , companies hire a multi-billion dollar machinery to convince us , avid consumers , of our need to look just like the perfect models from suburbia that are used not only to sell products , but also to use our vanity and lust to lure us to buy , buy , buy .

Let me give you an example of the way advertisment companies use our desire to look great and to be desired to make us buy their products .
Two days ago I went to the movie theater .
While I was waiting for my movie to begin , I was bombarded by a miriad of commercials advertising all sorts of products , all the way from beauty creams to cigarrettes .
After the third commercial with the sporty type advertising gym clothing , a membership to a trendy sports facility and the required pills to burn fat , I was feeling fat , grossly inadequate , and ready to run so that I could get all I needed to get on the right track .
All of a sudden , a deep realization struck me : all of that cannot be real !
I can exercise to the point of exhaustion , get all the right clothing , take all the prescribed pills -- not by a medical doctor , mind you -- and even then , I will never look like the blonde , blue-eyed , muscular guy on the screen .
Do n't believe me yet ?
Just ask yourself : how many curvacious women or Apollinean guys have greeted you at the car dealership last time you bought a new car ?

Some people would like to say that advertisements are nothing but a clear reflection of the products they offer .
While I am willing to concede that there is just little you can do to make a glass of milk look more apetizing than what it is , one has only to look at the `` Got Milk ? '' advertisements to get the point : to advertising companies , it does not matter if what they are offering is as good as they say it is , or even if the attention of the consumer is not so much on the product they are selling but on the personality they are using to advertise it , what matters to them is that it sells .

How many times have you been moved to get the trendiest , newest , more expensive brand of clothing , cellular phone , car , etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that , in spite of all the empty promises and alluring techniques used by the advertising company , what you got is nothing but apiece of trash ?
Think about the famous Marlboro commercials .
How many people thought that smoking was a fancy activity just by looking at the romantic sunset with the cowboy looming on the horizon ?
How about the effects of smoking on your health ?
Care to talk about cancer and related illnesses ?
Obviously , truth-telling and advertising do not go hand-in-hand .

Most advertisement companies want one thing and only one : to sell their clients ' products .
If they need to lie , modify , or even disguise the real product or its effects in order to sell it , that is exactly what they will do .
Got milk lately ?
