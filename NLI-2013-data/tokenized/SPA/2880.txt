I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The statement is very vague and general to begin with , and furthermore , it provides no support as to what enjoying implies .

It is not correct to generalize or stereotype such large numbers of people .
Young people , as well as older people , are very different amongst each other .
Some young people enjoy life , while others hate it , and the same happens with older people .
Assuming that generalizing is correct , though , I would still disagree with the statement .

One cannot compare `` apples with oranges '' .
When it comes to young people , enjoying life might mean enjoying going to parties or clubs to dance and meet new people .
When speaking of older people , enjoying life could mean enjoying reading a good book or listening to classical music , or even sleeping !
Even though at first glance a party might sound more fun or enjoyabel than sleeping , the older person might actually enjoy sleeping much more than the young person enjoys partying , and therefore be enjoying life even more .
A past experience with my grandfather illustrates my point perfectly .
I always thought he was very boring and that his life was pretty sad , given the fact that he stayed home most of the time .
However , I once walked into his study where he was just sitting on a couch holding my grandmother 's hand , quietly listening to classical music , and I realized his eyes were watery with emotion .
He was enjoying that moment so deeply it was hard for me to understand , but I realized he simply enjoyed life in a very different way that I did ; not more , not less , simply different .

Furthermore , `` the older the wiser '' explains my disagreement even further .
With experience , people experiment many activities and situations in life , and they learn to identify which ones they enjoy more .
A more experienced or older person has learned over the years to enjoy specifically those things that make them the happiest .
By focusing more specifically on those things that they like , older people enjoy life more deeply .
On the other hand , young people tend to expose themselves constantly to new experiences , and even though there is a thrill to getting to know new things , it is usually with time that one learns to actually enjoy experiences to their fullest .
Young people , in their constant attempt to explore new things , usually dont have time to focus enough to actually get to enjoy things to their deepest .

The statement is a vague and unsuported generalization , which makes it difficult for me to agree with it .
Every person is different , regardless of age , and what one person might enjoy , another might not .
This does not imply that either person is not enjoying life , or enjoying it to a different degree .
