Before giving my opinion , I would like to clarify that each thesis can be right beacuse nobody knows the future .
However , I believe that in twenty years there will exist more cars than they exist today .
I think this for three reasons .

Fist of all , people and the word is getting richer .
We are increasing our power of acquistion , and by consequent , we will be able to buy more items .
For example , a family who has only a car , but they need one for the father , one for the mother and another for the children , is not going to hesitate to buy another car if they can financially .

Moreover , driving cars and the world of the motor belongs definitively to our culture and we can demonstrate this idea when we observe young people .
For instance , I am a young person and since I was eight years old , I have been dreaming to have my own car .
Furthermore , my friends who are nineteen years old , drive their own car , and they would like to buy always another one .

Besides this idea , prices of cars are going down and we can notice that nowadays even poor peole have their own car .
The reason that prices are cheaper , is because there are lot of sellers and that is why these people need to increase the market , and by consequent , there will be more people with car .

Nevertheless , I recognize that the price of petroleum will reach a considerable amount of money .
Thus , buyers will be afraid to buy more cars and so , to spend more money in gas .
Fortunately , scientits will discover another way to provide energy to cars .
Another important point is that people are getting more ecologists , and the idea of using car will be seen in a bad way .
Ecologists will have an important word to say in a soon future .

In conclusion , I think that there will be more cars in the future and that it will not be avoided by some reasons like energy or he ecologists .
Personnally , I would prefer to live in a healthier world .
