Knowing about the place you are planning to visit is an important thing to do .
Having enough information allows you to be more confident when the time for you to travel is coming .
I usually do this thats why I 'm not so sure about travelling with a tourist guide as the best option for me .

It can be a hard situation for me to adjust my time to a schedule plan , being under pressure makes me feel unconfortable and with not energy to be part of a group even if that group is great and nice .
I love being with people I love in a pleasure trip for example , and if I have to be with the time on my back the whole time , I would feel horrible for not enjoy the trip as I wish .

I know that a tourist guide gives you a lot of knowledge and experience but I 'd rather make the travel by my own and be able to know about the things I 'm interest in .
Making everything I want and going wherever I want .
Step by step , not in a rush .
That 's what I mean by saying that knowing everything I can about the place I 'm going to visit is so important .

Also , It feels like a boring situation to me being with a group I do n't even know , I do n't have any idea of how they are and that could be a problem when it comes to share situations and happy moments during the trip .
I admit that It can be exciting if I do the trip only by myself but not if I 'm travelling with the family or a large group of friends .

Being in a travel with a group is not an option for me in most of the times , but I can say I wo n't do it in the future .
