Education goals have changed in the past few years .
People have become aware that school represents a whole world where kids are exposed to a great variety of situations .
From daily tasks like reading a passage or keeping the classroom clean to how to deal with an abusive classmate or the first love .
If that much is at stake then education can not be aimed to learning facts only .
There are also other reasons that support the statement that education must be based on the understanding of ideas as well on the acquiring of skills .
First , skills as well as the understanding of ideas last forever and they are universal .
The processes involved can be used anywhere , anymoment .

Second , they serve as tools for dealing with a less narrow variety of situations as opposed with the memorization process that is involved in the learning of a fact .
And as tools they can be used to find new and alternative ways to apply the same ideas .

Third , they improve your abbility of making connections which is very important nowadays when knowledge is too vast to grasp .

Finally , they can be custumized to every student 's needs .
Facts imply that every one should memorize them in the same way while if the teacher is taking in account the personal abbilities of each person then a personal approach is rea I believe that when teacher and students only want to study and learn facts they will enclose the knowledge and they will narrow their opportunities to develop in a world that has become more and more ecclectic .

Even though the statement referes only to the students , teachers have a great deal to learn , first they should discover what motivates them to teach in a certain way and then they should evaluate whether their methods are reaching more that memory or if otherwise they are helping students to reach higher standarsds .
