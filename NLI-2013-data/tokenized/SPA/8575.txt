i disagree with the statement even thoug i think it is more importan to understand ideas and concepts .
Most of the estudents are more concerned about facts because facts can be proved , facts can show you the right and the wrong way to do things .
When you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefere facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
in my opinion tradicional countrys like mine prefered to teach ideas and concepts so tha you can developed as you want , in the other hand more developed contries prefere to teach facts that you can put easally in practice and you dont have to spend time triyng to proved if thing work right or wrong .
One of the major reason developed contries teach facts is the value of the time , time has become a treasure that you have to improve , time goes fast and cost money .

Understanding ideas and concepts will leave you the main ideas , the estructure the formation , is up to you to thake advantage of this an try to developed an take in to facts of your own experience .

Facts are really imoportan and if you now how to use them you will have more arguments to deal wiht live
