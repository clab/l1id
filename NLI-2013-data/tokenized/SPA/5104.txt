The Advertisements and the real life

Thanks to the globalization and the acces to the differents communication technologies ( TV , Internet , Movil telephones ) everybody is in touch with the advertisements and the products that publicity try to promote .
But they are always saying the truth about their products ?
or they apply the maxim `` the end justify the way '' , are we being cheating ? .
Unfortunately We are , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The first way to cheating you is through the technology .
Is well know the different technological gadgets ( photoshop , 3D max ) used in the retouch of pictures and images in the advertisement 's world , Thanks to this programs you can see whatever they want you to see , perfects bodys or shapes , tasty food etc , the only limit is the creator 's imagination .
In this escenary customers can not be sure about the real product or result and sometimes you can buy the wrong product just based in a fake appereance .

The second resourse is the use of `` beauty standart '' to promote an ideal way to look , this is specially visible on the feminine world where you have to be thin and tall to be consider a beauty person .
Most of the advertisements use that beaty standart to show their products , most of the model are really different to the real average person and when you see a fashion catalogue and try to buy the same clothes for your `` normal size '' it does not look as good in you because you bought just an ideal not a really image .

The last resource to cheating you is the massive use of technical or cientific support to make a legimatizacion in their products .
One example are the diet pills , all the `` infomerciales '' shows the cientical studies that support the effectivity of their products , but any has a good study , with the adequate methology .
