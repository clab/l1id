There is no one universal way to be successful in life .
We all would like to know the way we could be successful in any or many aspects of our lifes .
But , the reality is that there is not just one way that we can follow that will asure us of being successful .

I believes that one of the many different ways we can try to be successful will be not to be afraid of trying diferent things .
We will not always have the opportunity to try things in a diferent way .
But , everytime time it is possible for us to do what we are trying to do in a different way than the way we are used to do it , we should not be affraid of do it .

There are some people that believes that in order to make a big profit , ones have to take a big risk .
This theory will apply not only in the economics , but also in many other different aspects of our lifes .
We can make big profits or get a lot of beneficits after taking a big risk at school or even in our personal relationships .

In our finances banks usually calculate the interest they will pay you for your money based on the amount of risk that you are taking .
If you want to be very safe with your money you can open a saving account or a CD .
These account will be a very safe way to keep your money but it will not pay you a lot of interest .

You can be safe by staying within your confort zone in an especific area .
Doing that , you will avoid doing things that you may not be good at but it will also limited the amount of areas that you can be successful at .

Tere are many ways in how we can became successful .
It will all depends of the amount of risk that you are willing to take at the time of doing somethings that you have not tried to do before .
Do new things , try different ways , push your limits and see how far you can go .
