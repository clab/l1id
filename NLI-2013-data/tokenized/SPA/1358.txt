Do you remember everything you studied ?
Probably not !
However , if you once studied a subject in depth you will probably have experienced that the lessons drawn from that studying have had long-lasting effects .
Specializing in a specific study subject is a great choice , since this will allow the student to trully enjoy the subject , to acquire a profound knowledge of it and , ultimately , to apply this knowledge to further subjects of study .

When someone studies something in depth , he usually enjoys the subject more than when his or her study is superficial .
How can someone for instance enjoy History , when it is taught only as facts and dates ?
Conversely , a deep knowledge of the context and causes of historic events , may make the study of History an amazing and exiting experience .

Furthermore , a thorough study of a specific subject allows the student to retain the subject more easily , because the knowledge so acquired has deeper roots .
We have surely all experienced the contrary : trying to embrace many subjects for our school exams and ultimately forgetting everything once the exams had passed .
By studying someting in depth , the chances of this frustrating experience will significantly decrease !

Moreover , the best about studying a subject in-depth is that , once we have a sound knowledge of a certain topic , we can draw links and establish relationships with other topics .
This makes the studying of further topics more simple .
My best friend majored in Art ...
you will probably not be surprised that he is also terrific in History , since any art expression is closely related to the historical context in which it took place .

For all these reasons , I strongly recommend everyone specialize in a specific subject , rather than try to gain a broad knowledge of many subjects .
The only question is , in which subject should someone specialize ?
