Successful people are special people who take advantages from the life .
They are people who have a different perspective of life in comparison with the average people .
Sometimes , to take a risk does not look convenience but it is true if we read or check the most famous biographies of successful people , we can see that is a common factor , they take a risk during their lives .
Thus , I am agree , they in at least one time of their lives took a big risk which changes all their lives .

First , successful people do not think only in survive or live life in a moderate way .
They really thing maybe since they are children in how to achieve their goals .
For example , famous deportists .
When , they are on their twenties they are consider success people .
This people worked hard during years since they were children .
They did not think , I am child , I only want to play .
No , they worked hard and they took the risk to be a children without all the rights and freedom that a normal child has .

Second , they think and dream in big .
They take risks not only one maybe during all their lives .
For example , Donald Trump .
He inherit a fortune and he works every day in this fortune .
Time ago , he lost part of his fortune doing inversions , of course taking big risks but he is another time on the top .
He took a risk , he fail but most of the time he win .

Third , successful people take away comfort for their dreams .
They maybe have a normal life without necessities but they dream with something bigger .
For example , have a different work , follow a special cause , be in another country .
Sometimes successful people are national leaders who take risks every day , but they are working for a big dream .
Moreover , they are working for their countries , for the human rights , for freedmom .
At the end of their lives they are recongnized for all the world as leader , as a successful person who gaves everything .

In conclusion , successful people always try more than the things that are secure for their lives .
They know how to take a risks and how to affront their consequences .
They persist to achieve their goals and sometimes people need to take risks because we can not win something big if we do not make sacrificies or assume risks .
