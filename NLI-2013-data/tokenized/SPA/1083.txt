Undoubtedly , this is one of the most trite debates that have taken part in the last decades .
After dedicating a big part of my energies to dealing with this so intricate topic , I reached the conclusion that the election between specializing or multiplying knowledge depends on a more deep debate , which is choosing between good education ( and here I refer to Good with capital letters ) and economic success .

Postmodern era has brought with it the problem of defying traditional views not only about the organization of the world but mainly about the virtues of certain kind of knowledges .
While in the ancient eras it was easy to grasp different disciplines , the huge increase in the mass of science production that took place during the XIX and XX th. centuries really difficulted the possibility of dealing with different types of knowledges .

Today , it seems to be that certain disciplines are clearly priviledged in the market .
Specialization is not only very valued in companies ( that may need engineers or marketing professionals ) , but in the academic world .
Although it seems to be reasonable in terms of efficiency ( the more you mechanically know anything about something , the faster you find a solution or give a response to a certain problem ) , it does not appear to be the same when facing unconventional or even life challenges .

In this last sense , I think that multidisciplinary knowledge can add value to one 's education .
Holistic visions of situations may help to deal with more complex problems and may provide people with mental frameworks for acting in different scenarios and in front of different kinds of people .
My experience has shown me that the more specialized you are , the more difficulty you find to understand problems that may go a bit beyond your perspective .
Moreover , you tend to see life through the lens provided by the discipline you are expert in .
This was very frequent for me at university , where I used to talk to professors that tended to refuse or discard theories that took ideas from other areas of knowledge .
Typically , for Political Scientists all problems arise from politics , and from Economists everything has to do with economics .
It appears to be very simplistic my statement , but I really had to pass over those situations when pursuing a multidisciplionary degree ( International Affairs ) and dealing with PhD professors from very different areas .

Unfortunately , this surplus I perceive in broad knowledge is not valued by market and , as I said before , it may be almost legitime in terms of rapid efectiveness .
However , I do not think the debate is over .
On the contrary , I think it will evolve in tandem with the evolution or cycles of human advances .
In the while , my curiosity and eagerness for really understanding all this lead me to buy books on Astronomy , zapping between National Geographic and History Channel , or listening to Religion lectures .
So far , it has been very fruitful for my life .
