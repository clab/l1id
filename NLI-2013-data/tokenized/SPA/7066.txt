Nowadays , cars roam every part of the city .
It seems as if there was never a moment in time when these vehicles are not out on the street .
However , cars could very well suffer a decrease in twenty years due to skyrocketing prices and environmental issues .

Having a car is an expensive luxury , and that may be one of the reasons why they may disappear .
Car prices are not getting any cheaper , in fact , all the commercials on television promote cars with new gadgets and more powerful engines , making buying one more expensive , and therefore making less people buy one .
Secondly , gasoline prices are increasing daily .
As a matter of fact , prices of gasoline are reaching historical records and filling a tank can cost a fortune .
Not only is the price of the gasoline worrying , but the fact that gasoline is getting scarcer by the minute will mean that once petroleum runs out , which scientists estimate will happen in 50 years , gasoline-powered cars will no longer be in use .

Not only is price a key factor in the reduction of the number of cars , but the fact that people are becoming more and more concerned with the environment is also something that could trigger the number of cars to decrease .
More and more people take public transportation , such as buses and trains , because it saves time , money , and the environment .
In the last few years more campaigns about using public transportation in Spain have been done , pointing out how cars pollute .
In fact , a survey has been carried out and the results reveal that people are becoming more environmentally friendly and that campaigs for the use of public transport are effective .
This new `` concience '' will lead people to replace their cars for cleaner ways of transport .

Last but not laest , more and more cities have public transport and this type of transport is being modernized on a daily basis .
Due to the increase of different types of public transport and their quality , many people go to work by train or bus instead of getting the car .
Not only is public transport faster and more convenient , allowing you to avoid traffic , but it is much cheaper than filling the gas tank and paying the parking meter .

All in all , cars , as I see it , will slowly tend to be used less often because of the circumstances surrounding us : Gasoline prices are skyrocketing , car prices are extremely high , the environment cannot survive if this rate of contamination continues , and there are many other better alternatives out there .
Looking closely at the matter , if not using the car saves money , time and our environment , why wait 20 years ?
Cars should be used less often right now .
