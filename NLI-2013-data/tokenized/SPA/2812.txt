My grandfather was 90 years old when he passed away .
While his life had ended , mine still continued .
However , I could in no way say that he did not enjoy life .
He was one of the most charismatic people I ever knew and if someone had had any experience about life , it was him .
One has to admit that younger people are able to move much faster , and learn much faster , but the truth of the matter is that older people have already learned their lessons , and thus are more able to enjoy life .

Nowadays , youth has the possibility of using technology , which has made life so much more fun , and provided various ways of entertainment such as movies or the Internet .
Also , the fact that we are young in the 21st century allows us to experience much more than our elders experiences during their youth .
As I was telling my friend Mike the other day , there is no way enjoy life without youth .
Precisely the fact that we have not learned our lessons yet , opens up the possibility of discovering new worlds and having new experiences , which our elders simply do n't have at the moment .

While youth does have the added bonus of more time left , older people have the added bonus of their experience .
With time , a person can learn to do new things , find new things , which will simply benefit his or her life .
For example , the fact that my dad has travelled to Paris and knows all the good places there allows him to visit them again and again , something a young person with no travelling experience will not be able to do .
Also , an older person is more likely not to depend on someone economically or legally , which allows them to be freer , than their counterparts : the young people .

In conclusion , I would say that while older people are maybe not as capable of moving as fast as younger people , age does not prevent anyone from enjoying life to the maximum point .
I will always remember my grandfather , anxious to show his experiences and colorful life to his nieces and nephews while continuing to live his live to the fullest .
