While it is always difficult to make such strong claims and there are for sure some exceptions , I overall agree with the statement .
We are living today in a much more individualistic society than twenty years ago .

I believe that the underlying reason is mainly economic .
Decades ago young students could aim for fairly reasonable job and access to decent housing without caring too much about their career .

The situation is very diferent today .
The list of requirements of accessing a good university , and ultimately a good job , is endless : languages , experiences abroad , extra-scholar activities related to your field , good grades to pass the increasingly selective filters , a renowed MBA , etc .
Competition is getting harder and students have little time left else than for carefully planning their curriculum and career in order to outperform their peers .

When I was a student , I for example added to my morning classes at the university extra daily classes in German and French , and used my summer breaks to travel abroad to hone my fluency in these and other languages .

I had obtained the degree of Camp Counselor and used it a couple of times in camps with less afluent children .
It was very rewarding from a personal perspective , but I decided to focus on my language skills .
Now with perspective , I wish I had helped more .

I know that the situation is changing now and presenting extracurricular social activites may represent valuable earning points in the selection process at some universities and even with some employers .
These experiences are a way of distinguishing the individual from the rest and stressing his or her personal value .

I believe that government should encourage social activites by proposing alternatives which let students help the community while reinforcing their curriculum .
As for example exchange programs where young people could help local communities abroad , honikng their language skills and at the same time fulfilling their wish to help out .
I know now that these possibility exists , but the role of institutions is to promote them .
Should I have know about them , I had not wasted the opportunity !
