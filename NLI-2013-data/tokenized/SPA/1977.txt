Age is not what determines to what extent we enjoy life , it is our attitude and our choices towards the enjooyments and difficulties we face along the way .
Some of the youthfoul of today think they enjoy life alot more than older people .
This is because they are entering a new stage in their lives were independence and fulfillment rules thier chioces .
They feel they have all the power in the world and what is worst they feel inmortal .
However it is not this two factors or the overwhelment of emotions that will decide how they want to enjoy life at its fullest , it is their own attitude .

A girl that just finished highschool , has all her strength to enjoy the years to come and to achieve her goals , but what if she makes the wrong choices and decides to let her college education pass by and ends up working as a receptionist instead of that mechatronic engineer she wanted to be .

Her whole life was marked by this mediocre attitude .
Instead a girl who has her mind always on track and fights for what she wants , letting go of the common momentary human enjoyments and working towards a rewarding end , will find the obstacles on her road an enjoyment as she defeats them .

This same situation happens with older people .
They think that `` youthfoulness is uselessly spent on the youthfoul '' .
An old rich lawyer may often complain about her deteriorating situation an say that if she could turn back time they would do things differenty , make other choices or aim at higher goals .

The truth is that these inconformity is due , again , by the attitude and the wrong choices she displayed along her life .
On the other hand we also have men and wome who have faced maturity with a smile on their faces .
The experiences rich in their minds were achived thanks to their positive and proactive attitude towards life in general .
So , personally I do n't think that something you have no control of , such as age , can determine to what point you enjoy life .
Life may be enjoyed by a sick 80 year old farmer as well as by a healthy 17 year old waiting at the doors of destiny .

We define how to enjoy life and what it has to offer with our character .
