By many experiences that i have had when i travel , I have learn that there are to kind of traveling .
Some times you go with your family and whant to have a nice time .
And some times you just travel with some friends or your own .

I really enjoy traveling with my sisters and other menbers of my family .
But this kind of trips are the ones that you wake up early , and go tothe musseun or to any historical places .
This kind of treeps is when you will like to have a tour guide with you .
The ones owhere you enjoy time with your family in a healthy way , and also learn alot from them .

There is also the trips that you plan with ypur friends .
You do not whant a tour guide with you in this trips , this are the anventures ones .
The ones that you do not even have a place to sleep until u get there , the ones that you go and just party , the ones that you do not learn anythim from them , and just remember have of the thinks you did there .

This summer i whent to Costa Rica with some friends , we had the trip of our lifes .
Something that you will never forget , an experince that is going to be with you wherever you go .
And laf tabaut all the stupid thinks you did while you were drunk .
I just love this kind of trips .

But i cant tell you if I agree or disaggree with the statement you are giving me .
Is all in the experience you will whant to have , and what you will whant to remenber about that trip .
If you want to go in a nice trip with your family I will get a nice and good tour gide .
But if I am going just with my friends , i will just go with out a tour gide .

PS : the repetitions on paragrahp # 3 , i put it there because i like how it sound , is not an error .
I learn that methot in my Art of the Essay class .
