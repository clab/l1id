The Art of Advertising

Advertising is one of the most influencial techniques in people minds , human has invent a weapon to control the market .
Many major industries expend millions of dollars in advertisment , because advertisment is what really pop up their sales .
Products may be good , but advertisers try to make them look better .

Most of advertisments only shows the qualities of products , but deffinetly they dont show the bad face of them .

We are totally surrounded by advertisements , there are everywhere .
The cities are full of them .
Almoust all products in market are advertise in differnt places .
Our minds are fully influenced by them .

In my point of view , I agree with the statement , most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .
To support this idea a perfect example is credit card comercials : If we see a credit card comercial on TV , tit might show us an incredible vacation in the Himalayas or a beautifull yatch in the middle of the caribbean , so the first we imagine is us on that situation , then the next think we do is apply for a credit card , deffinetly we will be the next person in the Himalayas or the caribbean , and that 's not true The true is that we might have the credit card , but we cant affort the trip , we need to work harder to get the money to pay the trip , if we dont have the money to pay , we wont be able to go , and the credit card wont be as usefull as it looks .

Another example might be the food advertising , non of the foods you get , are as good as big or as tasty as the ones they show on the advertisments .

Also must advertisers are proffesionals , and they know how to manipulate producs and make the look the way people want them to look , but when people buy the products , they are totally different from what they saw in the advertisement expect .

For me , advertisement industry is valid , people can make efforts triying to show the best characteristics of a product , but what is not valid for me , is that advertisers manipulate them to show advantages that the dont have .
