There are different ways of traveling , and they are all determined by the traveler 's specific interests .
In my experience , the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide limits the options of the traveler forcing him to follow a pre-set itinerary of activities , some of his interest and some he probably wo n't enjoy .
Traveling in a large group , will imply not only to follow the itinerary but the pace of the group .

The idea of traveling should be to experience as much of the new place , people and their culture as possible .
Furthermore , it should provide personal enjoyment to who is travelling .

In our everyday life we have to comply with schedules and rules , when we are on vacation we should take advantage of this unique opportunity of having complete control and determine by ourselves how we want to spend our time .
By doing this we will release stress and tension , feel challenged and invigorated with the adventure that leaving our daily routine and comfort zone represent .

There should n't be limitations , the advancement of communications , technology and the availability of information make simple to create a tailored trip for any taste , with the freedom of adjusting it as we go .

It is important to involve people from the area when possible , specially when traveling to a foreign country where we are not used to the language and more importantly to theculture .
It is also recommendable to research and prepare a tentative list of activities prior to the trip to avoid spending valuable time once we are abroad .

A small group of friends and your own itinerary should be the best way to travel , by doing this we will enjoy a new experience with people that share similar interest and at the same time will break our daily routines by being completely free to choose exactly what we want to do .
