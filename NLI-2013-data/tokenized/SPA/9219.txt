I completely agree with this statement because ideas can be adapted depending on the circumstances and this adaptability can evolve into a successful result that was expected , so students can have the idea that if all circumstances are optimal , this result will be given .
Moreover , concepts are also important because they are not orientated to specific details of a situation , but to the general situation , so students can have a good aproximation of the result depending on the interaction of this circumstances .

On the other hand , facts can be different depending on the circumstances .
The results can vary and therefore it is difficultier to enclose a result .
In addition , facts are disputable because they usually occur in systems in which the interaction of different subsystems in that particular time brought that result .
But it is possible that the same result can never be repeated again unless the same subsystems interact at the same time and in that precise moment .

For example , Wal-Mart , one of the biggest Retailers in the world , sells ideas and concepts to its clients .
These ideas have been changing throughout time .
Sam Walton , once a Wharton student , stated that ideas and concepts can vary through time , but facts depend on each circumstance that can vary the result interacting with each other .
The demand changes constantly and the ideas that once worked for this business are now useless .
So students must learn the ideas and concepts that can vary through time and can produce different results other than facts that depend of the interaction of different subsystems .
Students will then be capable of directing those subsystems and managing them so as to get the desired results and be successful .
