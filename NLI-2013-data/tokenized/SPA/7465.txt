When people travel to remote places they ussually think that the best way of getting to know well the place they are visiting is by being in a group led by a tour guide .
This statement can be true if the person traveling is visiting the place by the first time .
Other way , by personal experience I think it is better to travel only with the people you know and without a tour guide .

The tour guides are of great help if you do n't know the place you are visiting .
In a lot of cases if you do n't travel with a tour guide you can miss a lot of places to visit because you do n't know where they are located or what is the importance of this places .
It is very important to know what are you visiting and what it represents , in the case of historical sites , biuldings , or places .

In my case , I like to travel alone .
That way I can go wherever I want , the times I want , and stay the time I want in different places .
I am an architecture 's student and obviously I like to travel .
The reason I like to travel is to know places of great architectural and historical importance and I love to have time to appreciate every corner of the place I 'm visiting .
I like to see everything , to touch everything , and to feel everything .
To do this I need a lot of time and I ca n't have someone telling me where to go , what to do , or even telling me false stories about some places .
For example , if I have the opportunity some day to visit the Versalles Palace , I would not like to have someone telling me what to look or where to go .
I will like to dance in the Mirror Hall and to smell in serenity the smelI of the garden 's flowers .

I think that if you know the place , or at least are familiarized with the place you are visiting , it is important to go in your own peace , and do things your own way so you can enjoy the best your travel .
This does not means neccesarly that if you do things more privately you are not going to enjoy the trip .
