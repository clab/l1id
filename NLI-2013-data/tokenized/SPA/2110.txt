Some people think that the young people enjoy life more than older people , while others think that older people enjoy life more than younger people .
I think that the young people enjoy life more that older people because they have a lot of time to do whatever they want and also they are not married .

I think that the young people can enjoy life more than older people because young peolpe have a lot o time to do everything .
Also I think that because young people enjoy life doing the thing that they like , such as , skaiting , snowboarding and surffing .
Also I think that the young people enjoy life because they always do the things that the old peolpe do n't want to do .
Moreover , the young people have a lot of enery to do everything , one thing that the old people do n't have because they felt taired about that .

However , I think that one kind of old people can enjoy life more than younger people , that is the old people that have a lot of money and are a little bit crazy .
I think that kind of old people can enjoy life more or seme such younger people because they have a lot of money to do everything that they want , so they do n't care about spent money .

But for all the others that do n't have a lot of money , I think that the young people enjoy life more because they are not married , so that means that they do n't have any responsability because they are alone .

I think that the young people enjoy life more than older because they have a lot of time , a lot of enery and also they can do whatever they want because they are not married , so that 's means that the young people is free to do everything in they lifes .
