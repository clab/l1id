Modern societes are thinking more individually than ever .
This is a result of multiple factors that I will shortly describe in this writting .

The first factor is the Metropoli concept .
At the beggining of the 20th century , there were no so many cities in the world with more than a million of habitants .
Today , one can realize more than 50 cities with more than 10 million of habitants .

The Metropolis has many implications in the way of living , in terms of competitivity for a workplace , time dedicated to educational activities , time and resources invested in transportation .

Day after day time invested at home is decreasing and the young people quite often do not see with treir parents as they have so many things to do , but the family is not a priority anymore .

A second factor is the revolution of communication media and all what it has brought to society .

The media influence over the people is huge .
Unfortunately what bring cash to the media companies are the stars programs .
I have not seen any top series for young that focuses their attention to comunitary programs , obviously , that wo n't have any rating .

The third factor is the lack of believes .
As a human being , is important to believe in a superior god , no matters if is christian , Methodist , Budism , etc .
The believes and practices of a religion are the basis of a community .

The final factor is that the education at schools are focusing more in technical formation than humanistic , focusing students more in `` me '' thinking than in a community thinking .

Technical education is basic , but moral education is as important and shoul be teached in the same way and intensity .

Multinational and global corporations works as a community , share a Corporate culture and values , and from my point of view , that is the only way that one could guarrantee sustainability .
One of the basis of leadership is to work in groups to bring results foto the community and youngs should be advised of the importance of helping their communities .
