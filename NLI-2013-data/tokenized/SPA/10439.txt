I do agree .
not only what you know to do would help you acomplish things , but to try new risk would help as well .
it 's true that a risk could lead you to lose everything , but it 's also true that you may gain more as well .
For example , a successful leader must have risked something very precious to him/her in order to get to where he is now .
I like to point out leaders , because I personally admire one who left everything behind , family , homecountry , friends , mony-savings , etc. for his dream of success , and took a nation up to its highest point ; in every matter , such as , economically and more .

I believe it is always good to take a risk , even if you fall while trying , there has to be something good learned out of it .
It is when we risk that we understand that a fall is juts a steping-stone in our way of success .
And you learn to stand up againg and never give up , and keep on your way .

If you just stick to what you know , no matter how good you are at it , you are going to get stock in a simply way of life and never progres up rather than to risk a bit and get more instead .

A good risker always make sure to get the most out of a fall .
Feeling confident of yourself at all time is also helpful when taking a risk , keeping in mind `` I can do it '' would help you get what you want easily .
You also know what are you best at , so just take a little risk and improve your knowledge way farther .
A risk does n't have to be consider as a problem or something bad , it could also be a chance , an oportunity to prove yourself that you are up to higher challenges and that you can acomplish what you want ; that there is not limits for someone
