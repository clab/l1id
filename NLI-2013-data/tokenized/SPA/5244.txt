The Informer story

I agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons , first , i work in advertising and second understand about how people perception of products its affected by advertising .

Because i work for an advertising agency i know that we develope advertising campaings that make the products more appealing to the consumers so the fell more attracted to buy them .
I also know that some products had not special benefits but thanks to advertising we create a new world around them so people see the products as a new ones or improved .

The second reason its because we , in advertising know how to affect peoples perception of a product .
So we use advertising to change this perception allways trying to create the ilussion that the product its better than it really is , so people go right away and buy it .

There are regulations among comercial comunications that keep advertisers to tell lies about products or its benefits , so its in our hands to create the new reality of the broduct without telling lies , and that is crativity .

In conclusion advertising makes better look products but without making them a liers .
everything depends on consumer perception .
