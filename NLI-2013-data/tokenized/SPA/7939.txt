The best way to explore a city or a hole country is with a good group of people and an excelent tour guide .
City knowledge , fun and respect are well related with this statement .

When you first travel to a new country it is important to find someone that can take you to the places that you can not miss in your trip .
Eventhough you can get some knowledge from books and Internet about the cities and important places , tour guides give you the exact information you need to know such as theorical facts but also myths , leyends and beliefs , which many times are more interesting and not found in books .

Besides city knowledge , traveling with a goup of people is a very interesting activity because you get to know new persons with different characteristics which help you understand different cultures , attitudes and ways of thinking .
For example , the first time I traveled to Europe I did it with a big group of people , although they were all mexicans I realized there are a lot of different customes in my own country .
It was a great experience because it encouraged new friendships .

Finally , respect is a value well-related with this kind of trips .
Time is an important aspect .
A lot of times we do not think about people 's time , but in this kind of trip everyone depends in the other so punctuallity is a very important topic .
There I understood an excellent frase from an argentian economist named David Konsevic : `` Never take people 's time , when you do this you are taking part of their lives '' .
Not only time but also respect for people 's beliefs and customes which in many cases are different from ours and some times hard to understand .

In conclusion , by experience I can support the statement which mentions that traveling with a group led by a tour guide is best way to do this activity because of better city knowledge , fun and learning to respect people 's time and beliefs .
