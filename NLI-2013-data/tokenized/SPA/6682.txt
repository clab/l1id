In twenty years a lot of things can happen , we can use cars more or fewer than nowadays .
But if a have to choose I will say that in twenty years we will use less cars than today .

I would support this answer by saying that in some years we will see some consequences of our irresponsable actions towards the enviroment so this could be usefull as a warning that will help people to be more consciense and careful with their actions .

For example today we are confronting some of this consequences .
Such as pollution of the air , water , soil , etc , .
We are getting many disease , cancer , intoxication also we are finishing with a lot of species and every species has a porpuse or a roll in the circle of life so we are desorganizing it .
A good example is the problem with deforestation that we have , trees are leathel because they gives as oxigen and many different things and with out them the circle of oxigen will miss a basic component .

In addition in twenty years technology will be more advanced so it would be more responsable .
There will be more facilities for public transport .
Public transport is a good solution because we save time by moving a lot of people at the same time , we save money an gas that both are really important and also is less pollution because are fewer cars .
Lets put Mexico City as an example , it has 22 million people as population and most of the have cars and a lot have more than one per family , imagine the traffic that they generate this will be follow by a huge waste of time and gas , so in conlusion by using public transport we will save all this problems .
