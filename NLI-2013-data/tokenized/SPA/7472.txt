When you are visitng a new country for first times , it 's usual that you do n't know the principal and interesting touristic points , even in citys like Paris , where are places like the Eiffel Tower and The Louvre Museum , there 's differentes places to visit and know .
In this case , I think that the best way to travel is un a group led by a tour guide .

First of all , a tour guide knows the whole city , and He/She can tell us a lot o interesting information of the places tha we are going to visit , for example , in the winter of last year , I went to Canada with my family , it was the first time , and we traveled in a group with a tour guide .
When we were in Quebec , Joan ( the guide 's name ) , took us to a place in where we can walk in the snow for a long time ( it was a hughe forest ) , and we can travel withs dogs , like the skimals in the North Pole .
That kind of places are n't known by common or foreign people , and we cant share and enjoy that new experience with the whole group .

In other words , theres a lot of advantages traveling with a tour guide , another example , last week i went to Acapulco Beach , in Mexico , i love that place , i know `` all '' the interest places , restaurants , bars , popular beaches , because i travel to Acapluco since i was a kid .
but , two days ago , i was talking with my friend 's sister , who is a tour guide , and when i was talking about my travel to Acapulco , and talking about those interests places , she asked to me about `` Laguna de Chacagua '' , Chacaguas Lagoon in english , and `` Barra Vieja Beach '' , and a few more places , i was surprised because i know Acapulco very well , but y did't heard about that places ever .
And I said to her tha i would like to know that part of hidden Acapulco .

For that reasons , i think that travel with a Group led by a Tour guide is the best option for new places and known places .
