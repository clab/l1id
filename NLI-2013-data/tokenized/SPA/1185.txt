I do agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knoeledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
because of differents reasons .
Firts , I believe that it is nice to be able to talk about differents kinds of themes .
For example , I would love to have the opportiunnity to debate about economic problems with a person and discuss world history at the same moment with another person , such as it could be a dinner with friends .

Also I believed it is better to have and idea about differents aspects of life because it shows what is important for a person in their lifes .
The idea of be interested in a variety of stuff for me is a way to demostrate that he or she is a culture person who wants to learn more and more about life .

Besides , that is a statement that I have been debateing with myself lately becacuse I am at one step to enter to the university , and I had to choose whether a carrier that contains knowledge of many sbujects , such as International Relationshiops ( I. R ) , or to choose one with more specific information .
Since I like to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I decided to follow the I. R carrier .

In conclusion I prefer to have knowledge of differents aspects beacuse i have the strong believing that it is important to be informed about almost everything .
In addition to that , i think that with this kind of knowledge , society personal 's image of a person is gonig to be better and more interesting .
Finally it is the kind of knowledge that I considere appropiet for the university carrier that I had decided to follow .
