The application of the knowlegde and skills of a future professional decide the relevance to understand ideas and concepts or to learn specifically facts .

I aggre with the concept that one student need to understand the idea and the concept of a specific topic in a knowledge procedure .
It need to be the beggining to develop a task .

Actually , the education in different countries is based only in the ability that one person has to select practical alternatives looking for give problems solutions .
When the problem can not be solved with the different options suggested , it could present in the person a disability to understand the magnitude of the situation and to generate a new alternative .

To learn fundamental ideas and concepts offer at the professional , the capacity to review and find an alternative way for a solution .
When an individual apply works with mechanical procedures without learn the fundament of them , he will not be able to find , control and correct mistakes in an anormal condition .
For example , when a person who works as technician , with a basical formation only in the development of procedures in field to determine soil or water samples , will be not able to determine what is the real importance to take and manage this samples with a specific protocol .
In the other hand , is he has a conceptualization of his work empahsized in the relevance to generate a quality results , the technician will not work in a `` mechanically '' form .

Unfortunately , the apprenticement of facts looking for practical , fast and short decision is actually expanding in the normal education systems , where the education orient students to know the answer for a question that he needs to select from a test of multiple selection not paying attentio to the mistakes is more important than the formation of a person who need to analyse the fundament for that answer .
