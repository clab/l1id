When you are a student , there are many different ways in which you plan your studying or , in the other hand , the way your teachers or professors help you to do it .
I believe that when you are a teacher you must have some points clear when teaching your students and with that I mean that you must understand that is more importan that students understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .
When a student learn concepts , he or she is able to manage general ideas and adapt what he or she have learned to solve or explain some other situations that will come in his future life , when the student learns things simply as a fact , that idea cannot be adapted or foccused to understand or explain other topics .

When the student starts a process of learning there are different forms in which they keep the information they recieve .
The first one is understanding ideas .
They need to understand the general idea of the topic and they must be able to relate it to common daily things .

Understanding ideas will help the student to work with the principal idea of the topic , it will help him to see the main point and will help the student define in an accurate manner the caracteristics of it , that means , he will be able to give a concept .
When we talk about an specific topic some times is very difficult for the students to express what they are thinking , you can have the idea but you cannot transmit it to other people .

If a student learns only facts , probably those facts are unique , that learning will only be useful in that specific situaction , you cannot generalize , so de student will not be able to use that knowledge in order to solve any other problem .

What is necessary for the students is to catch the precise information , that means , to get the concept clear , to understand the main idea and over all , the student must be able to transmit that knowledge to other people .
That is why is very important that they understand ideas and concepts .
When a student is capable of transmiting the information he learned ( ideas and concepts ) to other people we can say that he really learned what we expected .
