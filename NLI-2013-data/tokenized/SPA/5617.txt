It is understood that the purpose of advertisements is to attract the publics attention in many possible ways .
These could be by using extravagant colours , catchy slogans , songs and nowadays even special effects are sometimes included .
Catching the `` eye '' is only the first step , the advertisement 's job is also to give the best possible image of the product being showed .
Sometimes the overuse of misusage of technologies , such as special effects or words in the advertisement might lead to cause false impressions on the public .
I definetly think though that this situation is rarely seen .
Advertisements today make products seem `` cooler '' in order to atract attention , but in retrospective the product seen is the same one you might purchase later at the store .

It would be very difficult for this statement to become a reality nowadays .
Several consumer rights laws prevent that companies or corporations give a false impressiong of their products .
What is advertise is usually what you get acoording to the law .
As a consumer you are now entitled to demand the product you were informed of and also any other benefits this product shall provide to you .
For instance lets take a Dr. Pepper ad , it might describe you the taste , the package and the price , that is exactly what you 'll get in the store , the background music and the young actors in the advertisement surely are not included , they are just visual aids .
Another example is a hair growth product or a dieting pill , consumer rights protect you from the possible lies that the corporations may induce in the ad .
At the end of the treatment you might not look exactly like the people showed in the advertisement , but you wil loose weight and grow hair .

In my personal experience I think that advertisements might be more shocking than they used to be , they tend to atract more my attention that a few years ago that 's for sure .
Nevertheless the product that I am offered is always the one I get when I buy it , never better just exaclty what I expected .
