The knowledges are very important in the life , only those anyone cant stolen you because are in your mind , for this knowledges you can improve your development daily in your life , when the time goes on in your life you learn different knowledges from different ways .

In my opinion im agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject the to specialize in one specific subject .
For have broad knowledge of many academy subjects you have to study a lot and paid attention to many things for understand well for specialize in one specific subject you only have to focus in one subject and you may controlate all its derivates .

With knowledge of many academic subjects you can development various jobs because you have knowledges for that , with knowledge of many subjects you are more intelligent person than with one specifct subject because the study of a lot of things develop your capacity for think and for learn more and fast .

The advantages of have knowledges of many subjects are that you can find job in distincs offices and you have more probability to join in one but those things have a disadvantage too because you have to learn very well many things and in specific subject the probability you dont have to learn much bue when you try to find a good with good pay is more difficult but if you have how work and you realize it fine you can find a good pay job .
