Being successful in life is something that we all desire , unluckily only a few ones will manage to get it .
Personally , I think that success depends on many things and not only on taking risks because if you want to be the number one on something , you need to be born with certain skills , give the best of you and to make an important sacrifice .

Some people may agree in saying that being succesful means to break the rules , However you can not break any rule if you do not know how rules work first .
I mean , if you want to be the best at playing soccer , you need to know that there are certain rules that you are suppose to follow , like team work , solidarity , understanding your mates etc .

in this case , to think that you will become the best football player in the world by doing whatever you want and not paying any attention at all to any recomendation is absolutely nonsense .
Obviously , when you behave like this , you are taking a risk , but that risk is ridiculous and naive .

I wholeheartedly believe that if you ever dream of being a successfull man , sometimes you will have to take a risky step , but that step can not be taken without having the previous knowledge about something or withouth being fully aware of the consequences .

The fact that we live in a society that everyday demands more and more , makes us think that if we do not gain sucess we are nothing .
Nevertheless , success is not a matter of being the best at something , but being the best in all these small things that we do in our everyday life .

To conclude , if you want to be successful take risk , but do not let this risk destroy your whole life .
