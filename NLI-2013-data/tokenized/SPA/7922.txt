I think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is safer , the best touristic places are shown , and It can be cheaper .

First of all , traveling alone can be very dangerous since you are in a place that you do n't now .
Some times even the idiom is strange to you .
It 's possible that by mistake you ended up in risky places where you can be assalted .
These are some risks that people like me do n't want to have , so the answer for them is to travel in a tour .
Because tour 's are composed of many people and are led by a local guide who knows the zone , you can be almost sure that nothing bad will happen to you .

Furthermore , lonely travelers have to ask for interesting places in each city they go .
They will visit some places , but probably they will miss others .
When traveling in a tour , all the places are known by the agency , and they usually give you the best of each town .
You dont waste time asking for advice and you do n't miss important places .

Finally , although tour agencies seem to be expensive .
In my opinion , they ended up being cheaper .
When you travel by yourself , you can make some good deals .
Nevertheless , very often people are cheated by local sellers , and they do n't become aware of this because they simply do n't what is the correct prize .
These events never happen in tours .
They know where they work , and the correct prize .
Thay charge you some extra money for this knowledge , but it 's worth it .

Overall , I prefer to travel with tour agencies because an important thing to me is to play safe in my trips along with the fact that I do n't like to miss any interesting spot .
In addition , tour agencies end up being cheaper .
