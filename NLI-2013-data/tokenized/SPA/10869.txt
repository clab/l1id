Sucess is a famous word used in our everyday lives .
Why sucess is so important ?
For me is something we have to figure it out .
You ca n't said for being sucessful you need to be like this or like that , because it depend of our goals or the goals of our society .

I 'm agree when is stablished that `` Sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
I 'm agree with this statement because our life is compound by layers of goals , certainly a person without goals is a person without purpose in life .
People who we describe as sucess is people who take chances , people who is prepare to take their life in their hands and make things possible .
People who we admire is people that tried something new things and got sucess in it .
How we are going to be call sucessfull is always is doing the same thing , and do n't try anything new to applied the characteristic of sucesful , for being sucesfull you need an action before the adjetive .
How could we describe something that does n't happen yet .
It is impossible .
It is like our college live you have to take new classes everytime , but before taking a new class , you need to sucesfully pass the that class that you are taking in the actual moment .
When You pass that class , you can go to the next level , why ?
because you was succesful in the last want .
The term of succesfulness is a term for steps in our life , but for keeping being sucessful we have to try new things in a new level to can be call succesfull again .
I you do the same thing that you already know how to do well , you can be describe as you WAS succesful when you succed and learn how to did that well , but that was in the past , to be sucessful in a present tense you need to do something in which you could succeed .
