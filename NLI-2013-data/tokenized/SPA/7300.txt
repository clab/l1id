Traveling is an oportunity for sharing with people , but mostly to discover wonderful things on land .
If you go with a a group of friends , it turns a really enjoyful experience and if you decide to be guided by tour guide probably you will Know new beautiful places .
However not always the tour guide shows all the places to meet so in that case , is better to try guiding yourself along with your friends .

usually the tour guides have an specific tour and they did not change it so often , also they have specific activities to develop within your group .
So , when you are being guided you must follow all the time the tour guide and you could not explore yourself other wonderful places .

Traveling in group without a tour guide , allows you and your friends to discover by yourselves the wonderful parts that a new place have .
Also , you can surprise with other things you find special , so I consider that it is better to travel in group , therefore enjoying with friends , but you must experience by yourselve at the time yo make a tour with a tour guide .
