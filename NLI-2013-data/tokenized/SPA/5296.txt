I completely agree .
That is the purpose of an advertisement , to try to make things look better than they really are .
Our society is based in capitalism and consumism .
The more you make people buy things ( even the ones they do not need or work as they should ) , more money is made and companies are able to grow and expand .
If a company selling a specific product wants to be profitable and expand , it needs to let everyone know that its product is the best .

Now , if you are trying to sell a product but you just realized it has some flaws , would you tell the custommer about that ?
Most people would n't .
It would imply to invest more money trying to make the product better and capitalism is about making money not expending it .
After all , if a company can make money selling quality products they will do it .

In advertisements , marketing people look at the good points of a product and focus on them , making them look like the best option for the consummer .
Obviously , they wo n't say anything about its disadvantages or problems they will try to make people want to buy that product .

However , that 's why some countries have aggencies to keep track of custommer complainings made about bad products .
If they find there 's a problem with the product they might contact the company responsible for that and make it fix it or do something else in order to compensate the custommer expenses .

I think the important point here is the ethics of the company trying to sell products .
If the company only cares about making more money , they will try to sell low quality products , however if they have good ethics , they 'll try to sell always the best products even if they need to expend more money
