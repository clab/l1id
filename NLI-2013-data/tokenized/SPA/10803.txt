definitely i agree , cauze life is an ever changing challenge , which is shown in many stages as you are growing old , presented itself with new obstacles that mostly come as new things for you , and you will find yourself at decisionmaking circumstance where you have to choose wether yo dare to know and do new things or not ,

based on my own experience and personal thinking , i am taking risks attempting to study abroad , even though i am sure that so far i ve got high quality and knowledge from my university to work in a local ecuadorian society , and i can develop in my sutdy field , but i also think that focusing on a specific issue related to one s studies will make accesible new technology and methods on the conservation of the environment , at the same time the opportunity of developing my skills in the area i ve chosen , will give me the chance to express my ideas and contirbute to improve our society from practical points of view , i also think that i can enrichen even more my knowledge by hearing other perspective from sutdents who were raised under diferent cultural and environmental pattenrs , but regardles of this there will also be things that i will not like too much , i mean shok culture , new currencies , new lifestyles , new architecture and totally a diferent environment .

so if i would not take these risks i would never know if i was able to face new circumstances and even develop my personal skills , and to find out how far i was capable to reach , at such point that it might turn out frustrating and uncomfortable in the future , so as a sum i think the more versatile you can be the better , let alone the possibility of distressing yourself , for example with activities involved in art such as music and painting , or making tours , cooking , learning languages , working in farms , etc
