What is the best way to travel ?
Although some people prefer to travel by themselves without any tour guide , I particular prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide because it offers various advantages such visting famous places , making new friends and save time .

First , traveling in a group led by a tour guide takes people to famous places .
For example , if I go to Paris in this way , I will visit the most important places in the city .
I might know the best of Paris .
On the other hand , if I go by myself , I need to use a map and learn about the tourist places .
In this way , I might miss important places .

Moreover , traveling in group by a tour guide gives the chance to make friends .
This type of trips are usually in groups of 20 or 30 people .
If I go with this group , I meet people of different countries and cultures .
I can also meet people of different ages .
Then I can keep in contact with them after the trip .

Finally , going on a trip in group led by a tour guide help people to save time .
People will go straight to main places without getting lost .
Consequently , people will not waste time trying to get to a place because they will be guide by an expert of the area .
For example , if want to visit the best places in Boston , I can just trust and follow the tour guide because he knows very well the places and the area better than me .
In this way , I can plan to visit the most interesting places in Boston in a short time because someone will guide me .

To sum up , I think that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide due to the benefits it gives me .
These are the opportunity to visit the best places in a town , city , or country , the chance to make new friends and the advantage of save time .
In this way , people can have more fun on a trip .
