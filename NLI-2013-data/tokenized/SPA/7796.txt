Traveling by group is an exciting experience due to you can meet new people apart from meeting the plac that is being visited , in my case I agree this statement because 3 years ago I had the oportunity to travel with a group of girls from my same age , and it just was an experience that i will never forget , meeting people of different places , is quite nice , but it is better to enjoy a trip or a certain place with another people , being led by a guide is very important when do you really whant to know about a place , its culture , its people , and this kind of things , it also is interesting to visit places that are only known by this kind of people .
Its very enjoyable having a person who can answr to all of the doubts or questions that that you have about certain places , things , culture or history of the city or country that is being visited .
If the porpouse of your trip is of getting relax and get appart from people , it is better to take that trip alone , ad to discover and solve the doubts about the place alone , due to is tru that for reflexing and having peace there is nothing better than being alone , or with your family , without strange people .

In my personal opinion i prefer to travel by group meeting people and being led by a tour guide , which can solve my doubts and can teach me more about the place , can give me an advice about what can be done or what can ot be done in that place , which restaurant is better and so on , also when im going in a relaxing plan with my family or alone it is better to being led by a guide because of tha same reason that I expesed before .
The better advice that can be done to a traveler is to enjoy the trip alone or in goroup , being led by a guide or not , there is nothing better than meeting new places and new cultures , due that kind of experiences are printed on memory during long time .
