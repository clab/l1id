Nowadays , the used of cars is widely spread aroud the world .
Never the less , it is differently distributed depending on the caracteristic of the coutries , and on the level of development .

Some governments are trying to desentivate the use of cars because of pollution , and even to precent accidents .
In addition , some people are looking for other kinds of less expensive ways of transportation , taking into account the increase of oil prizes .

It is very hard to say though , that these governmental and particular initiatives are going to be the same in all the countries and that are going to have the same consequences .

In Europe , with small countries , where there is not enough space , where the cities are crowded and very near to other one , it is relatevily easy to make public policy to decentivate the use of cars .
Indeed sinde the 70's , after the first oil boom , the use of cars , or big cars have decreased .
Governmets promote the use of trains and subways on the main cities .
The space and parking problem in the biggest cities is another reason why people can prefer more are more to use public transportation rather than cars .
In Europe , it is very common to see more and more during the warm seasons the use to bicycles not only to go to college , but also to go to work .
And governments incetivating these kinds of solutions by building bicycles roads .

On the other hand , in places sucn as the United States where the biggest part of the cities are widespread on a several number of kilometers despite their small size , it could be very hard to desincentivate the use of cars even with public policies .

Indeed , only big metropoles such as New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , could easily respond to policies such as those made in Europe .
The traffic is soo messy , and the space so reduce , that in twenty years it would be natural to use fewer cars .
However , in smaller and spred cities , the use of cars is essential .
They do n't face the same problems of space , parking , and pollution of the big metropoles .
Their problem is more about distance , and about oil .

One fact that could really reduce then the number of cars in those places is to face oil scarce and therefore a huge prize raising .
And facing this problem , public policy could be not enough to solve the problem , since those cities are made to ride on a car .

To summarize The use of cars in twenty years can be very different depending on the economic situation of the worl in that moment and on the oil prizes .
