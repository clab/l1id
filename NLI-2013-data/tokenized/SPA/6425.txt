The statement expressed is one thing people and particularly all researchers of mobility would like to know .
From the first car appeared in our lives , their quantity has not stopped of increase .
So , which will be the future for the car ?

Nowadays car is an important part of our life .
We use it for everything because everything is easier with it .
On average a normal citizen could move around 20 kms per day with his car to go to work , shopping or whatever .
That 's seems is going to be the most predictable future thanks to be the most comfortable way of living .

However there is something that grows at the same pattern as cars : traffic .
A lot of researchers say that traffic is the disease of the actual cities .
When it appears is nearly impossible to control it .
This is something that goes against cars because when people last double time to do the same route , one question start to appear : Do I have other method of transport ?

In fact our society have a variety of transports we had never imagined , but they are not so easy-going as cars are .
Although it is proved that they are faster and cheaper than our cars , people do not like them .
Statements like bus is crowded , I have to walk a lot to the train station ...
are very common and set public transport behind cars , except when they do not depend on traffic jams and allow people sleep some minutes more before going to work .

Environment is another thing we have to take care .
Kyoto protocol is clear in that aspect : the most production of greenhouse effect gasses is caused by private transport .
So it is not so difficult than in a 20 years time cars would be banned from downtown , like in London happends at this moment .

As a conclusion predictions about cars are difficult to state .
Everything depends on human behaviour , environmental consciense and political response .
Who could imagine a world without cars ?
Me !
