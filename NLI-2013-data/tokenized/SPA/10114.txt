Successful people use to take risk in the projects that they are involved in .
In my own opinion , these people are success because they innovate , they are not scare of the risk and they are confident in their posibilities .
I believe that these three personal features are requiered to be a talent and succesful person nowadays .

Firstly , innovating is necessary to achieve better results .
If you prove always the same thing in the same manner you will obtain the same result .
Innovation could give you a new way of doing thinks .
For that reason , I support that those people who innovate could be closer to successed than those who do not .

Secondly , to be a risky person means not be scare about the future .
From my point of view those who are not afraid about the future bad consequences of their actions have more time to concentrate in their actions .
Therefore , think more in how to progress and inprove their day to day life than in regreating about what they did in the past .

Third , be confident is a very important personal characteristic .
Because , those who have a winner opinion their believe in their possibilities .
In addition , this kind of people dares to perform whatever they have planned .
So , they do in an optimistic way .

To sum up , successful people have the combination of these three personal qualities .
The strong point of their achievements is do not do the things that already know that works .
These people innovates , risk and prove themselves that they can do it better .
