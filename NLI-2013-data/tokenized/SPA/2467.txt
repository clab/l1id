The world is full of people with a wild range of different personalities , different experiences , and even more diffrent ways of seing life .
Some people enjoy life more than others , but it does not depend on the age of the body .
Therefore , I truly disagree with the statement that says `` Young people enjoy life more than older peolple do '' .

Each age has its own magic , and in every step of our lives we learn and develop abilities that help us to enjoy the time we are living .
For example , when a young child begins to communicate with his or her mother by the use of words , probably feels really proud of it , and enjoy it .
The same happens when a baby starts playing with toys , or a kid learns to read .
This fact can be applyed to adults when they reach their first academic degree or when they get married .

Furthermore , every person has its personal way of enjoying the things he or she does , in addition to a unique form of expressing how he or she feels .
For instance , two humans being can experiment the same situation at different periods of their lives , react to it in a very different way , but enjoy it similarly .

Other fact that is important to have in mind is the concept of joing .
It should vary from one person to another , besides the fact that a person can be having pleasure when other understands that the first one is suffering .
As an illustration , I will state the imagen of a person crying , I can infer that something bad has happened to the person , nevertheless he or she can be crying of happiness .

In conclusion , I believe that each person enjoys life in his or her own way , and would like to add that will be very helpful for humanity to stop looking at situations from a personal perspective and try to understand that each person lives as he or she wants and not to compare between them .
