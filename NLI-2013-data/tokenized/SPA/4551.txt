I 'm agree with this statement , first of all , i think this is a result of the globalization of the economy , that push some industries to compete in a market place and as a result we see advertisements that shows some products better than they really are .
I 'm not again the globalization but i believe that , as it is positive in some ways but also has a negative side .

The advertisements we see on this days , show products like food , clothes and electronic devices in a better way they really are .
Its very comon on the food industry where constantly we see in TV comecials , and posters on the steet , that some restaurant show they products bigger than they really are , also we can see a pair of tennis shoes that can give you the ability of jump higher that any pair of shoes in the market , and when you finally wear the shoes you see you just make the same performance .

There are professional staff dedicated to emphatize the caracteristic of a product line , and one of the common rules is to show the products in a very atractive scenario , like the car in a road besides the sea , or the same car in the mountains with a spectacular view and a famous model behind the wheel .

I think that globalization has some responsability on this , but not all the responsability , because even before people start to talk about globalization this used to happened in a lower scale .

There are other factor that will have to be consider , like the media , the industry and the culture of the country .
I will not defintly blame a single factor , i believe that there are a lot of factor why advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
