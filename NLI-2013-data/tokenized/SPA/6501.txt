I cannot imagine the world with fewer cars in use than there are today .
If you think coldly , the cars manufacturing market is strong and powerful , where thousand of people around the world work thanks to the Automobile field .
I could mention several answer to analyce that it could be impossible to do it .
Aspects such as unemployment effects , decreasing the economy , aspects concerning poblation , or improving the technology , will be the reasons to not permit that in the future will be fewer cars that there are today .

Firstly , one of the causes that I do not agree with this statement is because , the poblation is increasing in huge paths .
Families have more children than years ago , so in the short time of future , the new generations will need more cars and automobiles to drive to school , back to work or going vacations .

Secondly , as a businessman , and concretely as a salescar , I do not agree with this question beacuse , my compay will laid off me , and could be great quantity of co/workers as like out of the office .
This reduction of employers would be an absolutly brankcroupt at the cars business .
Everyone knows , that nowadadays , that cars conmpanies such aToyota , BMW , or Mercedes are doing a good job researches new fuels and other system of managing .
Technology is going fast so we need students to work in investigations researches to maintain the use of cars .

In conclusion , in my view threre are several aspects to trust that in the twenty years there will be the same cars or more than now .
The car world business hire a lot of people around the world , from the person who design prototype 's until the salesman like me .
Also , the number of poblation each day is in continuining expansion , so everybody needs car to go to differents places , and of course , techonolgy will offer new types to manage the news car .
Please , If disapear the benefits in sales in cars , I will be an unemploy .
