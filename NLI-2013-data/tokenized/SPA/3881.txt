Have you noticed how crowded of young people shops are at anytime in the cities ?
Young people nowadays loved to have more and more things and spend much of their time on this without considering the needs that our community have .
In my opinion young people behavior seems to me selfish and not helpful with the community .

First of all , capitalistic society we are living contribute young people to consume .
For example , the ads on televison help to create expectative of having things and consume more .
Furthermore , shops everywhere make citizien feel confortable because we know we can have what we need just going shoping .
What I mean is that is not possible to think in enjoyable things all the time , youth needs to consider other aspects .

Regarding to this , we can be helpful at the same time we enjoy as we do shoping .
We can reach this aim for example helping beggars recolecting money in groups along the streets .
For instance we can have a chat with old people who are on their own sitting in a bench on the park , just to make them have a good time .

In short , considering young people do n't help too much the community what I suggest is that we can help the community we are living and at the same time have a great time doing simple things .
