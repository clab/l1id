I am totally agree with this statement , I think that always the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and this is because that is the intention of the advertisements .

An advertisement of a product is created to make people to buy the product , so it must show that the product is the best product that you can buy among others products .

In this way , if an advertisement of a product does not make the product to seem a good product , it is not a good advertisement .
On the other hand , an advertisement must tell the true about the product that it is trying to sell .
If for example an advertisement of an mp3 player says that the devices have 512 Mb of capacity and it actually have only 256 Mb the advertisement is lieing about the features of the device and this is against the law .

So , what I want to say is that I agree with the statement but only if it referes to advertisements that not lie about the characteristics of the product .
I think that is totally correct to do an advertisement that make the product seem much better than it really is but always if this is make by telling the true to the potencial customers .

An other examples of advertisements that always make the product seem better than it really is , are the ones of food .
When you go to a restaurant they show you pictures a plate and you look at it and you feel that it is really taste and that you are going to enjoy it very much , but then when you buy the plate you realized that it was not that taste .

To conclude , I think that nowadays television and internet is full of advertisements thar make products seem much better than they really are , but it is not a bad thing because that is why the advertisements are for
