We have all different lives and different ways on living it and different expactations , goals and dreams .
But how does a person enjoy life better than another ?
how could the enjoyment of life be mesured ?
Do young people enjoy life better than older ones ?
It all depends on the way we look at life and on the definition we give to the word ` enjoy ' .
But it is also a matter of cultures , for some cultures praise the older over the younger people of their society and the other way around .

If enjoying life means doing everything possible to feal alive we can say younger people enjoy life better .
Younger people party , stay up late , travel , do not make plans for the future , study and are in constant discovery of the world .
In one word the are living under the '' carpe diem '' philosophy .
Live every day to the fullest state these latin words and young people are the symbol of this ancient wisdom .
Young people are counted for disturbing the law and the rules of society and for imagining other possible ways of living .
The disorganized , irresponsable , spontanious and crazy way young people pursute their lives states they enjoy it better than older people if we take the word ` enjoy ' as doing everything to feel alive .

Nonetheless , if we take a different meaning to the word ` enjoy ' and define it as doing everything to stay alive and to tresure life we can say it is the older people that enjoy life better and I would have to disagree with the statement .
Older people are wiser and they have lived longer .
They have lived all the nonesense of youth and are like a walking library .
In fact , in some tribes in Africa when an elderly person dies he or she is morned longer than if a younger person died because he or she was considered as a key part of the tribe as a part of the tribe 's wisdom and knowledge that has sleeped away forever .
Older people enjoy life better because they cherish life more and because they are wiser than young people , they know where they are from and where are they headed to , they value life and do everything to treasure and preserve it .

To enjoy life is as much a personal thing as to be fond of chocolate or not .
Young people as well as older people enjoy life in one way or another and in my opinion the ` enjoyment ' of life cannot be mesured and most importantly cannot be compared .
So I do not know if young people enjoy life better than older people the only thing I know and I hope for is that everybody enjoys life as much as they can while they still can .
