As a journalism student , I think that it 's more important learn the facts than anything else , so i 'm totally disagree with the statement .
I ca n't understand how can be possible that you can learn and appreciate more the ideas or the concepts than the fact itself .

You do n't think is better evaluate and re-evaluate the fact and then establish your own ideas ?
In my opinion , learning concepts and ideas , is learning what other people learned about the fact .
Using others as a referencial group is n't bad or wrong .
But the point is that learning facts makes you responsable for whatever you learned .
In other words you just did n't follow anothers opinions , anothers concepts or ideas .
You create your owns , and if they 're wrong , then YOU evaluate your own concepts or ideas .

Precisely , is more objective the fact itself .
Think of this : if you learned first the idea or concept , in some way you already know something and just stay in that line , but if you go directly to the fact you can have your own knowledge ...
Created by you .
