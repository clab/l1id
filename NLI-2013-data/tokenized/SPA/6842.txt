While there are things that can suggest this can actually happen , I dont consider the idea of having less cars than there are today in twenty years very possible .
There are various reasons why I consider this to be very hard .
The first reason why I consider this not to be easily achieved is the rapid population growth we are going through .

Population has been increasing rapidly over the years , even though in many developed nations population rates are either staying the same or reducing , in developing nations such as India , China and many other the history is very different , population grows everyday .
Even though governments are trying to stop this by taking drastic measures , these will take time and by then more and more cars will be needed and produced .

Another reason why I consider this to be something that can hardly happen is due to the fact that developed nations have people with extreme amount of money .
Even though this people may need one car or two they will purchase a ridiculous amount of cars .

Technology is something that is advancing every day .
Before car companies needed a large amount of people and time to produce one car , now with the help of technology millions of cars are produced every day , in some procedures humans are not even involved .
This suggests that cars are being made at a more rapid rate and many more cars are being sold everyday all around the world .

As I mentioned before there are some points which are very important to these discussion .
Oil is so expensive now that even though many people can afford a car not all of them can afford gas , therefore this could support the idea of less cars being made .

I sincerely bellieve that having less cars in 20 years is very hard but there are points which suggest the opposite , therefore i can only hope and wait to see what actually happens .
