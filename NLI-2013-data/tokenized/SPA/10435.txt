It often happens in a community , for example in a work place .
there are some people who are escential to the company because of their performance , they are really good at what they do and their performance is exelent , but when it come to the moment of making someone the chief of the department the person that gets it is the one that 's willing to take risks , he thinks outside the box and comes up with new ideas .
Even though the other employe may be more skilled to do the operations , a company needs someone that has inovations and that can bring the company to a higher level .

In history the people that we remember , are those who were took risks and did something out of the ordinary using their abillities and skills .
They were already good artists or maybe good thinkers , like physicians or philosopher , but what made them succed in life is that they tried new things .
