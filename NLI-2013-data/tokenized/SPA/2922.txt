I would have to say that I agree with the statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and here is why :
When you are young ( I would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have less commitments and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit .
Please allow me to explain my ideas with some examples .

When I mean you have more energy to go aroung , I am talking about vitality and being in shape , it would not be as easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenties , when your body is tone and strong .
than when your are in your fifties even if you stay in shape , there is always the risk of a heart attack or other conditions that normally appear with age .
And things that seemed okey before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now .

As for the commitments and responsabilites , I gravitate towards family and work .
To me these two are the center of my life .
I could not do the things I did in my twenties now that I have a family to support and I am tied with a mortgage and credit card bills .
So I guess I would call this the `` settled life factor '' , which could be pretty tight in both spheres but more manageable when young .

Finally , I belive that when you are young , you are more willing to take risks , go for adventures and take chances as you go .
As people mature they some how change their ways , and settle for something secure which I would translate into a calm life , with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be `` used '' during vacation times , maybe once a year .
And as I have heard people say : If I did n't do that when I was young I do n't think I could do it now .
