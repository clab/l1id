I totally agree with the statement , the best way to to have a nice travel is to go in a group and also to have a good tour guide .
When we think about the possibility to do a travel we have to consider differents aspects one of those is the place where we want to go , also if it is good to be alone or in group and also , what we want to do on that place and how to do it .

First , went we choose a place of dentination we have to consider aspects like the time that we have .
When we do a travel in a group all the activities are very coordinated .
The travel led by a tour are the best idea when you want to know a new place .

The tour guide is the person specialides on this kind of jobs because they have the knowledge of the place that you want to visit , that have a clear understanding of the history of that place , also the right places to visit , what to eat and what to buy as a souvenir .
they give a comprehensive tour for that place that you want to know completly .

For example the last weekend i went to Mexico with a goup of frients and we have just few days to enjoy the new country and also to have contact with the city and the people .
So the best ideas was to take a tour by the city with a specilized person , The city was Guanajuato , and this place of the country has a rich history to meet .
That tourist guide really know about the city .
He explained about the historica aspects of this city , we went to the target places to the city and also we took the most beautiful picture in the especial places , because of his orientation .
It was an amazing travel , and we did that travel in just one day ; Definilly to hire that person was the best ideas because in other way we could not see all that we did .
I met to the mommis , the callejon of the kiss , the statu of the pipila , and more .

So in my personal opinion and depending on which plan you travel the best idea is to go in a group because you can reduce costs on your travel , you have the opportunity to meet new people , and you enjoy more also the tour guide is an important key to get a complete knowledge of the new place .

Depening of what kind of person you are , you choose the sort of travel that you want to do but the most important thing is to enjoy the new experience .
