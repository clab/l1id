I deeply agree that undestanding ideas is very much decisive than learning facts .
It means that you understand the general concept of a situation instead of a little step in the middle of it .
In other words , it is just like , what do you prefer ?
To take a great view of the horizon from the peak of a mountain or simply from the ground .

First , it is important to teach this kind of statement when we are kids .
We are starting to learn and understand .
We are facing a new process which has nothing from early periods in life .
There is no rock in the way .
As soon we understand this pattern of behaviour , we will put that into practice .

Furthermore , once you are used to apply that teaching , you will see things clearer .
For example , you do not need to sit in the middle of the problem in order to solve it .
Step backwards , get a huge view of the problem from different angles and , now , try to face it .
We tend to base on our experience to behave in this way .
But , it is much better if we learn it as a child .

Another important thing associated with learning only facts is that we still have to climb up a whole mountain in order to reach the idea .
Ideas are high up there and we will not undestand how a clock works or a plain flights if we just merely think about facts .
It is up where the whole knowledge is located .

Again , there is always the highest point in the city .
Say , a skycraper .
Go there , climb up from the very beginning , start to see advantages and disadvantages and once you get up there you will solve the whole problem .
Life will be much easier this way .
