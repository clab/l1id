It can not be made a true statement that young people enjoy lide more than older people do .
Everyone enjoys life in a different way .
Yet , it is true that young people have more energy and willingness to do new things and experiment , that does not mean that they enjoy life more than older people do .
it all depends on one 's view of life , and how is is going to be enjoyed .

For some people enjoying life can be lay doing in the grass in the middle of a forest and observe the sky for the whole day .
However , for other people that could be considered be considered as a boring and even an annoying thing to do ; they would rather go and play soccer .
everything depends on what one likes and one 's view of what enjoying life is .

It is true that young people have less experience and much more energy and wish to do and experiment new things in life , and enjoy experimenting new sensations ; the experience that a mature adult has lets him make it 's own prototipe of what a enjoyable life is like .
Young people are always learning new things and learning comes from experimenting and experiencing new things .
Young people are often considered risky too , since they do n't know much about life and have not matured completely yet ; they enjoy taking risks in life and assuming the consequences is the part that most of the young people do n't like .

From my personal experience i can say that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
When i lived with my dad i remember that me and my dad used to spend a lot of time together and he always had just as much fun as i did , or even more .
And i did n't find quite enjoyable to go out with my dad , however , he did ; everything is about tastes and the way you see life .
If you enjoy life reading , somebody else might find reading boring and he would play football instead .
