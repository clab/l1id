The statment shown uses a perspective which shows that most products display the beasr features an item should have , so when the items displays a lesser capacity , the client that purchesed the item has complaints about it and complains with both the company he bought it from along with the advertizement which influenced the purchess .

This is not the way it should be , since the only objective of an advertisement has is to make the connection between the client and the seller .
What happens in an advertisement process is : A seller comes to the advertisement agency and hires the agensy to communicate a new product on the market .
the Agency then takes a look at the product and makes an analisis on which demografic is most sutible to benefit fron this pruduct , the agency then makes an advertisment campaign that best suits the product and releasesit to the apropiate media .
This is what people see when discussing advertizement and categorize it as a form of manipulation , but bare in mind , no advertizment forces a customet to purches a product .
No one forces a customer out of ther homes and thretens to kill their children if they dont buy the pruduct .
They just display the item and tel people what it dose in a way the client might understand .

If an item does not live up to the expectation the client had of it , its simply because the client expected too much out of the item .
The ad agency is not responsible for a clients expectations .
theyr only obligation is to simply take the information the sellers give them and use that information to represent the product .

To sumarize this , Ad Agencies only reflect the informat a seller provides about an product , and the client is the one responsible of deciding if the product suts their need .
Defects and other such problems should go directly to either the theller or manufactorer of said product .
