Students have a number of ways to learn nowadays .
Personally , it is much better when I study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea .
I believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than fact is the best way to suceed .
Learning facts are very hard keep becasue you could forget them over time , Understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments , And finally students skills could be enhance .

It could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example .
They could help you answer the questions of your test of history .
But you could forget it after few days .
While understanding the concepts could help for a long time .
For example , understanding why the a battle started , what were the conditions after the battle finished , and son on .
It could be in your brain longer than learning facts .

Undestanding concept could be valuable when you are studying a different topic .
For example , the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict .
On the other hand , if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even , maybe you have to study againg for your business or your geography class .

Students could develop better skills if the learn concepts and ideas .
They could argue for example , why the battle happened , or even learn that war conflict are not the best way to thrive .
They could even interested and pursue a carer in history .
I think Learning concepts and ideas from a topic , give you many opportunities fot your future life .

For all these reason , I support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather that facts .
It imprive their skills , help them to other subjects and enhance their skills .
