Althoug older people enjoy life , there are some facts that make young people to enjoy life more than an older person does .
In my opinion , young people are healthier than older people .
Also , they can learn faster because their brains are more active .
Furthermore , young people enjoy taking risk , while older people seems to be more conservative .

First , helth is a big issue when we talk about enjoying life .
If our body is in a good condition , we can study , work , dance , play or even eat los of different kind of food .
Young people should care about what they eat but they still can eat different food without feel bad .
In adition , when a young person is healthy , he can practices sports even if they offer some risk .
For example , soccer or gymnastic require skills and lot of movements with our body .
Probably a older person cannot practices these activities if he is not healthy at all .

Second , learning faster is a procces that is affacted with the age .
Some researches have demostrated that young brains learn easier than older brains .
This fact remark the difference in the procces when we are learning .
For example .
My daugther is 5 years old and she actually speaks three lenguages very good .
My father is trying to learn English as a second lenguage but his process is very slow compared with my daugther 's learning process .

Third , another advantage when a person in young , is the abilitty of taking risk .
Young people love to take a chance even if this chance can finish in advantage or disadvantage for them .
They usully planning less than older people does .
For example , if a position for a job is availeble for a person in Australia but he lives in South America , the young person probably will accept the position as soon as he has the opportunity , while an older person will think longer about that .

In conclusion , younger people always have more opportunities to enjoy their lives than
