It is possible to use fewer cars than we use today ?
Can we stop ussing the car ?
There are two different answers for these questions , yes or no .
In one hand we can say that in twenty years we will use less the car because it will come a day in which every road , every city and every country will be colapsed because of the cars .
It will be so full of cars that I am sure that the air will be black because of the polution .
There are more causes that we can say that argue this idea , cars consume a lot of petrol and petrol is not eternal , so they we have to invent new car models without the necesity of using petrol .
I am sure that they will invent them but not in twenty years now .

In the other hand we have that we will use more cars than the ones we use now , Could this be possible ?
Yes .
Nowadays the media is to have more than one car for each person , something really hard to believe , because , how wants more than one car ?
I do not know but it is the truth .
If we still buying more than one car , or if we buy only one car for each person , definately , in twenty years we will use more cars than we do today .

I have to say that I fell like fear if I start to think this because we could not go anywhere anyway , I mean , there will be so many cars that we could not go by car because it will bw colapsed , and we could not go walking because it will be poluted , so What can we do ?

The main problem is that we have not got any solution .
We cannot oblige anybody not to go by car and go walking , but we can try to use the car as less as possible , for example , going four only in one car instead of going in four cars or something like that .

To conclude , I have to said that we have to find solutions to this problem if we want to live in a place with pure air and without a lot of noise and accidents , using less the car will cause less accidents .
