This statement is true and false .
First of all , when there is a lot of people traveling toguether it may be better to travel with a tour guide , because is difficult for many pepple traveling toguether to maintain an order , and they can get lost , or they may disagree of certain places to go .
Traveling with a group can result in many problems and a lot of difficulties during the travel , so the best way to manage that is by having a tour guide .

I think in my personal opinion that the best way is to travel alone .
The person traveling alone can collect information from internet , magazines or books , and go to that strange country by her | himself , and do the best he | she can to visit the best and most wonderfull places in that country and experience for her | himself .

Its true that the tour guide is more experienced in visiting the place you dont know , but people learn better when they have to figure out things by themselfs .
For example , when you go to a museum , before you go , if you are alone , you need to investigate about it , and learn about it and things of that nature , so you can confirm that this museum is a good place for you to visit .
In the contrary , when someone is in a group led by a tour guide , there are a lot of distractions , because of the quantity of people in the group , and is more difficult to pay attention or to look at pictures for example in a museum , when there is a lot of people following a tour guide .

Another important thing is that when you are in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow that group where they go , instead of going where you wish to go , and where your feelings take you .
For me being in a vacation is doing whatever you want and whenever you want to do it , so being with a tour guide is like being in a school trip , and you cant do what you wish to do .

Tour guides are perfect for school trips or things of that nature , because kids need to follow someone .
