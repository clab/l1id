The role of a student is learn as much as possible from olders ideas to create is own ones .
Then he need to relate that idea with an older idea to learn it .
But to do that is important understand the concepts that gave origin to that idea .
Because the idea is based in concepts that are observed due to an especific situation .
For example if we want to create a research projects we motivate our studies due to the knowledge that we obtain from book or past research .
But the idea that was create due to that knowledges are base in similaritites that we observed or some facts that are present in the area of interest .
So , for that reason I think an student need to learn but more important is understand the facts that form those concepts but mo For that reason I disagree with the statement presented here .
