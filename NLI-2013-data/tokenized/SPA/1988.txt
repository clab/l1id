I completly disagree with this statment .
I truly belive life can be enjoyed by a person of any age .
First of all I belive that just like their are allways different views of life their are also different ways of enjoying life .
For example for a kid , a life full of joy may be deffined bye the abillity to run and play .
For a teenager joy may be in the art of being in love or taking risks and learning .
Then again an elder may expirience the same ammount of joy than a young person just bye laying down on a hamac on a sunny afternoon to remember beutifull times , or to read his favorite novel .

For example if I was an elder I would love to recall my past expiriences whith woman and tell them to my grandsons .
And the stories of grandma and I to my grandoughter .
And then again as I am young their is the beuty of learning and expiriencing what I will later tell my grandchildren .
Their is a time for everything and in these times you may enjoy life in manny different ways .
