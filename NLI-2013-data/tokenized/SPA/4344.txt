Currently , there are more people who help the others than before .
At the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war .
People had big problems and they only tried to survive .
They did not want to solve the problems of the others , they only wanted to eat and to care their families .

However , right now , all the people do not have big problems and they are more implicated with their communities .
In my personal expericence I could explain these arguments with several examples .

When I was young , my teachers at highschool encouraged students to help other people in their subjects , even if that students were in an other school .
I felt very well because I coul help a lot of people who do not know how to speak or how to write .
I remeber two girls that they were 8 years old and they didnt know how to read .
I helped them twice a week during for years and they finally learn not only how to read , but also how to write .

Furthermore , when I was at the university , I created with my friends one organitation that prepare conferences in order to obtain money for poor people .
We could collected a lot of money by doing these conferences .

On the other hand , right now , I usually go to the church in order to serve food for the people who do not have nothing to eat .
More or less I often go to the church once a week .

In my view , the people are more implicate in their communities than they are before .
The society has changed because If someone explain in an interview for finding a job that he helps in his community , he probably be hired because all the companies wants honesty in their organisations .
