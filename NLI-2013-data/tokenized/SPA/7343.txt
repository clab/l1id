Traveling in a group lead by a tour guide could be a good choice for traveling .
Say or state that is the best way to travel will depend on both the destiny of the trip and the kind of person the traveler is .

Let 's supposed that you decide to travel to some unknown far away or inexplore place .
In this case , you should evaluate the possibility to travel within a group and with a tour guide .
For this case this should be the best choice .
That 's obviously because you do n't know where you are going to , you do n't know the culture , landscape , communications and transportations resources available among others characteristics that must be known when you travel abroad .

But if I know or I have an idea where I 'm headed to , I prefer to travel following my own plans and my instinct .
I do n't know if I can be called an adventurer spirit or something like that .
But since I became an adult everytime I travel I do it by my own and with my own schedule .

That way I can choose where to visit and how much time I can spent in each location .
And not only to follow a leader wich will decide for me where to go and how much time spent at each destiny .
A good idea is to save some part of your budget to buy some smalls tours in order to make your trip a little more complete and fascinating .
Beacuse when your alone you 'll let your predilections control your impulse and you may lose the opportunity to know some special place that you will like but is not , somehow , part of your vacations purpose .

For example I spent my last vacation in New York and the subject and main goal of my trip was to visit the Yankee Stadium and enjoy New York night 's life .
Of course I visited the stadium and enjoyed some open microphone bars .
But a relative told me about a tour to a Pennsilvania amusement park and I tried .
It was n't part of my plans but it was an unforgetable experienced .

In my opinion traveling with a group and a tour guide has its advantages but you must know when to choose this option .
For the moment let me travel alone and follow my own plans .
