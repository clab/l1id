In reference to the proposed question I must say I 'm mostly disagree .
Nowadays young people probably have more free time than ever .
If only they dedicate a little part of their free time to help each other in their communities , a lot of problems could be reduced , not only for the community that receives the colaboration , also for young people who participates .

Conciencing youth about enviromental problems in their own towns or cities could make they were more responsable to the nature .
I also think that it could prevent the youth to be atracted by drugs in general and alcohol in particular .

In the other hand it 's true that young people nowadays have more expectatives of the society over them and they also have more stress .
I also must say that young people now can have more and more free time posibilities , and for much of them it ' s hard to renounce to them .

In part our society is more individualist in our time , as a whole , not only the youth .
Because of this , all adults may participate helping their communities , not only young pepole .

There are a lot of activities that both boys and girls can do : working for old peolple ; childcare ; enviromental works , such as conservation of local fauna or helping in the plantation of trees ; cleaning the roads near towns ...
