At the beginning of the 21st century , the increasing number of cars in use worldwide is a key environmental issue .
It does not only affect the level of pollution in the air but it also amplifies the green house effect and it seriously endangers the sustainability of the earth 's energy ressources .
Although some important signs show a general willigness to reduce the number of cars in use , I believe the current trend is very difficult to change .

On the one hand , it is visible that there are clear forces trying to influence the increase in the number of cars .
The environmental consciousness of the public is more important than ever and could be a good driver for the reduction of the number of cars as citizens themselves decide to not use or use less frequently their cars to protect the environment .
There are also several policies put in place by givernments , mostly in Western countries , to try to reduce the usage of cars .
These policies include for instance , the development of public transports , the closure of some roads or city centers to cars or incentives given to drivers to share btheir cars to go to work .

However , I belive other factors will hamper the reduction of the number of cars in use .

In fact , one important reality once has to face is that the environment concern is more widespread in Western countries , which do not represent the majority of the earth populiation .
In parallel to the environmental movements that are growing in developped countries , there are many developping countries that are growing very fast .
And people in those countries seems to be very eager to achieve the same standards of living as we have in western countries , and this includes access to cars .

For all those resons , I do n't belive the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years although it is necessary to achieve a sustainable development of the planet .
