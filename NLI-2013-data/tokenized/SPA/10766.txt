There are a diferents situation that successful people trying new things , and successful people who do not tried .
I think that successful people always try new things because they try to success in diferents aspects but I think this is not correct .
Obviusly that if you want to be succes first you have to know well what you have to do it .
In this circunstance you will have to have a good preparation in the aspect or in the situation that you want to success .

For example I want to success in my career I am a lawyer and I wanto to be a well know lawyer in my country in that circunstances I know that I have to work very hard to do it , no trying new things just doing what I really know and doing well the tings that I really know in this way I sure that I wiil success .
Because if you tried to succes doing new things I think sometimes you can doing something that is nor correct or bad things it does not matter your intention , the things is that that you have to be sure what you are doing .

In my specific case I can not try to do new things becuase I am a lawyer and I was prepare for a specific area that is Commercial and Civil Law , and I was study a lot about this subject , and I really honest with me and with my clients when someboy ask me if I can help them with other area such as criminal law , human right or enviromental law , that are very interesting but I do not know anytihing about and them and is not correct for me to tell that this area that mention above I know and help them becuase in this way I will never success .

In conclusion I think a reall successful people just do it what they already know .
I am not agree with this statement becuase you can not tried new things if you do not well what you are doing .
Always in better to grow up carefully taking all the value that it is neccesary .
And doing well what you really know .
