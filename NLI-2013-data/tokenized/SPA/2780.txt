I disagree with the statement becuase young people have some times a better way to express their emotions , in some cases they have more energy than older people but , it does n't mean that older people lacks energy to express what they feel about life , it just a natural behavior that older people are more reserved than young people on expressing emotions .

Older people knows the great value that life means , that is why I belive that older people really know how to enjoy life .
Perhaps they have in their mind diferent types of problems or diseases they always try to be positive in those adverse situations .

Young people does not matter about some aspects that older people have in mind so they can express more easily their actitudes related with life , but they can not visualize all the time they have lived and they can give a true value about life means , while older people have lived specific situations , problems that many times they affront , this types of situations gives a more complete think or sense in what life means .

I consider that older people in some ways are considered person that are not usefull anymore , and this is a wrong statment that many young people have in their minds .
Older people are great teachers of life , youth people needs to be more related with older people is a good form to find the true meaning of life .
For instance , older people can help with their knowledge and their skills to young people on difficult situations , and advise is always accepted if became from an expert or a person who had lived an specific situation .

Perhaps older people in some need to fight with special situations like diseases , demise of a relative , economic issues , they always tried to give a positive actitude to people , and they also give an idea that perhaps all of their problems they enjoy their life as much as they were young .
