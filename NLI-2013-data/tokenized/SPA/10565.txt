I agree with the statement because I have seen this events in many oportunities .
There are important differences between successful people and no successful people .
First , they are alweys doing new or different things .
Second , they are taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Of course , there are n't only a success ' method , depend of the person and his/her situation but this is important .

First , the successful people is notorious because usually they are doing things news .
For instances , when all the people are doing big computers , had people that are thinking about to do personals computers .
Steve Wosniak , Steve Jobs and another people are doing meetings and clubs for to talk about big changes in the world with the computers .
They are thinking about building and selling personal computers .
They found successful companies such as apple and microsoft .
So , they did things new .

Second , the successful people are taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This is true .
For instances , when Wosniak is bigining with his emprise he must decided about his job in HP .
He loved his job and he was loyal with HP but , he mus take the risk and to left his job in HP in order to found and was working in this own emprise .
He take the risk .
He left his job and he found his own emprise and finally he had success .
