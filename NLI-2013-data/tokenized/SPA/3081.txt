I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

I think that probably younger people have more opportunities to lead a pleasant life , unaware of dangers , economicall worries and age - related illneses ; but I do believe that young people have less wisdom to realize that those opportunities must be well used to get joy in to their lives .

I often see young people overdriven to acomplish things in such a short time , that they cannot possibly realize that they are missing important and joyful experiences on their path .
Young people are more and more feeling the pressure to do a lot , at the cost of enjoying less .
This pressure comes from society , family , their peers , and sadly from themselves , pushing more and more to excel in so many things at the time , that they just end doing everything automatically , without stopping to see what they have acomplished .

Even though older people can be very driven to succeed , years have taugth them that as important as get things done , is the experience of doing them .

I have seen myself stressed and feeling unfulfilled after long hours in a supposedly joyfull experience , as an over planned trip , scheduled by the hour to maximize the eyesightings .
I have also seen my grandfather enjoying himself a lot by just sitting close to the window with a cup of strong tea , reading a magazine or watching the people who pass by the street .

There are pleasures of the older people that cannot compare to some rush and excitement that young people can get from partying all night and leading an accelerated life .
There is the possibility to see the kids grow and become nice people , who will honor the values they where raised in .
And there is of course the possibility to enjoy grandchildren , who can be spoiled by the grand parents while the parents struggle to teach them manners ant get them to bed early .

I also think that older people enjoy more life because they get a sense of a `` job well done '' about their families , jobs or whatever commitment they had in life , whereas young people are still trying to find their purpose .

Older people often have ( or make ) more time , to devote themselves to thing they find enjoyable , as learning something special or talking to people with related interests .
My grandmother spent long hours working two jobs when she was younger to be able to raise her kids , and never had much of a hobby , but now that she has retired , she has found great satisfaction in taking cooking lessons with neighbors that became real friends .

I am finally realizing that life can be more enjoyable than what it has been to me in the past , but this is probably because I am starting to age myself ...
I wonder if as years pass I will find more joy on the little things , and if I will be able to be delighted by seeing the passersby as my grandfather does , but I do think that with age , more things will come too , that will make me very happy .

To summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .
