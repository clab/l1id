Cars are the most used form of transport knowadays will that change in twenty years ?
it is very hard to answer .
On developed countries nearlly everyone above a certain age has a car , alot of people use it on a daily basis : to go to work , shopping , travelling and on the leisure time .
I use the car everyday and i cannot imagine life with out it and because of that i think that there will be more cars rather than fewer in twenty years .

You can argue that : Petrol is running out ! .
Everyone knows that , everyone is aware yet not many know what is going to happen with its price .
In twenty years i beleive that prices are going to increase , less people are going to be able to pay that price , people on shorter incomes will have to use other ways to move around and therefore the number of cars would be expected to decrease because people wont be able to pay the price but the problem is that there are other fuels that can be used and people will get used to having cars which are slower and less pawerfull .

I also beleive that developing countries , future super powers like china , are going to demand huge numbers of cars as the citizens get richer .
They will want to have the freedom to travel around just like europeans and americans do know .
Can you imagine how many more cars that would be ?

I think that not only there will not be fewers cars in use but there is going to be more and more , i have no idea how we are goin to manage with the number of cars but im sure that human beings will find a way to cope with it because as long as people want to use cars they will use them .
