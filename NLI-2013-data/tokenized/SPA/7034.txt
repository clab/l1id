I am agree with this statement .
The reason is that in the twenty years there were not many cars in use as now or because the people could not afford to buy it .

If we look at the history , the twenty years were not many successful for many people .
For example , in the United States although there was a period of healthy in the early twenties and people could afford to buy cars , at the last years of the century the Depression let many people witouth jobs , houses and withouth even necessary items .
As well in Europe , as always , there were so many status differences between people that only richs had the opportunity to get cars .

However , today there are a lot of differents models of cars and you can buy a car cheaper that in those years .
For example , now a little car that allow you to drive along the city costs about 6,000 euros that is a raisonable price .
Also , nowadays , you have the chance of buying a car and pay for it every month during several years , so even young people having good jobs can afford to drive their own cars .

Besides , you have the option of buying a car that have been used before .
We know that , propably the car will be broken before than a new one but , if you really need it and you do not have enough money to buy a new one , is an option that can be considered .

However if you have money to spend and you really like cars , there are a huge variety of them to buy .
Nowadays , cars almost can drive by their selves or at least , park .
This type of cars are from Japan or China and maybe , in not a long time , many people will be able to get these wonderful cars .

As we can see , today , there are so many options in the market that make possible to everyone to get a car in an economic way , if it is that they want , or to buy a super car spending more money .
However , I think that in the twenty years get a car was a thing for only rich people and it is for sure that there were not so many options as we have today to choose one , based not only in the price but also in our preferences .
