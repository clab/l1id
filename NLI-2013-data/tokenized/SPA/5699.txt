Some advertisements will make products seem much better than they really are .
The marketing industry has become more and more challenged over the years .
The public has gotten used to the words , the style and the products themselves and advertising has come to the point to be less convincing .

Trying to impress with `` words or manicured pictures '' that do not reveal the whole truth about the product in order to catch the eye of the consumer is a distraction from the reality , but the continuous repetition of the advertising makes it almost believe that the promoted product is `` real '' .

Let 's mention two clear examples :
- In the Real Estate world : Just read almost any advertising on a residence for sale .
It is written to make your dream come true and to stimulate your curiosity to see the house .
While you are in that proccess , you have almost `` falled in love '' with your next home and by the time you got to see it , you might be dissapointed ( or not ) and will have to fight with your created emotions through advertisment ( dreams ) against reality .

- Another clear example of this kind of advertising is regarding time share properties .
Have you ever assist to one of those presentations where they present the product and give you freesbees ?
The promoters will try to convince you of all the benefits of having that type of property to the point that you might agree , at the end of the presentation , that if you do not own one of those units right at that moment , you will never be able to travel again due to the increase of hotel rates and bla , bla , bla ...
What a distraction from reality !

There are many other examples in our industry : food products camuflaged under beautiful shining pictures , pills to loose weight without having to exercise or diet , the magic of certain cooking products that will make homemaker 's lifes easier and so on ...

Educate yourself and open your eyes so you will not get scammed with false statements !
