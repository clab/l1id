Is a fact more important than to understand ideas and concepts ?
The answer to this question is not easy at all .
For some , a student is better educated if he knows a great number of facts .
For others it is better to know the ideas and concepts , for this knowledge allows you to create your own facts .
This essay will analyze that ideas and concepts are more important than facts alone .

Facts , are information that allows a person to solve a situation or problem .
They are answers to questions .
For example , we know now that environmental warming today is causing the North pole to melt , that 's a fact .
But how did we get to that fact ?
That 's why facts alone should not be the most important educational element for students .
In order to create our own facts or understand how information has been created we need to understand ideas and concepts .

In connection to the above , ideas an concepts are important for they let us acquire knowledge of facts by ourselves .
For example , if a student gets trained in advanced math , he will possibly be able to create his own math theories .
In other words he will be able to create or explain facts .
This evidently conforms a better education for a student .

In conclusion , ideas and concepts are more important and have more educational value .
A student that knows facts will not have the abilities of one that understands ideas and concepts .
In this sense my personal opinion has been proved .
It is better knowing how to create facts than getting the answers from a book .
