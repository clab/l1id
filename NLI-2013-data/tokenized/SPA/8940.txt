I agree with the statement proposed , here is why .
Education has walked a long way to become what it is today .
Take your father 's class and you will be confronted by a `` memory rules '' approach .
Everything has changed and the place of the memory is one of the biggest victim of this evolution .

`` Learning facts '' has the fatal flaw of beign associated with memory , otherwise , how you will remember a date , an event or the name of one president ? .
A fact is just a tale of something that happend .

The last couple of years saw an increase in education research .
tens of theories has been proposed and in some cases , has been tested .
One has emerged as the current champion : Constructivity .

Constructivity means that everything we are going to learn has to be builted on the shoulders of something we already know .
That way , we are not dealing with a million of separate facts to remember but with a few knowladge networks that will activate a couple of related ideas every single time we touch one of the ideas belonging to the same network .

What 's the magic of these ? , that studies had proved that we have three tipes of memory , a short-term , a mid-term and a long term one .

Short term allow us to dig a lot of information but to lose it fast , medium will let us remember that we have touched the subject , but the details will be gone .
Long term memory is composed of all the things that impact us in a unusual way or the things we use every day .
Constructivity tries to place our knowladge in the medium and large-term area by changing the frecuency of use .
