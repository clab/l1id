Traveling is for me the best way to get to know newpeople and their culture .
By traveling you will know different places and experience the trip in your own skin is something that you will never forget .
You can read many books about a particular place but it is only when you travel that you understand the culture , architecture , etc. of that place .

Many people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and I totally disagree with that statment .
I think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map .
I have several reasons for holding that opinion .
First of all , traveling in groups with a tour guide does not give you the freedom to move around that you might want .
When you travel by yourself you decide where to go and when .
For example I remmember when I traveled in a group of fifteen persons with a tour guide in Paris four years ago .
I planned and scheduled all my trip with this group and its guide because I did not want to travel alone .
It turned out that I had a really bad experience with them .
I was required to get up very early in the morning because the excursions started at sunrise .
Imagine that experience for me that I am not a morning person ! .
Moreover I did not get along with the people in the group .
There was a big age difference that conditioned all our decisions .
When I wanted to go to a pub at night the rest of the group preferred to stay at the hotel playing cards .
I think they did n't realize they were in Paris .

Secondly , traveling in groups with guide is far more expensive than traveling by yourself .
You can decide where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alone .
You know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it .
For example , you can decide to pay a boat around the river instead of paying a museum .

To sum up I think that traveling alone far outweigh the fact of traveling in groups .
I must also say that the information that a tour guide can give you during the trip can also be found in many travel guides and books .
So you might want to read a little bit before departuring .
