Not all the times the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
It depends of the country , the age and the manners of the person .

When you are going to travel to a country that speak the same language , it is not as necesary to have a guide as if you do not speak the same language .
It is like if you speak spanih and you are gonig to travel to Germany you need someone to help you to understand , but if you travel to Spain is not too difficult because despite that you do not know that country you can talk with them without problem .
Other thing is that old people do not like to travel with a guide , and young people yes .
This is because for example a couple of old people are going to Europe , if they go with a group led by a guide , maybe they can not mantain the rythm all the time like waiking up early , walking a lot , or eating in any restaurant .
I mean , they are going to want to do the things in the time that they want , and not be directed by anyone .
Every change if go a couple of young people , beacuse they are going to want to make all the day activities , and to visit evey part of Europe .
The manners of be of everyone also depends a lot , because if you are someone that do not like to receive orders , or follow instructions , you are not going to accept be led by a tour guide .
Also if you are not friendly , maybe you can have problems with the other people .

With this we can see that it depends of the persons and as everything it has good and bad things to go with a tour guide .
