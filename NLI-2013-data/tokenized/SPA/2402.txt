I do not aggre with the statement .
It is obvious that youngsters and older people have different ways to spend their time , but it has to do more with generation matters than with their capacity of doing enjoyable things .

I know it is a common belief that during the youth one has a wider range of activities to enjoy , but a more carefully view of the facts might change this position .
There are two main factors that could support my point .

In first place , an important factor is the experience .
The experience gives a person the capacity of making better decisions but also gives one a better perspective of life .
Both things help older people to enjoy some events or things which young people do not .
Secondly , older people usually can be benefited from resources they have save during their youth .
Thus , the avaliability of greater resources among older people can also contradict the idea that young people enjoy life more than those older ones .
Commonly , young people have to spend a lot of time generating those resources .

However , it has to be said that young people have some other advantages over older people regarding the capacity of enjoy some activities .
The main advantage is naturally their energy and - usually - health .
Young people have more energy and are usually healthier .
For that reason they can enjoy better things involving physical activity .
The main example of this is sexuality , but there are a lot of other examples like sports .

In balance .
I think both youngters and older people have many things to enjoy .
And there is no reason to think one of those groups is more able to enjoy life .
