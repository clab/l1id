There is the arguement whether young people or older people enjoy life the most .
Some may argue that older people might enjoy life the most , since they think they are getting older and might die soon .
But I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do for many different reasons .

Young people want to live life to the fullest , and are willing to experience more than older people .
For example the tought of dying is not as present in a young person 's mind as it would be in an older person .
Therefore the young person is more likely to live the moment and not worry so much in the concequences that it might have in the future .
Another reason for arguing that young people enjoy life more , is that a younger person is healthier than an older individual .
By being healthier the person has more mobility , and energy to do more activities , and travel around the word .
Now days there is more technology that young people now how to use to their benefits , making their lives easier , leaving more time for entertaining activities , and leasure time .

Unlike younger people old people 's health as good .
As time passes by the body gets weaker and loses its strength .
There are more older individuasl suffering from a dissease which limitites their mobility , than younger people .
Older people have more thing to worry about that younger people , such as children and bills .
A lot of older people are not used to the technology that is offered now days , therefore most of them might not be encourage to using , and trying new things .

Their health , their stronger bodies , the mentallity , the willing to try new things , and the technology used by young people .
Unlike them older people lack of health and are more resistant to try new stuff .
And for those are the different reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older people .
