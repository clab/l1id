The form that people enjoy their life can depend of different kinds of factors like their age or surrounding .
The appreciation of other people life can not always be right because we do not know how it have been development in differents situations or stages .

I am a young person , thus it is difficult to me explain how or why people enjoy more their life when is young or older .
Each step in the life line has his own advantages and disadvantages and the way that you support it can be the stone that helps to built your life .
Maybe old people can enjoy the life more than younger because they are in the cappacity of analize which parts of their lifes are complete and were the best , they have an objective way to see their own development .
When you are older can discovered a different way to see the world , the people or the activitites that used to do .
But the age does not come only with the expirience , it comes with some illness and , in many cases , with lonelyness .

Another point that influences the life development is the people who surround it and the way you interact with they .
When you are young you have the opportunity of known new people every day and you can take more risk possitions because you have more time to enjoy the life in a crazy way .
In addition sometimes you have your parents advice and it can give you the indications to follow your own way .

Life have differents points of view some of them are influenced by the age .
