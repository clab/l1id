It is widely believed that youth is synonimous of happiness , health and well-being .
According to my experience , I think that in this respect youth is a concept that should be more related to the soul rather than to the biological age .

I have met two groups of young people .
The first group is formed by those people who really enjoy life and live in a healthy and happy way .
Despite their age and few experience , they are able to handle life issues in a very creative and optimistic manner .
The second group is formed by those who face life as a battle where they have to fight with each other , as in a competition , missing the beauty of the journey , always looking to the goal .
Most of the time , the latter group , because of their lack of experience and wisdom , may find themselves trapped in their own personal psychological conflicts , which prevents them from enjoying life fully .

It goes the same for the elderly .
There are , according to my experience , two groups .
On the one hand , there is the group of healthy people who really enjoy life , most of the time even much better than most of young people .
These people are wiser and have learnt how to better deal with life challenges .
They are healthy and are engaged in plenty of outdoors and indoors activities .
They really deserve admiration and respect , and should be regarded accordingly .
On the other hand , there is the group of people who is always living in the memories of a past that is never coming back , with regrets and sadness .
People , who have not became wiser but , instead , melancolic and angry .
People who , probably due to personal circumstances , have lost their joy and the taste for life .

So , I do not agree neither disagree with the above-mentionned statement , since I believe that age is in the soul and in the person 's feelings rather than in the physical appearance and biological age .
