Must people try new things and take riks in order to get success ?

In my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all days is `` yes '' , for the next reasons .

First , this is a learning world .
I mean , a lot of knownlege and information is produced everyday , so the people who want to sucess they have to be avialable learn new things every day .
Some reachers are found that the people must chance thier major aor carrer unleast one time in thier life .

Second , in business are a lot of stories where the people that do n't take a risk and chance , lost a lot of money .
Besides , the people who innovate has success .
Examples of that are the transistor in the electronics business and the digital watch , that brings to Japan to the first world after the second world war .
Other contries with more avantage than Japon did not want to take the risk .
Japan did it and now it is the one of the most important economic in the world .

Also , It is easy to find a lot of personal stories of succes around new tecnologies and Internet .
Yahoo , Google and You Tube based theirs success in a strange idea , work with out direct pay .
So they offer a lot of service like mail , search information and host web page and videos without a recive any pay for that .
They people who create the web portal take the risks and everybady know the story they made a los of millons of dollars .

In the other hand , for each one of the people that take risk and become a successful people a lot of people fail .
So take a risk it is n't a warranty to success .
But what I can say is that every successful people had take a risk and try new things .
