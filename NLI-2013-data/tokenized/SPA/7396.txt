Is it better to travel with a tour ?
I would have certainly answered yes to this question a long time ago , however I changed my mind completely .
It all started five years ago when I organized a trip to Europe with my best friend .
First of all I 'll write about the disadvantages from my own point of view , and later on I will expose the advantages of a guide while you are travelling .

When travelling with a tour guide you have almost everything controlled , even the timing for the bathroom .
Are those really vacations ?
Certainly it is easier if you do n't know the place you are visiting and your are not a risk taker person .
He or she will take you to the most important sights of the place you are visiting , but if you really liked a place , such as a little town , a museum or plaza , you wo n't be able to take your time and stay there .
A bus will be waiting for you , with people in it , also waiting for you .
What if you want to go back and buy that souvenir you left for the end of the visit ?
Well you are not going back because there is a schedule to respect in order to comply with it .
I gues that the worst part of travelling with a tour is the group .
You might be lucky and be part of a very fun group where all of the people has more less the same interests .
But , what happens if you are the younguest one in a tour where almost everybody is in their 60's !
That obviously will not be fun , or everyone is travelling in couples and you are alone , it will be more complicated to make friends and hang out during the day .
Another complicated thing about tours is that generally , they stop in the most important places to visit , and there might also be magical little towns and spots that are worth visiting .
A tour is going to give you the general idea of the country you are visiting , it will not take you to the local places where local people go .

In the other hand , travelling with a group can also be fun and can give solution to a lot of small planning problems that can be presented when less expected .
Sometimes , when you are travelling by yourself you do n't spend too much time to eat , and a tour is contemplating that time , specially during breakfast .
Also a tour is going to keep you very well informed about historic passages and data that is always useful to know .
Addtionally , there will always be someone that can communicate with locals if you do n't speak their language .
If you are a precautious person , you will make some research about the people that will be also travelling with you , because they are going to be your family during your stay .
It will surely be fun if you take a trip with a tour where all of the tourists are your age .

Travelling in a tour led by a guide can always be fun if you keep in mind that you are not going to have complete control of the situation .
Maybe it 's the best option if your are travelling to a very different country like China or Russia .
However , it is always fun to be adventurous and explore new things by yourself .
Always make a deep research of the place you are visiting in order to avoid further complications .
I certainly think that making a trip with or without a tourist guide is always fun , it all depens on how well you want to spend your time and the disposition you have to make fiends and have fun .
