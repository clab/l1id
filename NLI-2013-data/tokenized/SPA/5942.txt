I am disagree with the statement , and I do not believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than are there are today .

In twenty years the world will look like very different than is today .
In the future there will be more tecnological advantages and the companies will construct diferents types of transportations similar to the cars .
For example , will be machines that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air , and everyone can have one , because the cost to manufacture will be lower .

Also the people want to go far away or faster , becasue their need will change over the time .
Altough this view of the future , there will be people that think in the enviorement , and the people will be prefers use the bicycle or other transportation that do n't cause a damage to the earth .

If a can live in the future I think I will below the group that protect the enviorement , and i will prefer to have a clean air than a car .
However , The perspective that I have of the future is a little negative , the industrie grow really quickly , and the technology helps in the development of the world , but also helps in the distruction .
The wants and needs of the people changes , they want to have more electronic things for have an esier live .
Also the time will be preciose in the future , and they need to have a car to go to the jobs and meetings in a fast way .
That is way , I believe that there will be more cars in the future .

Finally , if in the future will be more cars , I can help in the construction of this transportation , and that will be something that do not damage the world .
I am an industrial designer , therefore , my work is create a positive perspective of the future and design positive things that help the needs of the people in the future .
