I disagree that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I really think that the ways of energy for cars and other characteristics will be different but still there will be cars .
Following some explanations :

Nowawdays , the petrolum is becoming more and more expensive .
The ways to obtain petrolum are more costly and sophisticated to reach certain areas in the deep of the oceans or earth .
In additon , petrolum can be found in oceans that are lead by extremist countries , which is a cause of conflicts or even war in extreme situations .
The gas for the cars is becoming unaffordable to many people that uses the car as a mean of tranport .

The research of alternative ways of energy to substitute the gast is a real need .
This research has been already started in many countries and by many companies , therefore cars that use solar energy or other types of energy already exist .
Today , the cost of these innovative cars is higher than current cars .
On the other hand , I belive that the sooner the gas is not any more available or only available to very small part of the population , the demand of these new innovative cars will be increased and prices will be down making the innovative cars affordable .

People that has a car today is used to have one .
They use it for real needs like going to work , shopping , transportat or moving from one city to another if there is no other mean of transport .
Some people is so dependent to the car that they use a car for ocasions where it could be more effective to walk , take the train or the bus .

In 20 years time the need will still be there and the car way of energy could be different .
I think that the appearance of the cars would be also different according to the new times : shape , size , materials , safety complements inside the car .
