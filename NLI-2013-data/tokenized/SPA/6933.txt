Nowadays when you are in the street , the first thing you can notice is the amount of cars that each day collapse the roads of the cities since the first minute early in the morning .

The fact of seeing hundreds of cars in the streets depends on the country you are , and the city in that certain country too , as not all the cities have the same traffic levels .

Here in Spain , you can easily notice the difference when you travel to Madrid and when you come to my city , Burgos .
In Madrid it is nearly impossible to go out by car whereas in Burgos you do not usually have problems with the traffic .

From my humble point of view , I think that people is becoming in gerenal very lazy when having to choose whether to use the car or not .
In Madrid , I would not use the car because it is obvious that you arrive everywhere before if you go by bus or underground .
In the other hand , in a small city like Burgos it is healthier to go by bus or even walking as distances are very short .

It might sound extrange after having said this but , I do have driving licence although I don ' t have a car but I hope not to become an obsesed girl with my car in the future and not to use it unless it is neccessary .

Due to this lazy society that we are creating and the fact that we are all the time improving the cars , which makes people more interested in them , I think that in the future we wo n't be able to solve this problem .
If nowadays we disagree with the number of cars that we are seeing each day , I think that this is nothing compared with the amount of them that each day are going to appear for example in twenty years time .

In the end , I would like to add that by the contrary , I think that we will have to assume it as it is part of the evolution and developpment of our industry and tecnology .
