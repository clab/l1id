when you have any problem , Will the memory hep you to solve that problem ?
or maybe will be more usefull the logic ?
In any aspect of our life we find problems wich are waiting to be solve , to find out their solution we have to use our brain , our capability to develop a solution .
Understand ideas and concepts help us to think .

Firstly , when we are young is necesary to learn facts that will be our basic backgrounds to develop our mind .
However when we became in adults , we need more than know when had place a certain fact .
Understanding ideas we unconsciently learn to solve problems by our own , not only in our dailly life but also in other different aspets of our lifes .

Secondly , thinking in academic life we can use an example .
Imagine a Maths class , the teacher gives you a mathematical problem .
In that case , memory could not help to you .
You need to understand the ideas and the concepts that you learned before .
There are a important relation betwen a huge range of stuffs in our lifes related to the maths .

Concluding , where is the convenience to know a great amount of facts if we do n't know how they interact ?
