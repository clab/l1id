We are living in a material world in wich technological advance , social status and political development are leading young people to become more egocentric and less able to find joyce or satisfaction in life .
More young people than elderly people become less intersted on enjoying the beauty of living and the emotion in simple things .

New generations are more concentrated on getting a social statuss based on academical and professional success , and financial adquisition that prove to others how independent and successful they are .
Media and culture set up social values such as beauty and popularity , that for many young people become an obssesion and most important goal in life .

It is not a wonder that public nacional parks , and family entretaiment centers are more visited by elderly people , who always seem to be more happy and peaceful by just having a walk in the mittel of the forest , by watching a sunrise or just by going in the nature many of them find the most quiet and interesting point in their lifes when they have acomplished most of their professional and educational goals in life , so that they can spend more time at home with their families and friends , so that the can enjoy life .

Young people 's standards and goals to acomplish are becoming more coplex and hard by each generation , so that many of them become depresed or descoraged very easy .
For the new generation it is becoming less interesting and motivating things that their grand parents used to do when they were young .
Perhaps many young people may find the happines that they are looking for by learning from those that have more experience in life than our selves .
Most of the time , young people may have the opportunity to expercience things that do not use to do in their busy lifes finding the beuty and joy of living and being a human been with feelings and emotions .
