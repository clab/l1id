In my life I have visited a variaty of nations .
I have come to comprehend the complexity of some cultures as well as the unique characteristics each nation provides .
Each cultural enviroment provides a characteristic to mandkind 's identity .
The language , the food and the history every nation in the world provides is be experienced when one travels to that nation .
Once we are surrounded by that culture we can explore it in a variaty of ways .
Two ways are by ourselfs and by guidence of a tourguide .
What I have come to realize is that a trip becomes more gratifying , as well as at the same time it provides a greater cultural aspcet of the nation , when does it with a tour guide .

Although the first argument against my opioin is that with a guide we are attained to his shcedule this comes to play a small part in the desire turist have to adquire knowledge from a foreing nation .
It might be true that with a group and a guide we are enshrouded in a surrounding where desicions are made by the majority .
What comes to be more relevant is that although as an individual in a grup we are unable to decide where to go as an individual we do not know where to go .

In order to adquire a diverse aspect of the culture we visit we must learn what characterizes the culture .
A tour guide is more than able to explain where the culture of the nation stands out for its unique characteristics .
A tour guide provides as well what I personally seek in a trip , knowdlege about the nations history .
By ourselfs we are able to visit far more scenarios but at the same time we are unable to grasp the meaning behind each scenario .
In a trip I preffer to see few scenarios but once I come home I return with a load of cultural background conserning each scenario i visited .
The pleasure each experience grants me is greater when I know the social , political , economic and historic background that the experience withholds .

Some do not like the pressure a group imposes .
I rather think of the shcedule in a group as the best way to handle my time in a trip .
With a shcedule I regulate the time it takes me to visit each place in the culture I seek to explore .
I preffer to know what I should learn from rather than wander around the city I visit .
As an individual I would get of track my trip when I start to think of what I must do in order to get the most gratification out of my time in that nation .

A guide provides information , a schedule and when we combine these two aspects a guide comes to provide a vast cultural knowldge I desire to discover .
What a trip evokes in my mind is an unsaciable thrist of knowledge .
This thrist would unlikely be calm down by my own .
It is best if I have someone that is able to give me the background information of the mation I visit .
By visitng a nation with a guide and a group I also learn from a new perspective .
What to me might be intresting to some member of my group that same object stands out as dull .
A guide and a group come to provide experiences , poins of view , cultural knowledge that when put together create a cultural diversity which comes to transalte into a remarkable trip .
