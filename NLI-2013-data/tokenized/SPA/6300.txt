I agree with the statement : I believe that in some years there will be fewer cars in use than today .
I think that there are a lot of reasons to support this statement .

I accept that cars are really necesary and important .
It is difficult to imagine a week without car : some people need it to work with it , other need it to go to work , shopping , travelling , etc .
Furthermore , some cars are important tools for different public agents , like police , firemen , abulance drivers , bus drivers , etc .
Cars give to the society a lot of important services , including enjoying free time or working every day .

But , on the other hand , cars have a very important defect that makes me think that in the future there will be fewer cars .
They deppend on an expensive and harmful material : petroleum .
The reserves of this fluid are fewer every year .
Furthermore , every day is harder and more expensive to acces to the rest of the reserves , and more money is needed in orther to obtain it .
Therefore , I believe that this fact will make gasoline and diesel more expensive every day , and this will be the first reason for a reduction of the actual quantity of cars running on the streets .
The expensiver the petroleum is , the lower quantity of people who can acces to a car and it cost of operation .

Moreover , there is another good reason for this statement : the pollution .
Burning of gasoline produces a lot of toxic and potentially dangerous substances .
If you take a look to the sky in a big city , you will find a brown cloud of pollution .
We breath this every day .
I believe that people will have more health problems in the future because of this toxic substances .
The goverments have began to try to control this emissions , and one of the steps is to reduce the amount of cars on the streets .

Another reason that I mantain is that people is concerned about the importance of doing research in this field .
I believe in technology .
And furthermore , there are another different ways to go form one side to another .
For instance , bicicle or little motorbikes are more efficient and cheap .

To summarize , I agree with the statement .
I believe that the actual situation is becoming quite difficult , with huge traffic jams and health problems .
And I think that the first step to solve this situation is to reduce the amount of cars on the streets .
