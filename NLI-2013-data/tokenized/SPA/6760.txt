I completely agree with the statement .
Although I can not be one hundred percent positive about this fact I think there is a clear trend towards reducing the use of cars in our society .
I must admit that I completely support it There are several reasons that support my opinion .
First , there is an evident increasing trend in terms of transport diversification that has a direct impac in the reduction of the use of the car .
Tube , aeroplanes , urban buses , fast trains ...
are new ways of transport addressable to the public that did n't exist before .
When my parents were young going from Madrid to Barcelona on a plane was unbelievable as there were just one flight during the day and they were extremely expensive .
Nowadays , with the drop in prices of flight tickets , nearly everybody can afford it .
The same happened with the tube .
In the past , just a few cities had tube systems whereas currently , most cities have underground or are planning to open it or increase the number of lines Second , Governments from most countries and the European Union institutions are continuously encouraging the Public Transport and the fewer use of cars .
In my opinion , this is considerably reasonable taking into account the pollution that cars generate , the congestions and the high number of cars accident .
For example , in some cities as London , Frankfurt , Rome , etc ...
to access to the city centre , citizens have to pay a certain amount of money , which clearly show the Government willingness to reduce the number of cars Third , as new communication systems develop ( Internet , mobile phones ... )
the need to actually move from one place to another ( let 's say for a meeting ) reduces and the need to use cars reduces as well For all the reasons explained above I think that there would be fewer use cars in use in the future .
Big car manufacturers as Toyota , Ford or Mercedes ...
will have to struggle in the future in order to achive good economic performance .
I am pretty sure that they will try to encourage the car sale offering attractive discounts etc ...
but I do not think that they will be able to stop what it 's already an increasing tremd
