I think that young people enjoy life more than old people because young people have more energy , have more free time , and have less responsabilities .

Young people have more energy than old people , for example when I was very young I used to rock climb .
When I used to climb I used to have a lot fun and enjoy the outdoors .
I used to fell very happy , like a was free .
Now I can do it anymore because I do n't have the energy anymore my body does n't want to do it anymore .

Young people have more free time than old people , for instance they can do more things to enjoy their life .
when I am in the park I see all the young teenegers talking to their friends and having a good time , in contrast I see the woman who have her littles kids runing around them .
She is not having a good time , so the older you get the less time you have for yourself .

I believe the young people have less reponsabilities for example they usually do n't have to pay bills , they do n't have to worry about going to work or how can I be more sucessfull .
When you are young you just worry about where I am going this weekend ? .
Young people can just go to movies or stay home without having anything to worry about , but old people always have to think about something that they have to do .
Old people think to much before doing something that is way old people can enjoy every moment of their lives .
I always heard from many people that best moments of their lives where went they where young .
Is like the firts kizz .

In conclusion , young people can enjoy their life better because they have more energy to do what they like , they have more free time and they do n't have to many responsabilities .
