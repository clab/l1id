in my opinion you have to consider a lot of things for when you are traveling this all different things will affect where you go and how you spend your time wherever you will go .

in my opinion traveling in a group led by a tour guide has a lot of good and bad things .
the good things are that you get to see museums to learn about a lot of stuff of the place you are visiting it is also easier to travel with someone that knows the place you are going and who can understand the language of the place they are going .
but you are also limited to the number of things you can do or the number of places you can go if you were with no tour guide .

on the other hand traveling in a group with no tour guide has many positive and many negative things .
some of the positive things have to do with the night life you can go wherever you want at whatever time you want , you can change plans whenever you want like if you planned to go to italy and in the last minute you decided you want to go to germany instead then you would just by a plane ticket that easy !!!

some of the bad things is that you could get lost or something could happen to you and there was nothign you could do if you didnt have someone who knew the place and spoke the same language .

in my opinon the best way to travel is with no tour guide because i like taking risks and going to places by myself .
