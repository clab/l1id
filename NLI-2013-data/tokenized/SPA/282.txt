Is it more important for students to undersand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?

Every idea and concept is based on a fact .
Some students are smart and learn by reading and understanging a new concept .
Some others take longer to undestand it .
At the end , the slower student might memorize an idea or a concept , and might get an excellent scores in an exam .
But how will he apply this new knowledge to the real life if he never undestood what it meant ?

Learning a concept or an idea first will help you to use your imagination .
The tutor will tell you a new concept to learn , explain you what it is , and follow up with a given definition .
However , what will the results be if you apply it all the way round ?

What will happen if you start by the observing the facts ( for example , watching some chemical reaction you 've never seen before ) .
Once you observe it , you come up with a conclusion , you get into the class and learn that what you have observed has a name , followed up by an explanation of it , so you expand your reasoning and come up with your own idea of the concept .

I believe reasoning is stronger that memory .
Memory gets forgotten and reasoning stays .
If so , concepts and facts might get forgotten sooner than learning first the fact by experiencing and understanding it .

By learning the fact first , you will end up learning the concept based on your own ideas .
