I agree with the statement on the idea that the best way to travel is when one is guided by someone that knows the place .
Nevertheless , I disagree with it when it says that it necessaryly has to be with a group led by a tour guide .
My personal opinion is that traveling by one 's own sometimes can be a disaster , so I think that being guided is a good point .
On the other hand , I think that travel groups of people that does not know each others are not a good combination .
I will describe arguments supporting it as well as I will refute travel groups .

First of all , I would like to stress the imporatance of knowing the place that one plans to visit .
People usually visit large cities where there are a huge variety of museums , atractions or bars .
I strongly believe that it is almost impossible that one person can know such a big city without having lived there for a long period .
Therefore , it does not make sense to visit a city that you already know .
What I mean with this reasonement is that a group of travelers need a guide to completely take advantage of some place .
In my personal opinion , the more one knows the person that has to guide , the more confortable and enjoying a travel could be .
I also know that there are many travel guide books , some of them really complete ; however , I still think that knowing the best of a place is something that hardly can be learnt reading from a book .

The second argue that I said I would describe is why I think that travel groups are not the most suitable choice .
A travel is something that people does no usually do very often , it can be due to lack of money or free time .
This fact inmediately makes a travel be something to enjoy and not a rutine at all .
I find that sometimes travel groups , even more when they have a extrict schedual , do not allow you the necessary freedom to enjoy vacations .
People usually have very stressed lives and the last thing one needs on vacation is to be more stressed with more scheduals and compulsory tasks .
In addition , I find that traveling with a big group of unknown persons is not as confortable and satisfactory as traveling only with friends , couple or family .

These are the two main reason because I partly agree and disagree with the statement .
To sum up , I would like to stress the importance of traveling with someone guiding ; and how unsuitable I find doing it with a group .
