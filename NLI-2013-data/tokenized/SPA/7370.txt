Every trip is different , and every trip should be different .

Some may see guided tour groups as an effective way of missing the actual `` spirit '' of a place , be it an archeological site , a small village off the beaten path , or a modern urban centre .
Tour guides always seem to be in a rush , and not really interested in supporting the creation of an emotional link to the place you are visiting .
They just repeat a bunch of facts , dates and statistics , compressing what took may be hundreds of years to be made into a five minutes `` instant memory '' .

You better bring your camera , if you are to tell yourself later that you actually put your feet on the famous place you so badly wanted to know .

That might be the point of view of a youngster , a man in his early twenties , ready to take on the world and its many hidden treasures .
But what if you are a fifteen years old girl with a free ticket to any destination , or to that matter a fifty years marriaged coupled ready to retire for a while ?
Is it that clear that they should go and endure a whole trip , with its many surprises and probably challenging moments ?

Tour guides should not be regarded as the only way to gaining access to a particular destination and its features , but as a key agent in getting in contact with the place and people you are visiting .
There are different types of guided tours , and you can always get some literature about the place you are traveling to .
Be sure to choose the tour that fits best your actual desire and capacity to visit a foreign wonder .

It 's always better to try and get a local onto your side .
Sometimes they 're really open , and interested in helping strangers to get to where the real fun is .
And as long you find a common language to use with them - even a sign language - they 'll take places not included in the most popular lists , but sure to make your experience a lot more authentic and enjoyable .
