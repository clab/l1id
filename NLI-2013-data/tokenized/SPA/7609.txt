Much of the traveling that takes part in the world is in new sites for the ones that undergone the trip .
Although direction of the travleing could beneffit from some expert , with some tour guide , I defenitly preffer not to travel with one .

My main reason , is that I like traveling to the unknown .
With this in mind , the use of a tour guide will ruin this fasination .
Two years ago , my girldfriend and I went to Europe and in the airplane met other couple that were traveling to the same destination .
Even , we stay in the same hotel .
They decided to walk freely on the streets , enter the places they wanted , go to events that the very same day were anounced or hear about , among other actions .
All this decitions alowed them to presence very exciting things that happened in the city , and that make news all over the world .
In contrast , we keep secure , completely safty , nothing exciting schedule of going to the museams and castless .

Second , is that I like flexibility in my vacations .
It is enough the time constrait in my job , the unflexible schedules , to bring it with me to my hollydays , the time of the year I travel .
For example , in the second year of collage me and my friends went to Chiapas , Mexico , to visit the Mayan piramids .
At that trip we were lead with a tour guide with a very unflexible schedule .
This make us impossible to enjoy the trip because of the timing and the places we already want it to spend the most .

After this experiences , I decided never traveling with a tour guide again .
That is way I enjoy traveling without a tour guide .
