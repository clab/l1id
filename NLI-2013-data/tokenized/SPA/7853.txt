the best way to trevel is not in a group lead by a tour guide .
Because every person needs the oportunity to explore new placessby themself .
with a tourist guide you will only see what the guide show you in fact you can find a whole world and new experiences by yoursel that a guide will not show you .

Its beatifull when you can explore and touch things by yourself without the nessecity of somebody telling you every little thing you are watching or doing .
exploring and discovering new places its like a kid opennig a gift .
its exiting and an experience that you will never forget .

A tourist guide will alueys guide you for famous and important places for the society or for the world , that means you can lost a lot of places that are out of the rout of the guide , you will be only listening and looking at the things they told you to or the places they take you and you will be always with a group it also can be good but its better to experiment things by yourself In my pinion you will never know the place you go until you interact with the people ore until you live real experiences in that palce , i think that with a tour guide you olnly will see the surface of the place and you will miss things that may be hide , the experience by yourself can be more funny and extreme .

In conclussion i think that to really visit a place or to really know a place people should travel by themself , they will see palces that a guide willn not show them and they wuill live experiences that are not for a group experiences with themself , its possible to get lost but it will be an adventure that nowbody showld lost
