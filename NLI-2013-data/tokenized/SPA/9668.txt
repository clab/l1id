Nowadays , there are numerous debates about the issue whether or not people success by trying new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Some people hold the opinion that it is true that people can only sucess by doing new things .
However , in my opinion , I disagree with the statement because successful people can success by doing the same things they already know how to do well .

First of all , the crucial reason in holding my opnion is that when people do things that they already know they do not have to worry about the risks that follow after they do it .
For instance , my father is an owner of a supermarket .
He has run the business for ten years , and when we moved to Canada he is still thinking of opening a new supermarket here .
By doing this , he does not have to worry about how to manage the business or how to improve the business because he already has the experience of how to run it .
Another example could be when a person wants to switch to another job such as being a doctor , chances are that she will not be successful being a doctor .
Thus , you do not have to worry about what will happen next if you continue to do things that you already know .

Furthermore , another reason in holding my opinion is that by doing things that you already know will help you not to make mistakes .
For example , my mother is working as an accountant and when she met her friend Veronica , who works in the stock , she encourage her to invest her money in the stock because she says that it will double or even triple her money .
As my mother does not know anything about investment , she trusted Veronica because she thinks that she will never betray her , and invest all her money in the stock market .
As a result , the stock market went down and she losses all her money .
This is a clear example on how people can make mistakes when they do not know about the subject , and thus be unsuccessful .

All in all , I think that people will be more successful by doing what they already know instead of trying new things and take risks , because they do not have to worry about what will happen to them and also it will help them not to make mistakes .
Therefore , for these reasons I would say that risks takers are not as successful as people who do things that they already know how to do .
