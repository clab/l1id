I believe that the degree of stress that a particular person is exposed , or has to be exposed , throughout his or her entire life is very important .
Most of us are not aware how stress consumes our energy and finally , limits our ability to live in a more relaxed way .
I am convinced that stress does n't contribute in the level of happiness for a person .
I 'd say that the more stress a person experiences , the less happiness he or she will feel .

Happiness is the state of mind that helps a person to enjoy life and it 's the emotion that makes us appreciate the things that life has to offer in a more positive manner .

There are people who consider that young people just do not appreciate life with the importance it has .
Young people just do not pay attention to small details and their way of life goes rather faster in comparison to somebody who has reached certain age .
On the top of that , a young person is expected to make major choices that will change him or her for the future , such as finding the proper school and studies , starting a family and other stressful decisions .

On the contrary , some people would claim that is is older people who are experiencing a better way to live theirs lifes .
They do not have to be worried about what most of the people do during their whole life , such as education , professional goals , and so on .
Instead , they live with greater experience and emotional maturity that allow them to be less aprehensive and stressful .

However , I think that age alone plays no significant role in terms of enjoying life .
I strongly believe that happiness is the result of a number of factors both in the environment and in the personality of a particular person .
Medically speaking , depression can be associated both in young and older people as well as there are people that consider themselves happy regardless of their ages .
Finally , I think that we all have the opportunity to enjoy life no matter how old , or young , we are .
