The statment affirms that in twenty years will be fewer cars that there are today .
Agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be , for the next twenty years , the goals of the governments and their population , and why not the private companies .

On one side , It could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty years all the states with big populations will be able to offer other secure and massive means for transport , for example .
In that case , and only in that case , it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer cars in twenty years from now .

That possibility implies that governments will have at least to strong compromises .
One would be with its own population , trying to offer them different a effectives means of tranport for all of them .
The second compromise would be with the environment , trying to respect not only the well-known Kyoto Protocol but , of course , trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to a pollution problems

But on the other side , we can also view the coin by the other face .
Even if the technology can be improved during the next twenty years , it will be very difficult that normal people can reach all the advances .
In that case , in the non developed countries and maybe in many developing countries , the cars could keep their own place as the main mean of transport .

It is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the changes in the case of Africa , the poorest continent of the world .
Even in Europe could not be possible to erase or to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years .
There are many countries with problems in that particular area that have been trying to solve them , such as Italy , Spain and France ...
and they failed .

In Latin America , and I think also in North America , a car is a symbol of power and of prestige .
In that cases I think it could be difficult the change of mind for the next twenty years .

To all the things I pointed out I must add the fact that daily all cars companies are producing new models of cars , fasters and luxurious , but not cheapest , to improve and to renew the old models .
Tokyo Motorshow ...
could be a good example of this .

To sum up , I think either possibilities are open for the discussion and even in my case I am not sure about which one could be the best to agree with that .
But in my particular way , if I was asking to see my future ...
I would like to ha a car .
