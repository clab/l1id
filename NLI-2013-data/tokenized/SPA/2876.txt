Young people and older people enjoy their life in different ways .
Some people think that young people enjoy life more than adults , however other people think the opposite .
I will discuss both points of views and finally give my opinion .

Young people enjoy their life in several ways .
Children have fun playing with their toys , they can spend hours playing with them and they do not get bored .
Teenagers like to go out with their friends and also to go to parties .
For example , as a teenager I like to go to the beach with my friends and go to discos and pubs .
Young people also enjoy life when they reach a goal .
For instance , I felt really happy when I won the first place with my friends in a rugby competition .
Children also enjoy and feel happy when they know someone protects them and give them love .

Older people have fun and enjoy life in many ways .
Adults feel happy when they reach a goal or they get something important .
For example , when my father was hired in a very good company in my country he was really glad and I noticed he was enjoying it .
Other way to have fun is travelling , most adults like to travel and meet other people .
For instance , my mother is a person who likes to travel a lot and I always go with her , I enjoy it too but I know thats the way my mother enjoys her life .

Something that is very common is that adults lay on their beds and watch television and they seem to enjoy it , even though some people find it boring .

In conclusion , I think that younger people enjoys life more because there are more moments of happiness while they are children and teenagers .
They have fun in easier ways than older people .
Therefore , in my point of view , children and teenagers enjoy more their life .
