I do agree with the statement , but i can not be completely sure about it .
It is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before .
Also the polution shows a lot of economical and enviromental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using the cars because of their leck of usefulness in the cities .

Oil prices is a principal problem for western countries which have n't their own oil supplies .
For example in europe , it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes , insurances and enormous fuel costs .
Also the leck of space in major cities make the price rise up .
One can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe , e.g. the goverment in Vienna is making biking routs in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its habitants .
Holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car .
A city designer in London said that cars should n't design the city .
He meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans .
This statement has its truth , when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones .
European cities have a natural structure .
The old parts mostly the centers are n't designed for cars but more for humans .
American cities like Caracas they have major problems with mobility of humans .
Of course they have a metro but the cars made formed the appearance of the city .
They have in the middle of the city big highways and it is completely impossible to walk from one point to the other .
