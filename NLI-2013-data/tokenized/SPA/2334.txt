There are several reasons why it is believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Because of their freedom recentely discoverd and the amazing and new oportunities that keep appearing all the time .
Because of this time of exploration that youth has , I can affirm that young people enjoy life more than older people .

Young people feel free to do what they want .
They are in a period of discovering new things and finding out their path and knowing who they really are .
Because old people have already established a life style , with bigger responsabilities , they are not especting anything and their experimental time has passed .

Nevertheless , older people have their own wat to enjoy life , but I can not tell it because I have not experimented the adult period yet .
As a youth , I can affirm that I enjoy life because I take advantage of every new adventure that came out , and I dont have much bigger responsabilities than university .
In addition , university is enjoyable when you learn and at the same time , make friends and have fun with them .
It is the time in which you share your moments of joy with others .

Young people are independiently .
They have the wings to fly werever they want , travell in and outside the country , work in different places only for experience and not because of financial needs .
Youngs aspire for the future and project themself , so they still have hopes and views , and live their life especting and enjoying .

However , not all youngs have a pleasent life .
There are young people in the streets , homeless , and definetely not enjoying life as many other youths .

In conclussion , the adolecense period is fun , but the truth is that each period has their benefits .
Old people find their way to enjoy life too , as well as kids and babies .
The key is in enjoying every moment , because the present is a gift called present .
