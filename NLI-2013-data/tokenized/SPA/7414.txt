The first thing we need to know when we are going to travel is to having fun and enjoy ourselfs , because if we going to a place and know it the essencial thing we need to know is that the preocupations are out of our mind .
We go there to travel and have fun not to remain the problem and how to solve it .

If we going to relax and forgot about the world and all the people , the best situation is to go alone so we can enjoy and at the same time relax our minds but if our porpouse is to meet new people , new places and learn new things the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide that explain us the different things the city or country has and at the same time let us know about their costumes , their country or city and enjoy ourselfs learning about them .

I agree with the statement because if we are going to travel we need to meet new people , new cultures and understand that in the world exist different kinds of people that thinks in a different way than us so it help people to have a good relationship with the others and liberate theirselfs of the routine that involve them all the time and in every moment .

When we travel with other people our mood and feelings changes a lot , our lifes take a new way and the things we think are incorrect turn into a different way ; the people start seeing you differently and knowing at the same time your costumes , culture and way of thinking that make you different form the others .

That type of travel help you to leave the problems , relax yourself and look the life in another way and with other thoughts .

Enjoy the life is the best form of live happy and extend our life because liberate our minds and at the same time make us happy people , full of good and interesting things that the others could know and learn about us knowing that the life is not compose of work and responsability , it can be complement with fun and happiness .
