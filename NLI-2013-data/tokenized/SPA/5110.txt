Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , I personally agree with this statement because the companies developes advertisements in order to sale and it implies many times lie about the product .

The companies developes advertisements in order to sale and it implies , many times , lie about the quality and advantages of this product and the product brings many people who is dissapointed about it .
The companies do not aware about the risk of this item because the company could lose many profits and also people could demand them for this .

Furthermore , the companies which develope the advertisement should have a rule in order to control the quality of product because they could be demanded also for this item .
I think that is an ethic problem , the companies should have ethical classes in order to avoid this behavior .

Many companies have a lot of Quality measures in order to avoid this problems , for example , a company which develope make up have a lot of test before the product was saled , this is due to the make up could causes many problems in the skin such as allergy reactions or eruptions .
Moreover a company which developes medicines must to be very carefull testing the products before the sale .
However I think the most of the make up producers lie about the advantages of their products because they have to overrate the product in order to be saled .

Finally , I think that the customers should demand any time they buy something which is saled as a wonderfull thing and it is not a wonderfull thing because with this measures we can stop the companies which announce the best products and they are not .
We should demand also the advertisement companies because they do not have ethical values .
