Education is not only the reason people get hired everyday for different types of job , it is also a way of life .
To decide whether it 's better to specialize in a subject than to learn about many subjects is a lifetime decision .
Depending on the person and his/her aspirations , his/her decision about specialization will be taken .

I 'm more of a specialized person .
I prefer to learn a lot about an interesting subject for me than to learn about many other subjects that may be not so relevant for my taste .
In my future , I expect to become a proffesional astronomer .
Since I was young , I 've known that there 's no way for me to become an astronomer if I do n't specialize in astronomy and physics .
If I wanted to become an astronomer and also have broad knowledge of many other academic subjects , I 'll forever be a college student .
Maybe that does n't sound that bad , does n't it ?
But I would also like to raise a family and maybe , being a college student all my life is not going to help me in taking care of my kids .

In contrast with being an astronomer , there 's a proffesion that requires a broad knowlege about many subjects : teachers .
The teachers are like second parents to any son or daughter who gets enrolled in an academic program .
And maybe teachers are divided into types of classes given , but a great teacher is the one that knows about everything .
Sure you can learn about math from your calculus teacher but , what about a little history ?
Would n't that be great ?
If a person decides to become a teacher , this person must be determined to study about many subjects and not just one .

Another example of broad knowledge is our grandfathers and great-grandfathers .
What we have today is because of them .
And most of them were n't specialized in a subject ; they knew something about everything .
They are the reason our parents are here and our parents are the reason why we are here .
Maybe if all our grandfathers had some sort of specialization , our lifes would have been completely different .
So , in a way , people with broad knowledge were the founders of our society .

But during this times , there 's space for everyone .
You can specialize in a subject or not .
The key is to decide what do you want for your life and to remember that everyone is different : I may be a specialized person , maybe you are n't .
But we all are capable of learning and success only depends on effort , no matter what type of education is chosen .
