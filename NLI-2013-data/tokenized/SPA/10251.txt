I agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather that only doing what they already know how to do well .
When you try new things your brain is working harder .
If you take new chances that means your are an enthusiastic an positive person .
I 'm trying to study a masters in law in a New York City University , so I 'm risking not only to deal with another language but also studying a new legal system .

Let 's assume I can work in another job that is not legal such as be a Court Interpreter and make good money .
I can work as a Legal interpreter but I 'm a lawyer in my country , so why not risk and become what I love the most which is to practice law .
At the beginning I was afraid because it is a new language for me , a new legal system really different from my country which is common law .
But I 'm a capable person , enthusiatic and energetic .
I 'm trying to learn new things that I will .
Succes for me means to try new things does n't matter how much they will take you to achieve .
Generally people just prefered to do what already know because is easier and sometimes puts them is a better position not try harder .

It 's difficult to try new things but if you can accomplish your goals in your life generally you will be a succesful person .
Always make your best as a person that is learning every day .
