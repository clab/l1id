I disagree with the stament that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Life is becoming shorter every day .
Time is everything and every minute is worth a fortune .
People have more things to do , much more responsibilities and activities to perform within society .
Work demands more every day that goes by , and productivity is an every day word in our vocabulary .
New inventions and equipment is constantly being created to help people save time and energy .
Time flies and we keep flying behind it trying to catch up .

A car is one of the most important inventions that save us time and energy .
It is the basic main of transportation in this world of instant results .
Regardless the fact that is also a luxury and a pleasure to some people , it 's main purpose is to take us to a specific place in the less amount of time possible .

That is the basic reason why I believe that the amount of cars will keep increasing in the next several years .
However , I do think that the size of the cars is going to change .
Vehicles will become smaller and more compact .
So that there can be more space in the streets .
The car will no longer be seen as a luxury or an object of comfort but as a practical machine that saves us time , just as a computer or a calculator does .

I strongly believe that the amount of cars will not decrease twenty years from now , on the contrary I think the car population will increase more and more , but a car will no longer be seen as it has been these past years .
It will be a necessary instrument of our every-day life , like a toothbrush or a refrigerator .
It will prevail and be even more popular .
It will become smaller and more practical , more economic and less exclusive .
Looks will be a secondary thing while economy , space saving and good performance will be the main characteristics to be considered within the next decades .
The car will stay with us as long as no other machine takes it 's place .
