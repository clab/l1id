The success of a person is only measured on a just way by himself .
If it is not a persons priority to live in luxury but with knowledge we ca n't assume he is not successful if he does not have a big house and a big SUV .
We can acknowledge that he has had success in his life because he reached his goals .

Even so , it is my belief that people that succeed in their goals are people that have to , on some circumstances , take the risk and play their chances to what they believe in .
If you do only what you know what to do well , you will only do what you were taught .
And you wo n't stand out from the rest and succeed if you do only what everyone does .

People follow patterns in their everyday lives .
Many even have routines and feel secure with them , but the key to succeed in life is to take risks when you have to and play to your strenghts .

Not everyone is the same in attitudes and experiences , but the fact that someone has knowledge and information equal to that which we possess is a possibility , the difference comes to what we decide to do with what everyone knows and what makes you special .

When we try to leave possitive mark in the world and its inhabitants day by day , we are succeeding on a level of moral fiber and character .
Then , that kind of success will translate into a series of events that lead to what we chose when we decided what we would do with our lives .

Its hard to fail and believe that we have not succeded , we are forced to believe that because we failed some prototype imprinted to us by someone or something , but if we are really whole and concient people , we will see that to fail to ourselves is the only way to fail in life .

Money , fame and women are n't success unless you want to think so that way .
Media gives us a vision of of what is according to them a true successful life , but it is we who make the choice of what to believe .
Success innovates , success creates , but more than anything , success gives you peace and interior calm .
