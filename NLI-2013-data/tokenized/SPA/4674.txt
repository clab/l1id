In our days , we can find many product to buy .
Some of those products are very usefull , or make life easier ( like tools , clothes , and so on ) , but other products are not so important .
Besides , now there are many companies that are making the same product , so they need to compete in how they can win the preference of the people .
That 's why advertisements needs to show the qualities of a product , to make feel the buyer that one specific product is the best one that he or she can find .
But most of the time , they show the product much better that it is .

One example of these is a cleaner product .
A company creates a new detergent that , with the power of special `` air-beads '' , can make your clothe to seen whiter .
They are going to charge you more money because of these new air-bead , but the true is that the old detergent that is been in the market for so long is doing the same thing , only that they not invented the fancy name of `` air beads '' .
So , the power of advertisement can make you buy this new product , because you think is better , but in the end is doing the same think that your old detergent did .

Another example coud be a sports drink .
In a tv commercial they show that the person who drinks it fells so much better , with more energy ; now , he can run faster without felling tired .
But these new drink is only rehydrateting the body , and is not giving you more energy .

The life today is very different than the life that our grandparenths had .
The materialism is everywhere and that means that now you can buy many different prducts .
So the companies have to show that their products are the best , and the way to do it is with advertisements .
Maybe the difference between a X-sport drink and the Y one is not so important , But a colorful or melodic commercial can makes the difference in the moment the buyer decides wich product to buy .
