I agree with the statement that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As a matter of fact , I believe that this is precisely the whole purpose of advertising : convincing potential consumers of the good qualities or advantages of a specific product or item .
It is the ultimate goal that the consumer , buyer , or customer does what is being recommended in the ad .

Unfortunately , people in advertisement business may use all sort of techniques to sound convincing and be effective , which goes from mentioning only good qualities - and exclude those which are not so good - to emphasizing the bad qualities of alternative products or services .
For example , any shampoo advertisement will claim that it will make hair get shinier , glossier , and easy to handle in , probably `` no time '' .
Is it true ?
If we carried out a research to classify hair products ( just to choose any product ) into those which are effective and those which are not , we would probably end up with a ration of 1 to 9 .
For one effective shampoo , there are 9 which `` claim '' to be but they are not .

As consumers , advertisements have made us less gullible and more alert , as well as more careful when we make decisions on the basis of impressions created by advertisements .
By making a comparison , advertisements are similar to the reflection on a rear-view mirror , reason why a sticker reads `` objects in rear view mirror are closer than they appear '' .
We need to widen the use of this statement to many other contexts .

I personally think that , although there are regulations to control the advertising business in terms of using true/untrue statements and claiming results that they do n't actually deliver and sometimes even cause others , there is a strong need for further more-detailed regulations regarding the use of misleading techniques which make consumers make wrong decisions .
Consumers should be better protected because most advertisements use questionable technoques which manipulate the truth and that is dishonesty .
