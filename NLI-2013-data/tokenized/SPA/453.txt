The question of whether it is better to have little knowledge in lots of subjects , or to have lots of knowledge in a specific subject , has been a theme of discussions for many years , specially for students .
I personally agree with the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , but only up to a certain point .

If a person has broad knowledge of many subjects , he will be able to talk to other people about this subjects and develope a conversation about the topic .
If the person has knowledge in only one subject , he will only be able to develop conversations about that specific subject , therefore there will be less people he will be able to talk to .
Also , a person with a broad knowledge in many subject can be seen as a better overall prepared and informed person .
He could be able to understand news , for instance , better than a person who does n't know what 's being talked about because it 's not his subject .

On the other hand , specialized knowledge has its advantages .
In a job interview for a specific carreer , for example , the person with more knowledge in the area will definetely be chosen over the person with less knowledge in the area and more overall knowledge .
Thus the specialized knowledge guy can make a better living .
Also with more knowlegde on a specific subject you can discuss the subject with another person in , just about , all possible details .

As we can see , both statements have their pros and contras .
My personal opinion and recomendation to anyone is to have both : a broad knowledge in many subjects and lots of knowledge in a specific one .
If so , you can defend yourself in any subject and be the best you can be in a particular one .
That 's also why I agree with the school systems that teach broad knowledge in many subjects up to a certain point of maturity , or level reached , and then let one decide in what subject one wants to specialize .
I think it is the best way to prepare people to live in such a complex society , like the one we live in today .
