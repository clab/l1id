Nowadays , only few people take risks .
This happens because everybody to be sure that what they are doing will be successful .
The problem with this approach is that if a person do n't take risk , the benefits are the same as the average .

One example of risk are sports , the mayority of persons that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individuals usually not only win one competition but a lots .
These ones are successful in reaching their goal not because they know what it was , but because they have trained to the limits of their body and went beyond them .
This approach is the correct to success in life .

This teach us that in order to success a person has to know what is the goal he wants to achieve .
After that , this individual has to understand the path he has to follow to get this goal .
Because a lot of people should be looking for this goal and following the same steps , it is important to stand out of the crowd .
This is where innovation takes part of it .

Persons need to know that even if is well known paths all people advices you to follow , it is important to also know there are other unexplored roads to take .

In my life I have experience some situations that have helped me to understand this , for example , I had the same job for about three years , and I was sure it was doing in right because I always did everything my boss told me to .
I get a raise once but never was promoted , which was my goal .
So , after three years I changed my attitude and start to participate more in the projects , I got involved more in my co-workers ' tasks and working more hours I they ask me to , after two months I was promoted .

In conclusion , it is important to take risks to stand of the crowd , if you do n't do it , you just have the average results everybody can get .
In order to be successful a person has to know that hardwork pays .
