The human knowledge can be formed by different topics , subjects , expiriences , memories and very important ; by many academic subjects .
Then , if we are able to broad knoledge of many academic subjects , why to specialize in one specific subject ? .
On the one hand , when people often specialize only in one specific subject their basic knowledge is , obviously , going to be all about that specific subject .
But , in the other hand thos who learn many subjects , and do not focus only in one , in my opinion are the ones who are closer to succes .
I am going to support my opinion with two ordinary and essential examples .

First , in our ordinary lifes we are expose to many different situations and expiriences , which we do not know if those are going to be easy or difficult to handle .
For example , an ordinary conversation with your parter can be easy , but if you are talking to your boss you have to be prepared by having the necessary knowledge in a variety of different subjects .
For this reason , we have to be prepared and to have all the necessary knowledge to be ready to defend any topic or subject that we are expose .
By knowing all the information about only one subject will not help you to escape of a problem if it is based in another subject .

Second , the fact of wanting to be a good professional gives you chance to work in many different areas .
For example , these are can be : bussiness , advertising , laws , and many more .
So , if you are specialize only one subject gives you limites .
In contrast , if you are well prepared with knowledge of different subjects you are able to establish a conversation in any topic .

In conclusion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , than to specialize in one specific subjest .
For the reason that it makes you a prepared person in every way .
