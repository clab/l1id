For an estudent , it 's important to learn facts and also to undestand ideas and concept .

But , I totaly agree with the statement that is more important to students to understand the concepts , than is for the to learn the facts .
I think this way , mainly because by understanting the concepts and ideas , you are really getting the basis of knowlege ( you can go to the deeps of it ) .
It 's the only way to go to the bottom on the issues .
If you just learn a memorize the facts ( and leave the undestanding of concepts behind ) , you wo n't be able to innovate .

I think facts are the starting point .
By revising and questioning those facts and working based on them , knowing their cause and effect is the key .
The only way to do this , is by the understanting of the ideas and concepts that lead to those facts .
In other words , If you just learn the facts and do n't know where the came from , you wo n't be a complete all-arround student , just memorizing machine .

The great human minds over the course of history , have been well knowned for understanding the ideas they worked on .
Albert Einstein once said : `` you realy do n't know something , until you 're able to explaining it to your grandmother ... '' , meaning that the only way teach something in a way anyone can follow , is putting it in simple form .
The way to achive this , is by dominating the concepts and ideas well ( knowing where they come from , so you can put it in different words ) .
Try to picture Einstin explaning to his grandmother one of his teories , just giving her the facts ...

In resume , undestanding the ideas and concepts ( what they really mean , where they come from , ect . )
is by far more important tha just learning the facts .
Facts are important , but no
