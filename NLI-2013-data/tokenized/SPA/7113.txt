Different studies and investigations have been proving during years , how contaminating a car is .
However the number of cars continues to increase at time passes by .
In fact , I am not an expert in the subject , but I would say I disagree with the statement listed and predict an increase of cars in the following twenty years .

In the fisrt place , simply because the world 's population is growing .
People are having more and more children , and those children get to be adults who can buy their own cars .
Therefore , if the percentage of car owners stay constant , the number of cars will increase .
For example , if the percentage of car owner is 10 % , and nowadays the population is 100 people , and in the futur this population grows to 120 people , then the number of cars would pass from 10 to 12 .

The second reason I can find to hold my opinion is very much related with the first one .
Since population is growing there are no more space for everyone in the cities , and , thus , living in the city is becoming more and more expensive .
Therefore , nowadays one can choose to have a more cheaper and calm life in the outskirts of the city , and in that way one is able to buy a car and travel to the city to work everyday .

In the third place , I think there is an economical reason for which the number of cars will increase .
Manufacturing tecnhiques are improving , making the construction of a car simpler and cheaper , which makes the final product much more cheaper and accesible .
For example in my grandparent 's time having a car in Argentina was a real privilege for cars were luxury products .
Today , on the contrary , though not everyone can have a car , most of middle class people in Argentina can afford one .

However I also think that there are many different ways in which the number of cars can be regulated .
In my opinion each government should find it 's own way to incentivating people to use alternate means of transportation such as buses or subways to reduce the number of cars .
Clearly the process is not easy but if nothing is done , and the number of cars keeps increasing , then the contamination caused would be really terrible and impossible to correct .

In conclusion I think that if things keep on being the way they are today , in twenty years the number of cars will not be reduced but increased .
Population growth , their need to move out of the cities and to move themselves daily , and the prices on cars are just some reasons I can find to predict such increase .
However , this increase can be reversed if action , mainly form the governments , is taken to regulate the numbers of cars .
