Imagine walking through the Costa Rican tropical forest with one 's closest friends .
As you march through the various types of plants and life-forms , you encounter the rarest type of bird in all of Costa Rica : the `` Mancha Roja '' .
Its astounding colors amaze you and you 're friends to such a point that you become frozen on the spot .
Such a scene would not be frequently seen with the structured group tours guided by an expert .
It is obvious that when one drifts away from the traditional ideas and creates one 's own pathways , one will discover new and amazing things that would have otherwise been hidden .

If one does not separate from the typical behavior produced by human nature , society would still be living under medieval age conditions and no true discoveries would be made .
It is essential to think outside the box in order to get the best from an experience .
If one uses a tour guide to explore and discover the riches of our world , one will not be truly discovering the hidden treasures but instead be following a simple lesson .
If that is what one truly seeks , then maybe a textbook would be more cost-efficient than an expensive tour guide .
With this conservative attitude of following someone around , Thomas Alva Edison would not have discovered the lightbulb , or the Wright brothers would not have soared in the skies .
In order to see the unseen , it is key to make one 's own path and explore , try new things and base one 's opinion and thinking upon that , rather than on a tour guide that one does n't even know .
Going back to the initial example of the mysterious bird , if one had walked along the amazon with a group of people , that bird might have been scared away by unfamiliar noises .
One would have missed out on what could have been the most enlightening and fabulous experience of years of exploration .
Had one gone along the inexistent path , one might have seen this bird along with many other incredible animals , therefore the pre-written path does not lead to discovery and hence must not be followed .

Creating our own paths in life is absolutely vital to the enrichment of our minds .
Following a group , led by a tour guide , into the unknown cannot even be compared to the experience of entering the unknown without direction or expectations .
Without a doubt , the best way to travel is , and always will be , traveling through the rugged , virgin and unexplored paths .
