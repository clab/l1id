Most people like doing what they are used to , what they have learned from their family and society over the passed years .
This is a good way of living to avoid making any mistakes , and to keep things the traditional way .
But the trueth is , only a few people are the ones that take risks in life and make a difference .

People openminded , who enjoy exploring and trying new things are the ones who take risks , encourage themselves to try uncommon things and see things in another perspective .
This kind of people most of the time find success ; however , some find may it after their death .
An example of this would be the famous artist Vincent Van Vough .
He was a pioneer in a new painting technique ; he was a great paintor whose work did not have much importance when he was alive .
But it was after his death that his work rechead the value it had hidden , and it became famous .

An example of a successful person who had reccodmission while alive was the Pope John Paul II .
He was a brilliant man , that accomplished to do many activities that were not tipically done by a Pope .
He was the first one that have ever gone to almost every country in the world and he spoke several languages that helped him through all his trips .
His charisma was unique , and because of this characteristic he could stablish a sense of brotherhood between Catholics and other religions members .

Successful people are also good role models , not only for young people but to adults too .
They show another way of living , probably a more difficult one , but its results are not represeable .

I believe that not all humans are destinated to have success , but everybody can try new things .
It just needs determination and hard work .
