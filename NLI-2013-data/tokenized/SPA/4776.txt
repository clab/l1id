Advertisements make products seem better than they really are , and there 's a reason for that .

Most of the times , advertising is used to help a company sell it 's product .
In order to do this , advertisements use several techniques .

One of this techniques is to make the product look as good as it can , this usually involves a lot of lying in the process .
A good example for this are cereal advertisements .
In these advertisements , the ceral always looks crunchy and perfectly placed over the milk , even though , in real life it eventually sinks and becomes soggy .
Several tricks are involved in these situations like replacing the milk for glue or some other , more gooey , white , milklike material .

Another technique is to present the product in a collectively idealized hypothetic situation .
This situation is usually full of sexual content , either explicit or symbolic .
A car advertisement in which a good looking , sexy woman is either in the car or over it is one of the biggest cliches in car advertising , yet , it works and continues to be used because of this .
The woman does n't make the car better in any way , but it makes the viewer associate the car with beautiful women and eventually with sexual intercourse .
This makes the car way more attractive .

Symbolism is another very efficient technique mused in advertising .
Phalic symbols are used for products directet to a male-based market , and more femenine , virginal symbols are used for women .
For example , the use of fruits and flowers as a femenine symbol to sell beauty products .

Finally , the use of color .
Color is one of the most important things in anvertising .
Color creates an unconcsious reaction in the viewer .
Green for example , depending on the way it 's used can mean extreme joy or extreme sadness .
Black usually reflects power , it 's usually used to sell expensive cars to men .

Advertising , as it has been proved , does n't just make a product look and seem better than it really is , it 's planned out to be that way .
It is the beauty of it , it turns it into a form of art .
