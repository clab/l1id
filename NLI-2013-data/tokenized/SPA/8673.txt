For sure im totally agree with that statement , in adition to that i will explain why for two points of viewing , one personal and another more objective ; I remember long time ago , when i was studing a elemental school all teachers were making us to stock in our memory useless data , names and another crappy stuff that nowadays i still not using .

Now im a Physic , and the most part of my personal world is ruled by mathematical laws , equallities , operators and overwhelming logic .
I know this things cause my college professors taught me to smart-thinking by making me undertanding all from the basics , i.e : nothing about memmory but yes in understanding .
This was a brief and personal explanaiton of why i am totally agree with the statement , now i will focus on reasons and examples to support my answer .
Firstly , facts are of course useless if it have not a concept or idea within ( Newton and the apple falling is a ridiculous fact if Newton wasnt explained all with his Newtonian Mechanics theory , when we see that exists a force field called gravity ) .

Of course facts are sometimes funny o funniest than an explanation of a concept , but talking in terms of use or importance , concepts wins .
Imagine an example of a sciences student , to be more accurate a biology one ; in the college a professor says to his students that human body is made from water and carbon basically , its ok , but this is only a fact that contains only a partial true .
The idea of the human body is the community of a lot of organisms living together to mutual advantage that are called cells , of course these cells are made of water and carbon , but that is only the fact that a lot of living units conforming the human body are chemical composed by water and carbon , the idea is that carbon and water could create different types of microscopic structures depending on his molecular structure giving place to the formation of cells .

Well , if the student only knew that human body is made of carbon and water , nowadays organ transplants would be impossible , a lot of modern medical threatments also would be imposible , genetic therapy also would be impossible too , only cause we knew a partial true instead the big one .
