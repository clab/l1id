I agree withe the statement , I believe that young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
I think that innocent , ignorant and worry free young individuals do enjoy life more that experienced , learned and concerned adults do .

Once we are born we have no worries , in fact new born babies do not know anything about their environment , they are totaly innocent exposed individuals at the mercy of well , adults , who care for them .
If there were no concerned adults who had to care for the feeding , care and well being of those children , humanity as we know it would not exist .
It is a natural thing , babies eat and cry whenever they 're hungy and adults provide nurishment and care for them .

Ignorance is bliss some poeple say , and you know what , I actually think they are right .
Once you are ignorant , meaning do n't know of something you do n't worry about it , for example .
If I have never heard about cancer or diabetes I will probably not wory about it , as in the old ages where they believed it was some illness caused by spirits or demonds , but once I know about I can cut of the sugar in the case of a diabetic or have chemo or radiation for cancer and worry about it .
Adults know about responsabilities , about money , about safety and all the possible outcomes of a certain situation .
Kids do n't , it is actually a kids job to have fun , and it is an adults job to marvel at that miracle of joy that bursts from every childs new discovery .

Some poeple might say that older people enjoy life more because they know that there will be few moments that you can actually enjoy , but , how is it possible to enjoy more than a young child who has no idea of hardship or sorrow ?

Life is a wonderful thing as the song `` I 've got the world on a string '' says , but it also says `` As long as I hold on to the string '' .
As adults , we can never predict when that string will leave our finger .
While young people , babies , kids in general dont even know that it is they , who actually hold the whole world , and our destiny in their tiny little hands .
