Well , i think that the statement has 2 ponits of view , i i can assure you because of my personal life experience with my acttual own business .

The First Point of view

Like Donald Trumph there are many people that take new risk in business ( for instance ) and start campaings totally diferent that usuall .
Donal is a Real State business man , a constructor developer , a golf court owner , and recently a TV host with the Apprentice !

So he try to do the best in many areas , obviuosly very well researched , because when you have success you leanr some rules that teach how to be on top allways no matter what , por example :
a. Think possitive b. Fail is good , because you learn from it c. You allways have to be surrounded by people smatest than you , in order to make a team that helps you achieve your goals .
d. You have to serve ALLWAYS , because you are a person who works for the people and that people is the one that give you the success .
e. You have to be a visionare or a pioneer , and see what other ca n't see to help the society grew up .

Well as you see my point of view is like the business side because i like it and i know a lot .

The Second Point of view

BUT in the other hand , my own experience teach me that if i get lazy and sleeps on my success i can not do new things because i allways be waiting the same success from the same source and keep all my risk down , because i `` think '' i 've got the FOREVER formula and try to stay in my status quo .

In sumary , i think that the human been that is successful , have to probe him self that he CAN DO IT in other areas different in order to stay alert and grew up in knowledge , perfection and happiness .

Thanks
