We live in a big and diverse world , and the only way to know it , learn about its different cultures and participate in new experiences is by traveling .
Travelling needs to be done with enough preparation and interest so the trip results in a pleasant one .
Therefore , I think that the best way to travel is without a tour guide because it helps you to experiment a different culture , get in contact with the people that live in that place and experiment real relaxation .

First , I think that travelling without a tour guide and helps you experiment a different culture .
Tour guides mostly focus on turistic places , places where large crowds of people prowl and it is almost impossible to find a quiet place to observe the beauthiful attractions that place offers .
So , if travelling consists of hanging with crowds of people I better stay home and go to the stadium .

Second , when travelling all by yourself you get the chance to get in contact with the local people , an experience that cannot be compared .
Travelling consists not only watching but experimenting different cultures .
When you travel you must take the time to learn about local people and it customs .
Therfore I cant think of a better way of getting aquainted with another culture than by travelling all by yourself , visiting exotic cities and talking to old people that were born and would die in the place you are visiting .

Third , by travelling without a tour guide you can really relax by doing what you please when you please .
When you are travelling with more people and led by a tour guide , it is rare the ocassion you can do what you want , you must always keep with the group .
To all the places you go , there will always be the sound of people joking and laughing making it impossible to relax .
So , travelling in a group ca n't be called a holiday .

Travelling is a privilege that here in Ecuador few people can afford , but when someone decides to travel , I think he must always do it without a tour guide .
When traveling on your own you should consider your ability to dont get lost and reach places with a map as your only guide .
But I strongly recommend people to take the risk because at the end , the experience adquired is unforgettable and it will always compense the hours spent looking for a place that in the map seemed very easy to get .
