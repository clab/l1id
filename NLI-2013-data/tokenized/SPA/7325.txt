Regarding the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' I think it depends on the situation and the country or place where you are going .

Traveling deals with a lot of things like : language , culture , nature , weather , kind of inhabitants , available time , etc. and for every case it coulbe a different oppinion about the statement .
For instance if I 'm in China probably I will prefer to be guided by a skilled tour guide , otherwise anybody can get lost , but if I 'm going to an European Country in that case I will prefer to go on my own .
Time is also important if you have little time for traveling then an experienced guide will be very heplfull to know as much as possible in short time .

Regarding groups , if you are with a group where you do n't know anybody it will be very different experience if you know all of the people in the group very well , like in a football team or schoolmates .
On the other hand , if your intention is to know new people in the place you are visiting , then traveling alone it could be an advantage .

Other important factor to consider is the reason or the final intention of the travel .
For instance , if you are traveling to rest and be away of noise , to have a time for yourself or , on the contrary , you are willing to know new places , people and cities .
In both cases , the group or the guide is a big difference .

As explained , it is necessary to take a lot of things into account before to agree or disagree with such general statement , but if I have the oppotunity to travel , I will prefer to go to Europe in a group and without tour guide , in this case I do n't agree with the statement .
