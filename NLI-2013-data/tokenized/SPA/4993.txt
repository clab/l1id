Marketing is an activity that has grown fast and steady for the last few decades .
Some argue that it is exclusively a lucrative , almost an inmoral activity .
Others regard it as creative and valuable as art .

Probably the fact that has been critisized more convincingly is the fact that advertisers tend to overstate the qualities of a product in order to sell it .
People who make such kind of statements , as the one presented above , are convinced that marketing is the exclusive art of embellishing reality and lying about it , since it presents a product that is not quite what is promised to the consumer .
And of course almost everyone has suffered a huge dissappointment when buying for example a tooth paste that does NOT whiten the teeth in five seconds , as it was stated in the package , or when noticing that a package of regular batteries last the same or more than the ones the bunny said would last forever .

I believe , every proffesion is susceptible to human vices .
Lying is therefore not exclusive of advertrisers , nor is it characteristic of them .
I think there are , of course , advertisers who will be willing to sell any product regardless of it is something benign for society or not , or if it is actually the product they are promising to consumers .
Nonetheless , these events occur in almost every proffession , accountants that do not pay their costumers taxes , drivers that drive unsafely , real estators who sell damaged or overprized properties .
So , the fact that some people will want to take advantage of other people is present wherever thers is interaction between human beings .
The only thing we can do about it , is to rely on ethical grounds and hope that eveveryone will perform the job they are expected to in the most honest manner .
