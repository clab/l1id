Refering to the statement I believe thet it 's very complex to find the real difference between the two of them .
I have some important reasons to think like that .
I 'm also student on the univesity actually and my experience is that there are two kinds of students .
One that not use to go to class and try to study all the book during the week before .
And second there is the student that always goes to class and take notes so that 's why when he has the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book .

However , both of them use to pass the exam but using diferrent ways .
The method of study is as important as the way that you practice to memorice the ideas or facts .

From my point of view it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In order to explain this I will give an example .

- Imagine a situation with a student learning a complex theme of antropology at university four years ago .
It 's not equal if he had studied the theme by understanding the main ideas instead of learning facts .
Be sure that he will remember perfectly if he had undestanded the idea during that class .
I believe that facts are confusing according to my experience .

In conclussion , the difference between learning and understanding really does n't matter in my opinion , the important point is that with both of them the student is learning even facts or ideas that he will use on the future maybe working or teaching other students .
So depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one .
