In order to sell a product the first thing you have to do is advertise it , to make it known by the people , otherwise they product wo n't be sold , does n't matter if it is good or bad .
In the next paragraphs I am going to explain why I consider advertisement make products seem much better than they actually are and why companies do this .

First , we have to consider the subject of Advertisement as a branch or subdivision of Marketing , in other words Marketing uses Advertisement to promote the product or service the company trades .
In order to make the product popular , the marketers , publicists and publicity companies have to make the product very attractive sometimes over highlighting the product 's features and benefits .
Sometimes they create multimillonaire campaigns to promote products that are not necessarilly the best in the market .
For example in Eastern Europe a couple of years ago , they make a very big promotional campaign for one car , the Dacia .
The ads said that is was a cheap car , the `` car for the people '' they stated , that is was very economic , that have a traditional european design and that it will be the best deal for families and young people .
What they did n't mention was that altough its nice exterior design , the interior was very poor and cheap , and even more serious , that car needed a lot of visits to the mechanic after the first 100.000 miles .
As a result a lot of people was unsatisfied and agry with the company that told them that was the best option around .

Furthemore , when we consider advertising to make products look good , we just have to watch the tv commercials , or the internet where companies promote their products in a very glamourous way sometimes .
We can see beautiful models , actors or actresses talking about a product or service that is not really as good as it seems .
For instance , recently a friend of mine was interested in a computer he saw on the internet , the design seemed very nice , with a wide screem and a lot of software installed .
After a few months the operating system stopped working well and that computer did n't come with the original system back up disks , so he have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed to the same company that sold it to him .

As a conclusions , nowadays in the market we can find a very wide range of products that seem to be perfect and that last forever .
The true is that is not always the case and we always have to try something before we buy it in order to verify what the seller promesses just to sell more units .
