Some people in the world , may be in poor countries dislike to understand ideas and concepts , but they prefer to learn facts .

I do n't agree with this statement , because the real sense of the life is in the facts .

For example :

It is more important for a fisher understand how find a fish , or it is more important for he swim in the rivers or sea and became to know how is phylosophy of fish , I think the fisher should be firts a good swimer , and he only will obtain good results in his work with practice , with facts .

But it is also important understand ideas of how working the things , Because if We do not study first the world can not know the facts .

For example , the same fisher will obtain best results in his work , if He first will study how is the behavior of the fishes , in Which kind of water , the fishes grown faster .

Other example , The farmers cultivated a lot of years ago , without our tecnology and knowlodge .

How Did They cultivate it ?
There is a only answer , with facts , with practice .

So , If the farmers cultivated with more ideas , with more knowledge , theirs results will be best .

How did Child learn to speak ?
He do not learn with to understand ideas and concepts , he learn with facts .

In the progress countries , there are some people thinking that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

In conclussion , it is more importand for students learn facts , practice for learn , because this can use for them in their countries .
