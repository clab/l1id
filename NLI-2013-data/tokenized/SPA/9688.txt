Usually this statement is true now days , if you dont take a risk it is unlikely that you are going to change your current situation , obtaining a broader experience is a rich contribution to your overall performance in life .
However in my opinion i think that this has been true for only the last couple of years .

Decades ago , one would not see beyond what he nows , because achieving self preparations and richness was nearly imposible , much of the capital owned or techniques learned came from family heritage , the clever thing to do was to especialize yourself on what you best knew .

Now days the story has changed and generally someone who thinks out of the box and investigates on differtent areas , constitutes a succesful person .
This is not very ackward since our economy and social traits have had a tremendous shift .
aknowledging a vast array of skills will make you more efficient on your everyday life .
I think that this is true because now everithing is linked to one another , you may find many things that are related to your job but are not the base of your focus , this will force you to adapt to the problem in matter .

No longer duties only involve a very specific duty , but they require other skills because the scale in which things are done now , and the way communications have narrowed the world enable many things to interfeer with others .

In conclusion , been focused in one thing is clever as long as you dont require further learning on other areas .
A narrow mind will gain efficient results at a particular thing but will fail to absorb any other skills that may help him on the future .
In the long run a compensation of knowledge will outperform a narrow minded person .
