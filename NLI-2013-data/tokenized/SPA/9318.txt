Over the years , people have developed two very important theories about a student 's development .
Some will say that it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts and others will say that it is more important for them to learn facts .

Personally , I believe that both theories are important , but the understanding of ideas and concepts is the real key to a student 's success .
I say this because if a student just learns facts , that is all that they are learning , simple facts .
On the other hand , if a student learns to understand concepts and ideas , he or she is getting the tools to face all types of situations in school , university , job , and life itself .

A clear example of what I mention above are two friends that I grew up with , but graduated from different schools .
One of them graduated from a school where their principal objective was to teach the student how to think , analyze and understand concepts and ideas besides just teaching them facts and the other one came from a school where the main teaching technique was to make students memorize all types of information .
When the time to go to the university came , both students graduated from school with excellent grades but the difference among them started to show on the way .
The one that was used to learning and memorizing facts started to experience serious difficulties if things did n't work out exactly as they were supposed to , while the one trained to understand concepts and ideas found out how to work his way through the changes and experienced much better results .
Over the years , the student who was just taught facts saw the results that the other one was obataining and finally comprehended that he needed to change .
Once he did , things started working out much better for him .

I am sure that the example I mention above happens all the time all over the world .
Personally , I was lucky enough to be taught to understand concepts and ideas rather than just plain facts and I can assure that it has helped me a lot throughout my life because it has given me the tools to comprehend , understand and analyze things from different points of view , from different perspectives and to look for solutions when apparently ther are n't any , which you wo n't be able to do if you just learn facts .
