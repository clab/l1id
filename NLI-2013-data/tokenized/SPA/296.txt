I agree with this statement .
I do n't mean that facts and learning about them is not important .
But the complete understanding of something comes with the acknowledgement of its basis .
Ideas and concepts are the base in wich knowledge and progress are built on .
So it 's essential for a student to manage the ideas and concepts of a topic of study , to be capable of completely understanding everything about it and to work correctly with its facts .

When a student approaches his learning process , he must go through two moments .
First , the understanding of the basic concepts of the topic that he 's studying .
He must be able to manage and handle all the basic ideas and knowledge of what his studying .
And then analizyng the facts .
In this second moment the student , using his previous results , the student compares and associates the concepts and ideas he learned earlier with the facts that are given to him .
This way the student can fully learn about the topic and generate conclusion , that are correct and useful in his and in others whole educational process .

Teacher should point out process like these , so they could get much better results out of their teaching and could more accourately reach their goals .
And student could really be prepare and could really trust that they have a solid educational formation .

So in conclusion , it 's not that knowing about ideas and concepts is more important than knowing about facts .
Is that the proper learning of basic concepts can lead to a better use and to a better understanding of facts .
If students reallly want to reach a correct use of their knowledge , they must know everything about the concepts and ideas that they are working with .
And teachers must make their structure of teaching easier to point out the basics ideas .
