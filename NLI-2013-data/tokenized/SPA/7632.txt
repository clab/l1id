Travel is an excellent opportunity to know different cultures and also , is an opportunity to enjoy the life in different perspective that your habitual life .
In addition , travelling allows us to know a different people , habits and then different points of view .
Although traveling with a group led by a tour guide could be an excellent option to enjoy and relax , I prefer travel by myself with my family or friends .
This is for several reasons .

First , when you travel by yourself , you can decide the places that you want to visit , the time that you want to spend in each place , and the most important point you can save a lot of money .
For example , the last year when I traveled to Europe with my friends and my boyfriend , it was really enjoyable because we decided everything about our trip .
So , in only one month we visited eight different countries and it was unexpensive .

Second , travelling by yourself allows you to realize that you are able to do anything .
When you are travelling without guide , you have to be carefully if you do not want to lose .
In this case , this kind of trips helps us to be self-confidence in yourself , and to be open to ask to any person and then to meet a people from different countries .

Spending time with your friends or family , saving money and deciding all about places and times are my reasons to think that the best way to travel is by yourself .
