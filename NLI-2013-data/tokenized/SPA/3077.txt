Enjoying the life has nothing to do with age , as a matter of fact , I know people whose age would reflect no enjoying of life at all but that in the other hand demonstrates that enjoying life is better explained by the will to live .

Young people have misunderstandings about what enjoying the life really is .
Enjoying a day , enjoying a piece of cake , or just the blue of the skies and the evergreen threes of your house , enjoying the sensations we experiment within everyday , love , lust , sadness , etc. is sometimes more deligthful than trying to impress other ones by doing crazy things or by just leading to the drugs or alcohol that are nowadays commonly referenced as enjoying the life for young people .

Even enjoying life is not basically age determined , there are also situations on wich a person may have a tremendous physical or phsycological impediment that may result on being torn apart from the rejoycing of life , but even among these people once someone told me about a story where two sick people are on the same hospital room , but just one got the opportunity to see trough the window , so everyday , the one that had no possibility to see trough the window asked the other one to tell him about what was happening on the outer world .
With great level of detail the person near the window always used to tell about how nice was the weather outside , about how pretty was a young girl that most of the time used to pass by the street , and so on this man used to describe even the leaves from the threes that changed togheter with the seasons .
Unfortunately this man passed away and the other man unwilling to see anything requested to be changed to the bed near the window , and so it happened , but terrible and great at the same time was his surprise when he saw trough that window , and could just see a wall , a huge wall that made it impossible to see anything .
So harsh is this lecture that must help us to understand that enjoying life is up to one 's self , it has nothing to do with age , nor impediments , it is just a matter of will to live , desire to reach happiness .
