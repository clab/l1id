In every country we go , there is a large number of cars , but this figure will decrease in the future .
I think that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Nowadays there are so many cars in the world that we will be forced to abandon them in the future .
There are certain factors that I want to point out that will favour this decrease .

First of all , I think that it will be imposible for everyone to have a car .
The car prices but specially the petrol prices will go up steadily in the future : the fuel is going up and up everyday , but it will get worse as they become scarce .
Petrol prices are expensive now but they will be impossible to pay for a large number of people .

The pollution will be another factor that will decrease the number the cars in our streets .
We all have to be aware of the dangers of the pollution that cars produce .
The car smoke is one of the key factors of pollution in many countries .
In is important to bear in mind that we are damaging the planet and soon this damamge will become irreversible .

Also , in a more practical approach , traffic will act a deterrent for many car buyers in large cities .
In the future , it will be impossible to drive in the cities and more and more people will use the public transport .
Although there are many citizens using the public transport , it seems that figures will increase every year .

Regarding the public transport , citizens should put more pressure on government so they create an effective public transport network .
In my opinion , if this objective is accomplished , people would rely in the public transport and would abandon the need of the car .

In conclusion , I think that in twenty years there will be less cars in our streets than there are today .
I think that we will need to consider these points in order to use or not use our cars .
