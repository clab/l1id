I do not agree with the idea that successful people are the ones that try new things and take risks , instead of only doing what they already know how to do well .
There are several reasons that make me not agree with this statement , but I would like to concentrate in three of them .
Firstly , I do not believe that been a risk taker or an innovative person is a necessary condition to achieve success in life or your professional field .
In fact , every aspect of life ( interpersonal relations , family , labor relations , religion , social life ) and academic discipline , or professional field , require a different approach to succesffully interact and solve problems .

Secondly , taking risks might lead to failure .
Even though failing is not always negative , it represents an interruption on a task or process , which certainly causes delays on accomplishing a project 's goal or task .
Thus , incurring in activities or behaviors that involve high chances to fail will definetely not lead to success .

Lastly , it is important to considering that in fact , doing the same things leads you to specialization , which will make you an expert on doing something or in a specific field and probably a successful and well-known person in that particular area .
Opposite , it is really difficult for someone to do something new or an invention if he or she does not know the object or field .
This means that people require certain amount of knowledge and familiarity with a field or object to actually make a new thing that will deliver personal success .

I believe that the key to success is not hidden behind being the most original or risk taking person , but to actually get to know what you do .
Going deep into one activity , dealing with it in a daily basis will allow someone to achieve success .
