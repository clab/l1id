Success is desired by almost all the people .
In all aspects such as , school , work , and personal life , success is the main goal that every person would like to reach .

In order to reach success people may use different `` techniques '' such as : using their own experiences and / or knowledge , and taking into consideration other 's experiences .
But , it is important to use all the resources that may be near our possibilities and to find new ways to reach our goals .

In my own point of view , successful people reach success because they are open to new experiences and they take risks to achieve their goals .
But also I think they should be aware of what they are good at , taking into consideration their abilities and weaknesses so to pay more attention on what they can perform better in order to reach success in an easier way .

For instance , if a businessman is planning to open a company , it is more reliable that he performs better in an area where he has previous knowledge that in an unknown area .
A man that has studies in graphic design may open a design agency where he can offer his services based on knowledge he has obtained previously .
Additionaly , he can make his agency more succesful if he takes some risks .
The businessman can try new things , for example : He can hire people who know different things and create new departments or divisions in his company in order to obtain more clients and have major profits .

All in all , people who are decided to reach success , no matter the aspect they are concerned with ( school , work or family ) , they should apply personal experiences and try new things to obtain wished results in order to feel satisfied with the effort we have done .
