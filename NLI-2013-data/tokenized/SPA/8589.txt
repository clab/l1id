I am essentially agreed with this statement .
Understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .
But in my opinion they must learn facts too .
As far as I am concerned one thing implies the other .
If a student does not understand ideas or concepts , he will not be able to learn facts in a proper way .

We shall see this clearly with an example .
If a student has to learn for his history exam the main events of the French Revolution , he can just study the main facts ( such as king 's prison and death and Robespierre 's government ) but if he does only this , he will forget them easily , even before the exam .
What he should do is trying to understand the causes of the Revolution .
If he knows that French people was almost starving while the queen made costume-parties at palace , he may be able to understand why the furious inhabitants of Paris took `` La Bastille '' , France 's most important jail and , consequently , he will remember easily the fact itself : the assault of `` La Bastille '' .

It is true that in earlier times , when my parents studied for instance , the students were told to learn facts .
Professors paid almost no attention to ideas or concepts .
Nowadays , it is quite the contrary .
At school , and even now , at University , we , as students , are supposed to be aware of ideas and concepts , but not of facts .
They are misregarded , as unimportant information .

I think that a really good education ought to cover both concepts ( which are basic to understand the causes of facts ) and facts themselves .
If we do otherwise the only thing we achieve is a partial idea of what we learn .
In order to clarify it more , I will give another example connected with the French Revolution .
If we know that `` La Bastille '' was assaulted at 1789 , that fact signifies nothing , it is only a number .
If we know that French people was upset with the king and queen in the later years of the 18th century we do n't know that at this moment the assault of `` La Bastille '' took place .

We must be familiar with everything in order to get a deep , a complete knowledge of the matter .
