I agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Knowing about different topics is not something that is good only during one 's study life , it is good for as long as we as individuals exist .
There are situations in which general knowledge is very useful .

A way to explain this idea , is with doctors and journalists .
It is true that later on their professional life medics specialize in one area in specific , but before that , they go through many fields of medicine until they finally reach the desired one .
In my personal experience I 've known many doctors speciallized in different areas of practice and they have been capable of answering or responding accordingly in different situations .
The other groups of professionals mentioned earlier , show us that they never confine themselves into only one area .
It is true that along their career they have the tendency to follow one field , but it is a fact that have to know about other things too .
Some newspapers have specialized journalist but when they work on shifts , they have to be able to handle every kind of information that shows up , otherwise , there would be an awful lot lost of information .

Nowadays , during job interviews , many companies ask their applicants their opinion on different matters and subjects not related to the posting they are applying for .
They do this in order to ackonwledge how well prepared they are , and to measure the level of literacy the personel has .
This is a situation that supports the idea expressed at the beggining of this essay .
Just for the fact that everyday we meet and talk to different people , we see and know for sure that we all have a varied diversity of opinions , this is something that is for our own benefit , so for all these reasons and examples stated before , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
