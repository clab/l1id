Young people are just beginning to live , while the elderly population have many experiences , both good and bad who have shaped the person they have become .
Some might say that young people enjoy life more because they can do whatever they please , they have the world at their feet .
Every person will eventually , become old and all they wil have left is the memory of their early days .
Young people might be able to do things like running , swimming , jumping faster and with more energy than the elders but there will be one time when all this energy will run out and they will become old .
Nothing is forever and we cannot get too much of a good thing .
Life is short and we have to learn to to live it to its fullest always living every moment as if it were the last .
Both young and old people can enjoy life up to the highest level if they set their minds to it .
I have recently begun to read a book called , `` Tuesdays with Morrie '' by Mitch Albom and it has really changed my opinion of life .
Morrie is Mitch 's old college professor and he is dying of a rare disease .
You would probably expect to see Morrie in a bed , feeling sorry for himself and letting his soul fall into the shadows before it is time .
Many people that are sick with a disease that has no cure give up easily and they wish they were young and full of life again .
We all get a chance to be young .
It is up to us to take advantage of it .
Getting back to the book , Morrie was a really exceptional person because he refused to fall into the ordinary pattern of dying before it is time .
Instead he tried to live what was left of this life at its fullest which , in my opinion is a really remarkable thing to do because not everyone has such amazing strength of character .

How can someone know that young people enjoy life more than old people ?
It is not possible to know this .
Nowadays , the young generation cares more about things that might seem important , such as getting a job that pays really well .
We forget that the things that we might sometimes take for granted may be the most important things to us .
Everyone can enjoy life at every age as long as they just live it , one day at a time .
Older people might sometimes enjoy life more than young people because they might remember to eliminate the unimportant , materialistic aspects fo life and embrace the most important thing in every human beings life : love .
