Advertisements are designed to sell a product , and to that end they can go the extra mile that might just push a customer to buy it ...
this can sometimes mean that an advertising company will resort to sensationalist announcements that could fall into the category of miraculous in regards to what the product can do for the consumer , and sometimes it merely results in an extensive and colorful use of human languages .

In the case of those advertisers that would aim for exagerating the effects their product will have on their consumers , a great deal of colorful metaphors and even lies might used .
A diamond ring could miraculously make the consumer look younger and more successful than they really are while in reality it all depends on the consumer 's ability to `` dress for the occasion '' .
A dietary product might reduce your waistline to that of the skeletal model you see in a magazine or that of an actress in a movie , when in reality you would probably have to have a balanced diet and - more often than not - an exercise regimen .

Where using languages colorfully is concerned , we can often observe skilled writers with an ample vocabulary available to them as a mental arsenal developing pieces of literary art that charm the consumer .
This is by far the preferred method as its intention is not to propagandize or sensationalize ( as would be the case of the first case ) , but to use language in a lyrically enticing form that catches the roll of a tongue or that particular inflection that might season a simple phrase to the point of perfection in the ear of the beholder .

In the end both cases do in fact make a product usually seem much better than it is .
In rare cases will a product satisfy the consumer as much as a well written piece of literature covering the product .
It 's my belief that the aim should always be for the product to be exceeded by its actual value or effectiveness ...
however , it should never be at the expense of the veritable truths of the product .

After all , creating fiction regarding a product could lead the consumers to driving a lawsuit against the company responsible for its development as well as the advertisers ...
We live now in a world where the public demands quality ...
even though it seeks fantasies .
