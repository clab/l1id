I believe successful people like to take risks and are not afraid to engage new situations .
Success is being in control of one self in order to achieved certain goals .
If you believe you can do it , you have much higher chances to obtaining that .
Successful people are motivated to try new things , to be creative , and to follow objectives even if the situation changes .

Successfull people differ from ordinary people becasue they take risks .
For example : Most of all great business ideas are innovative .
What makes a business man successful is the way he or she manages to develop the business model .
Most probably , it will requiere to invest both time and money to an entrepeneur activity .
It will also requiere to learn new things , maybe processes and managerial skills .
To do so , it demands to learn new things and to take risks .

In the other hand , ordinary people are most likely to stay where they are , in what I call comfort zone .
They are not willing to take chances , and usually bypass great oportunities because they believe that it is too risky or too hard to achieve .

Basically , I differentiate people by their attitud .
Successful ones , have a positive attitud toward change and are self confident .
They believe thay can achieve it .
And even if they fail , their attitud rise them up again to keep on developing greater ideas .
Success is a continious activity , not a goal you reach and it is over .

They are many examples of success .
I like to state my own experience .
I have worked for 3 years achieving professional goals , and learning new activities .
I have been recognized for my committment , and now I work as General Manager for the company .
I have great attitud toward change and problem solution .
I have made my mistakes but always learned from them .
I believe everything is posible when you are clear about it .
Now a days , I am on my way to study a specialized master degree , ready to learn new things , to share my own ideas and listen to others .

I believe success is a way of living .
