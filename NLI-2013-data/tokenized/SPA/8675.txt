Debates on wherether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts versus simply learning the facts are very common .
Comprehending and understanding the concepts and ideas is obvioulsy more important than simply learning the facts .

there are many reasons why understanding ideas and concepts is more important that learning facts .
If a student is only memorizing facts they will not understand why the answere or the outcome was what it was .
The students attend school to gain knowlage not to memorize facts .
If they are merley learning the facts they are being robber of their education .
When the student leaves the class they should be able to answere why something happend the way it did not just know that it happened .

Furthermore , the tools the student recinves by understanting ideas and concepts are much more valuale than the ones he or she will learn by only memorizing facts .
By understanding concepts the student will be able to apply them to different stituations and come to other conclusions .
If a student understantds that something happens because of some reason they can answere more questions and know more about the subject that those who only know the facts .

Although in most occasion it is easier to learn the facts instead of understanding the concepts in the long run understanding the concepts is more valuable .
The student that understands the concept will be able to answere more questions on the subject and be over all more knowlegable on the topic .
The student that simply memorized the facts will eventually forget them and will have gaind nothing at all .
