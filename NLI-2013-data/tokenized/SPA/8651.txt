Education has always been an important issue since our begginigs .
Greek scolars created their own system of teaching .
Curiosity is what take us to the desire of learning .
Nowadays there are very sofisticated methods of learning .
Educational systems have been improved since scolastic Greek method began .
Some philosophers of the Illustration said that our students were the base of our society .
But is is not easy to make a student learn .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Understanding is the process in which people 's mind made a clear idea of something .
Understanding something takes us to a process of learning in which we can not also achieve knowledge , but manipulate things using that knowledge .

Learning facts is to learn the words of what a law says or dictate us something without being completely sure about it .
This method of learning is very risky because it does not allows students to analize deeply the topic , it just tell them what it is .

According to Tales of Mileto , the world is managed by cosmological laws .
And this laws can be predicted if the necessary knowledge is achieved .
For example the movement of the space corps .
By learning the fact of the movement of a specific corps we could know the fact that it moves .
Meanwhile understanding the idea can allow us to understand the orbit of the corp and we can be able to predict at what time it would appear visible to us .

The learning of facts has taken part of our history .
Aristotle told laws fundamentated on his observations on the fallen of corps in Earth .
For many years we could not make any progress because the method of learning facts .
There were facts considered true just because someone told it .
Different to this , by understanding ideas we can analize properly what we consider necessary and create our own posture about it .
Undestanding facts was what Galileo Galilei did experimentation on fallen of corps .
Thus he created his own theory .

Time never lies .
True always arise at a certain time such as the methods used by Aristotle and Galileo Galilei .
We could certainly observe which method is the correct one .
learning facts has many limits .
Therefore we can conclude that understanding ideas is the best procedure in order to real learning .
