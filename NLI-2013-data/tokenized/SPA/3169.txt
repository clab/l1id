The realm of ages bettween people have always fascinated me .
Thinking on how and when we enjoy life is interestign and difficult too .

I do not agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .
For as long as a remember , I used to enjoy life when I was fourteen the same way I do now .
I mean , the years pass by , and time goes on , but we still being enjoing it in different ways .
Must of this depens on how we see life and what are we expecting four it .

For example some weeks ago , I was talking with my grandfather about his early years in college .
He told about his affairs and adventures during that time , but later the talk came deep and he talked me about his present .
He told me about how his fighting against cancer , and how tha make him feel , how hard he is triying to keep waking up each day .
I was hearing him , not feeling comfotableand with the situation and intrigated with his future .
But suddenly , he reach my hand and told me how fascinated he was with bad times too .
He told me how bad situations can help us enjoy good ones , son every partor age is enjoylable .

Today , after that talk with the old man , I knew we all enjoy life the same way , even we are younguer or older .
All depends on how we aprroach to it and built it .

So , finally I just can say that im hoping to know tomorrow , how was that I enjoyed life in all different ways .
And keep specting the good things and the bad things to happen for me and the others , but taking them a the best way I could .
