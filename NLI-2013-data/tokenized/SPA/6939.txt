I disagree with this statement .

When you see the evolution of the number of cars in twenty years , is constantly growing .
That is why I do not think that that in twenty years after there will be fewer cars in use .

Car represents one of the most important product of consumption .
The majority of people in developed countries has a car because it is confortable , easy to go everywhere and mainly to go at work .
In countries like United States , cars are necessary because distances are very big .
Many families in United States have two cars and Americans generally learn very early to drive .

The main problem of car is that it consumes petroleum .
This energy is more and more difficult to find and it costs a lot of money .
Car represents too one of the major causes of pollution and which provoques environement 's degradations .

So with all this factors can we considers that in the fututre there will be less cars in use than today ?

I do not thin so .
Car 's ingeneers invent prototypes of cars which will be differents than today 's cars .
And I think that in the future there will be cars with another type of energy like hydrogen .
So as car'constructors find solutions to make non pollution cars
