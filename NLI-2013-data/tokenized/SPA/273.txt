I am disagree with this statement .
If you learn with statements it will be more simple to learn and archieve in the mind .
You can learn for what you need that for , see what is the important to learn , situations , will not be only ideas , concepts and theory .
It will be more fun for students .

When a math teacher give the class the students dont know for what they have to learn that thay always say is `` for what i need to learn that i dont going to be a CPA '' .
But if they teach the kids the facts for what the need to learn that , the importance to need that to be someone in the world .
They only learn the concepts take the exams get an A and then what .
They go out to difficult world without knowing for what they are going to use the concepts .

That is one of the big problems of the US nation , what I 'm going to study now ? .
Millions of students graduate every year without knowing what they are going to study .
Brilliant students working in foodcourts , why ?
because they know to much they graduate with 4.00 points but they dont know where to go know .

That orientation does n't exist , thats why I think that the best way to a student can learn is by facts , so he can know before he goes out from school in what he is good for .
