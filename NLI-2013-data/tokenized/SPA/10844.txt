In my opinion you can be successful in a variety of ways , and as a result of different efforts .
For instance you have the people that take many risks and innovate in the economy ; I think they are needed in the society and in the evolution of things , but they are not the only ones needed .
In the other hand we have people that know how to do things and that stick to what they have learned in the process in order to be confident and efficient .

Successful people that take risks are generally agressive in their way of reacting to changes in the market and sometimes they will innovate without reason .
They wo n't stay in peace when things have changed , and furthermore they will make changes to the way of making business and to their sorroundings .
This kind of person does n't rests and is always thinking of ways to improve the odds of making a good deal , as an effect they will push others in the field to innovate too in order to survive .

There is no recipe for success , so to think that taking risks will help you assure that you will have success is totally wrong .
When sometimes taking risks could help , sometimes it could make more damage than estimated .
Certain kinds of persons have other characteristics that are important in the economy , those persons are the ones that stick to what they know and that are efficient in that way .
This way of being gives them security and helps them to be efficient workers , confident of the way they react to the market and its changes .

As a conclusion , there is market for everyone , and the different kinds of being are needed in the way
