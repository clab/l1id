The understanding of ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for education of youth people .
I am strongly agreed with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea .

In the first place , the importance of understanding our history and facts does not only depends on our knowledge of the facts , but also the comprehension of why all of the things are and was happening in our world .
The World War II was the most cruelty war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts .
Beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas of how to rule the world .
Furthermore , I can see the reasons of bringing a country to the war as the United States did to that war .
The US could see people have thier natural rights which are inherited to human being such as freedom or religion .
These are ideas .

Second , we use ideas and concepts not only to find out facts , but also to learn about our future problems and facts .
Math is a science that you have to understand theories and concepts to solve the problem .

Third and finally , I think ideas and concepts create a critical inspiration to the society , which makes us better observers of the world .
In this case , we should to recognise the roots of poverty to improve this world and the ideas and concepts can bring these solutions .

In conclusion , I think the more ideas and concepts we understand , the better comprehension of world we have .
It is more important to know the why than to know because and the same fact , because history can repeat the same idea
