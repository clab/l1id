From my point of view it 's better to have a good knowledge of the academic subjects in some specific profession and , inside this profession , is good to specialize in one particular subject .
So , as usual in live , the radical position are not always the right way to choose .

To explain my point let me define a basic framework .
You have a set of professions , fo example , economics , law , art , etc. and inside one profession set you have some specialize fields , for example , inside economics you have Microeconomics and Macroeconomics .
Finally , inside a specialization field you have specific subjects , for example , inside the Microeconomic field you have , consumer 's behavior or firm 's behavior .

In that sense , you have to choose a profession according your personnal skills .
Once you choose your profession you have to know , al least in general , all the aspects inside it .
Because the specific subject you choose always deals with others general topics .
For example , if you choose Economics and specifically microeconomics , you have to know some statistical techniques .
Finally , of course , you choose a specific subject .

There 's an advantage in choosing and specific subject because you can profundize some subject and studied it better .
Eventually you can do some interesting contributing to the theory and became a reference research .

However , my points deals with the perception of live .
If your only objetice in live is to get some money to pay the bills , maybe it 's a good path `` know some of all '' , so you will never get unnployeed .
But I think , even with this point of view , you can have more opporunities if you specialized in one subject , due a few persons could do your work .
