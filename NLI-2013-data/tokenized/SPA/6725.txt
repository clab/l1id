Since the first car was created , the number of cars have increased every year .
From my point of view that will be the same in the next years .
I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .

Basically i belive the social demand will going on increasing .
City are overcrowed and we tend to emigrate from the cityies to areas closed to the city but more calm and sometimes with less pollution that the city one .
If we live some kilometres far to the city we will need a transport to go there .
There is public transport , but usually it is expensive and less confortable than a car .
Human love to be confortable even if that damage for instance the environement .
Because of that , because we love confortability , we will usually choose our own car in stead of the public transport to move ourselfs .

Secondly , I belive in several years a less-polluted car will be created .
People are more concern with the environement than years ago .
We think more in the environement , damage , pollution causes , consecuences .
In fact , scientifcs are reaserching a way to built car that emited less gases to the atmosphere , as electrical car .
If they achive their aim , we will have `` healthy '' car and we will not have moral conflicts in uses them whenever we wanted .
I mean , that maybe now , there are peolple worried about the pollution and because of that he , she doenot take car as much she woukd like .

IN conclusion , because of the arguments aboved mentioned , ( there are other but the time is out ) in my opinion we could see much car running the roads that the number of them tha we can see now .
