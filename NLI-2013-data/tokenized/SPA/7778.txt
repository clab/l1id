In my personal experience , I have traveled both in a group led by a tour guide , and in a group with out a tour guide .
I think that one of this experince is better and fun .
Next I will comparate this two situations .

If you travel whit a tour guide , then you do n't need to search maps , itineraires and local information , because the tour guide will have all the things that you migth need on a trip , this is a possitive sigth of traveling with a guide .
But also travel with a guide means that you are not owner on you schedule , because you need to follow the itinerary of travel agency .
For example , when I went to Brasil with my class , I had to do all the things that the tour guide tell us to do , so we ca n't decide wich restorant pick for lunch , or with Pub to go on nigths .

On the other side of the coin , if you travel by yourself , with out a tour guide , then you can do all the things that you want to do , for example , if you wish to sleep all the afternoon on the beach on Rio de Janeiro , you can do it ; or if you want to spend one entierely day on just one place , you can do it too .
But such as the first position ( travel WITH a guide tour ) , travel with out a guide implies some problems , for example : where can I change money ? , where can I register in ? , How much should I pay for a suvenir ? .

In my personal opinnion , I think that travel in grup with out a guide is the best way to travel .
This mean that you can program your own trip , and you dont need to follow an schedule .
When I have traveled with out the led of a tour guide , I 've had more funn .
