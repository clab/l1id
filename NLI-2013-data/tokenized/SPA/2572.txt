I agree that young people enjoy life more thatn older people do , because young people are experimenting every day new things that most of the older people have lived before or already know .
For example , a young boy enjoy every single moment when is riding a bycicle , no matter if this new experiment implies pain or time to get it done well , while an old man could not find it enjoyable trying to do for the first time or once again , because this person knows at some point that any mistake could cause him/her seriuos pain or physical problems that the young boy is not aware of .

Also young people have the believe that they are going to die when they get old .
They are not aware of the danger or consecuences of their acts or behaviour .
For instance , one old man is aware that speeding his/her car on a main highway could be deadly and not only could make some damages to the car but to him/herself and other people around as well .
In this case , the young boy do not measure the responsability that it takes to drive a car to one place to another on a main highway using and respecting the transit signals .
So the first thing that cross the young boy 's mind is to speed on the car , but at that moment the young boy is enjoying every second .
One personal experience related to this example was when a good and very close friend of mine had an motorcycle accident during christmas eve , in which he almost passed away , leaving him serious traumas on the head and the back .

For this reasons and examples mentioned above which are cruel and hard I believe that most of the time young people enjoy life than older people do .
Although , sometimes there are cases in which
