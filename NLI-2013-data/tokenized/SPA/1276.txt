it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject area because it it gives a broader view on life and the different aspects of it > having knowledge in many different areas allows an individual to understand how people think and why they think as they do > this is very important in life because it helps people get through life safely and soundly without much conflict > when an indicidual has achieved knowledge in several sectors of the academic spectrum he or she can view life and everything in life from many different angles and perspectives > having a broader knowledge can help you empathize with different people in different times and in different places > having a good knowledge of history for instance helps a person understand why certain events in history took place and why people thought the way they did duing those times > having a broad knowledge in math helps a person understand how the world is connected and how the flow of ideas works > understanding math allows a person to undertand the true value of things and the meaning of many questions and values > a great knowledge of philosophy allows a person to govern him or herself and learn vituosity and morality > now when all these areas are combined together < a person can view life from a numerical sense < a historical sence < and a metaphysical sense > this allows for better interpretations of events < problems and so forth in that could come up in life > if a person is only educated in one subject area < he or she will be confined and contricted to one way of thought and one way of understanding or analyzing situations and problems > when only one academic area is studied the learner will become a prisone of that area and will therefore be a close minded person > the world todqy is filled with close minded people < these are the people who are causing corruption and a potential threat to the word as a whole > this is why citizens of the world should fight illiteracy and work on manking evey mind an open mind in order to make this world a better place for everyone >
