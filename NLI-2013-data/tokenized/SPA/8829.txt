To me both aspects are important because a student should have the knowlege and the understanding of the idea and the concepts of an specific topic before they learn a fact on it .

That is because I actually think that , when you have a fact on any matter , that fact happens as a response to several or various events that happend before therefore an student should know all the concepts and ideas , or all the information he can have on a certain matter to become aware or to have a logical explanation of why that fact or event turned that way .

In my specific field of medicine , that is obstetrics and ginecology , an student needs to know all the information about labor and delivery , for example , refering to all the changes the uterus , the delivery channel and the vagina go thru , and all of the bio-mechanical aspects of the uterus contractions , the biochemicals aspect of the contraction , all the active and passive changes that the mother an the fetus have in the labor and delivery event , as well as all the changes that occur in the pregnancy , before getting to learn how to take care or handle a delivery event .
That way if something goes wrong he will have all the information on wath is going wrong an if there is a way to make it go the way it is supposed to go , and have the knowledge to handle any undesired event .

Tha same reason apllies to a student that can learn how to do a c-section , or learn the tehcnics aspects of how to perfomr it , but if he does not have all the anatomical information about the human body , anything can go wrong in that procedure and it will turn to the death of the mother and the baby .

So I think that every fact has an explanation and the more you learn about the conceps or ideas leading to a certain fact the more you will know about the fact itself .
