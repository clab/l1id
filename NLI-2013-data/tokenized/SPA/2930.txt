As older people always say : Times are different now and the past was always better .

When you are a child , you are not afraid because everything is new in this world and your parents are there to support you .
Then , you grow up , you become a teenager and you think life is to LIVE IT AND ENJOY IT , then you are an adult and your responsabilities increase , you have to forget about yourself and think about people around you , and when you are an old person you wish you had more time to do what you never did and always wanted to do , you wish you could have made more mistakes to learn from them but ...
time is gone .

Young people enjoy their lives going to the club , dancing , drinking : this is what they call `` having fun '' .
Older people go to the winery , listen to the music that brings old memories , they enjoy themselves on their own way .
I think both generations younger and older people live their lives the best way they can , they enjoy doing the activities they like and they consider are fun according to their beliefs and their philosophy in life .

The difference lies on the risks they take .
When you are young you feel no fear , you think there is only one life and you have to live it the fullest , you own your world .
But , When you are older , you also know that only one life was given to you , but your pholosophy , your perspective is different because you think since there is only one life to live , you have to appreciate it , take care of it and enjoy it loving and respecting yourself : risks are not the same in each stage of life .

When you are young a risk can be skipping school and that would be very exciting , when you are older skipping class is not fun , it is being irresponsible .

I do not think there is a list of activities to define whether or not someone enjoys life , I think it depends on each one and the way you were raised .
The gift of life was given to us and we can enjoy it the way we want as long as we do not affect other people 's beliefs and lives .
