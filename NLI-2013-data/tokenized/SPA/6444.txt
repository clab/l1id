If we are taking about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least as many cars as today .

It is a possibility that in modern countries , we will use the car less and less with the pass of the years .
We live in growing cities , every day a higher pertentage of the population lives in cities .
And every one that live in a big city can tell you the unusefull and expensive bussines is to have a car .
Is much more eficent to take the public transportation system or even a motorbike , or even a bike .
Any of this solutions is cheaper and faster than moving thoughout the city by car .

In addition we have the problem of the petroleum .
We are aproaching to the famous peak oil .
Some day in the close future we could not attend all the energetic demand of the world just with oil .
So oil and fuel will enhance his prizes , and having a car will be more and more expensive every day .
So not every one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it as today .

But in the other hand there are a lot of high populated contries , developing countries .
Is reasonable to suppose that many people of these contries will be rich enough to pay for a car and its manteinance .
Also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbols of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary .

So although in Europe and the USA , we will probably have less cars , in China , India or Brasil the number or cars will certently increase a lot in the next few decades .
So this is the reason I do not agree the statement above .
