Today 's youth is a busy and stressed one .
Too busy to interact with their communities and their surroundings .
Young people have responsibility such as school and afterschool activities as well as the desire to have a social life .
It is because of these elements that I agree that young people nowadays to not give enough time to helping their communities .

As a highschool 12th grader , I must admitt that the mayority of people my age to not have time to help their communities .
School is a hectic responsability and homework is increased throughout the year .
When I have time off , I need to work on future homework assignments or on organizing my time for the other responsabilities that I have prioritized as more important than my community .

Another element in young peoples lives that takes away from helping the community , is afterschool activities .
As an avarage highschool student , I take swimming classes afterschool or help the student council set up school events .
If i am not working for the school or for my physical being , than i am in town practising for my SATs .
I spend most of my weekdays worrying about my grades and my reponsabilities as a grade representative , than wondering what i could do to help the community .

Once school and afterschool events are over , I use my weekends to relax and go out with my friends .
Young people nowadays do n't really care about the community and rather worry about their own problems .
If you ask young people what they find most important you will realize that their answer is selfish , in that it only thinks about themselves , because they only have time to worry about themselves .

In conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities out but , it is only because we lack the time to do something about it .
If our lives were more organized and less occuppied , perhaps an interest in helping our communities would surface .
