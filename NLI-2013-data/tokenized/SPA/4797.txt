I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons .

First of all , the marketing has been always worked behind the objective of : `` sell ...
as much as you can the product '' , ...
and how do they know how to sell us something ?
how do they know how to make us buy what they want us to buy ?
Well , first of all , they study the consumers .

In my opinion , it 's more than obvious that everybody wants the best price based on quality everytime they are going to buy a product .
This is not something easy , because if a business create something with high quality and sell that product cheap , they would never get a good profit of it .
So , is you create a product , at a price , and you want to sell as much as possible , how are you going to do it ?
Well , there is where the marketing , and therefore , the advertisements , enter in our discussion .
It 's seems something easy , but it 's not .
The first thing they have to do is study the consumer , what they need , at what price , when and how much .
If the product that they are trying to sell , has everything the consumer wants , perfect , they did it !
but that is very very difficult , because no all the consumers are the same , it affects the age , the sex , where are they from , what they like ...
so , the solution is make the product and make it look like the consumer wants it to be .
It can sound strange , but I think that the objective of the advertisement is try to sell you something they want you to buy , sometimes a product that you really need for your life , but sometimes they create you wehat I called , artificial need .

Lets just try to think about us , I 'm sure there has been at least one time in the life of everybody that had bought something that it seemed great on television and then it is n't as good as we thought .

My experience was buying a car , it looked amazing on television and it has a great price too , but something cheaps costs you expensive ...
everybody was buying this car , so I decided to buy it and , at least , it was n't as amazing as I thought at first .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because the objective of the advertisement is to sell you something and make you buy it , even if its as good as it seems , or not .
