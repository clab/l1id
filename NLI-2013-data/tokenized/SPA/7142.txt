Why is it a problem ? .
There will be fewer cars in use in twenty years and i Think that it would be a great advantage .

This fact woul be fantastic for the world environment .
The lack of cars implies that the pollution decreases .
And it will suppose the appearing of new vehicles and people will have to get the public transports or another way of moving .
Riding would be a good sustitute in order to this situation .

The problem is that new transport will appear too and not all people will be able to buy it because of its price .
Only the people who have money will get the ` future transport ' or may be that the really ` future transport ' will be the bycicle ...
Nobody know this yet .

On the one hand , we have all these points but on the other hand it implies that many people who work in facts making cars or people who sell them , people that deal with cars will have problems .
May be they lose their job or something like that and it would be a really great problem .
If in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today people will walk more and make more sport which helps their body to be fine .
As advantage we wo n't see so many traffic problems in the future , I hope , and the accidents will decrease too .

In conclusion , i think that it will suppose a lot of changes in our lifes .
