I agree with this statement based on my experience of traveling .
First of all if you contract a guide you can be sure that you are hiring an expert in what you are a complete ignorant and therefore he will do it , for sure , twice as good as you .

To begin with a very good reason of choosing a guide we can say that it will be cheaper because he knows the place and cost of the attractions and in case you want to see a show that is held in two different establishments at the same time he could recommend you the cheaper , furthermore the decrease in other expenses like lodging , food , etc. will surely yield that the money you are wasting in your tourist guide will be less than the money you are saving .

Other important reason is that you wo n't get lost , for example , once when I visited Barcelona I did n't want to get a guide because we only had a few hours to stay in the town , my surprise was when we almost lost half of the time looking for a monument instead of taking advantage of the amazing harbor or other events there .

The last advantage of having this person in a tourist group is that he knows the city and he will warn you of certain dangerous zones of the city or disabled roads , a personal reference of this reason has happen to me a year ago when my family and I went for vacations in Seattle , we were walking in downtown without a guide and admiring the amazing skyscrapers of the city when suddenly we realized that it was getting dark , and of course we did n't know that that zone inthe night is a little creepy ( of course , no map warns you about that ) and when we decided to go back to the car we were in the middle of hundreds of welfare people begging for money , fortunately no disasters happened to us but it was a lesson that I will never forget .

My conclusion would be that a guide is best investment you can make in a tour
