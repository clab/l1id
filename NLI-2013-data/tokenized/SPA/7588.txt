I agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide if the destination is one that 's new to you .

If one is visiting a country for the first time , and especially if one doesnt know how to speak the native language , and is completely unfamiliar with the visiting location , it is best to go with a tour guide .
Tour guides are very qualified and have a lot of knowledge about the country 's history , customs , food , traditions , culture and must-see monuments .
They also provide useful help regarding hotels and good eating and entertainment locations .
This is very beneficial because not only one sees and experiments a new country , but also one gets to know about it , to grow as a person and as a citizen , expanding one 's horizons getting to see more than meets the eye , experiencing the history of the place , the way people behave and live in that specific place , one gets to feel embraced by the country and its culture in a way that engages you to it , in a way you 'll never forget and hardly will experience again .

The first time I visited Italy and learned about its artists , its culture , music and history i fell in love with it , the first time I got to interact with its people I was certain I would come back one day and live the rest of my life there , in Italy , in Rome ...
I learned that there 's more to Italy than a Colliseum , there 's more than the language and there 's more than the famous ` gondolas ' to it , it 's what 's behind all those creations , the thoughts , the magic , the inspiration and the passionate drive what makes that country so beautiful , passionate and perfect in my eyes .
That 's why I belive it is better to travel with a tour guide , it takes you farther , you get to travel not only with your body , but with your heart and mind .

However , if the destination is a place one 's already familiar with , and specially if one 's traveling with a partner , or in a honeymoon , it would be much more comfortable to go as a couple , without any tour guides , rediscovering the country by one 's own means and visiting the places one wants to visit , not necessarily the most visited and popular places , but for instance , one 's favorite restaurant , one that probably not much people know about , but that it 's excellent and brings back beautiful memories .
Also if one 's traveling with the whole family , especially with small kids , it would be very difficult to pay attention to the tour guide without being interrupted by a tantrum and fights between brothers and sisters , so it would not be the best idea to go with a tour guide .

For instance , I am from Venezuela even though I 'm living in the US , and I think I know pretty much everything about my country , so visiting my country with a tour guide wouldnt make much sense to me , since I already know it and the places I like to visit and that are so special to me , and it would only take time from me visiting my best friends and my family , all of whom live there , and since my point of visiting would be to see my friends and family again , having a tour guide would only be an obstacle in the way of enyoying my trip , therefore it wouldnt be beneficial for me in any sense .

To conclude , I think its a great idea to visit a country with a tour guide if that place is new to you and you would like to know and learn about it , nurturing your mind .
However if its a place that 's already familiar to you , it would be much more enyoyable to go with a partner and enjoy the country as you know it .
