I disagree with the statement because I do n't think that enjoying life has anything to do with age .

I believe there are more issues that have to be take into consideration in order to establish whether a person at any particular age does or does not enjoy life .
Health , for instance , is crucial for happiness and therefore can be determinant for enjoying or not enjoying life .
One 's character and emotional stability are also important factors .
I 'm sure there are old people that suffer from bad health and are not able to enjoy life fully , but this could also be the case of a teenager suffering from Leuchemia and feeling miserable .
He is young but not necessarily enjoys life .
On the other hand , there must be people that being old , have the blessing of having the best health and therefore enjoy life more than troubled teenagers struggling with their banalities .

Other factors can infuence the conception of self-hapiness of a person like family , social or cultural class , opportunities , income level , etc .
All these factors impact people of all ages .

I also think that it is a matter of attitude .
While there are outer factors that influence the way we enjoy life or feel happy , it is what everyone makes out of the siuations what at the end of the day determines their conception of happiness .
The way we deal with problems and our ability to solve them , the very thought of ourselves as free living beings and the attitude we have towards our enviroment , are factors that will make the people that sorround us decide whether we are enjoying life or not .

The statement is misleading beacise it inferrs that young people can do more things than old people and can therefore enjoy life more .
