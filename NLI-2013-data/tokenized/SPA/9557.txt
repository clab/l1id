There are different ways to develop an activity or to approach to a problem .
Some people prefer to try new things and take risks .
On the contrary , a more conservative group of people prefer only doing what they already know how to do well .
But there may be succesful cases in both gropus .
Then , what is the best attitude ?

When people stick to their own traditional methods they are able to solve basic , elemental problems , but do not have the psychological or intelectual resources to imagine a new possibility , a challenging solution or a new discovery .
They fear failing , and feel more secure doing exactly what they have always done for a long time .
These people do not innovate but maintain traditions and keep everything in its place and relatively under control .

On the other hand when we try new things and ideas we touch different dimensions of the problem .
We are not prejudiced by common opinions and statements and sometimes we can see or foresee completely different aspects of the situation .
People who belong to this group are eager to take risks and do not fear failure , danger or doing special efforts in order to reach their goals .
In this case , people have to be energetic , very enthusiastic about their ideas and good team leaders .

Personally , I think that in order to succed you should try something new each time .
It is very rewarding when you discover something that maybe was so close that nobody could see .
Even though you may find that many people turn against you because they think your ideas are ridiculous or stupid , you have to insist and keep on working because at last , things will go well and something very good will happen .

So , next time you have to solve a problem , I recommend trying something completely new for a change .
