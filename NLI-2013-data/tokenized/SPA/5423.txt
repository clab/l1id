The world we are living in is a globalized and competitive one , as economies have come closer to each other , producers and consumers are growingly becoming part of one single global market .

Goods and services can now be offered through out the world with very little barriers and similar technologies available to almost every producer .
Therefore , products are becoming increasingly difficult to be differentiated .

In order to differentiate , produces look for the objetive and subjective qualities that can make the product unique or distinctive , and then they must communicate these qualities to its potential consumers , mainly through advertisement .
So every day we face endless promises of how good and special a product can be , some times appealing to the objective qualities or the subjective qualities , or perhaps a combination of both .

I consider this is to be fair right that producers have in order to succeed in this competitive market .
The statement that false promises are made by produces is rather unfair , since mostly it refers to the subjective qualities of the product .
In the end , it will always be the customers choice to purchase the product based on his or her personal preferences .

Lets consider the example of a car advertisement where they first explain the specifications of the engine and technical features .
This is are mostly objetive qualities , and the producer has the responsibility of being truthful , actually , false claims are not only illegal but also harmful to the manufacurer long term success .
On the other hand , when they explain the subjective elements that will make you buy the car , they are appealing to your personal taste , which will be the judge of how good or not the car is , leaving no room for seeming to be what it is not .

In conclusion , I must disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are , since it is founded on the premise that the advertiser could be liable for differences in judgements on subjetive matters .
