Advertisements sometimes are just an information that not show the true , it is just a way to show and offer the product .

All the products have to have an advertisement , but sometimes this kind of ads only show the common rules that all the products must have .

In my opinion advertisments must show the true composition of the product , no matter if it significate a major cost for the company who produce this kind of products .
Advertisments are very important because they show us if that product is correct or no for our consume .

I agree with most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , some Products show qualities that are n't true when you consume it , the only thing that they concern its sell their products no matter if it is so good or no .

They try to hide some details , and that details can be harmful for some people .
A lot of peolple ca n't consume some ingredients , for example a diabetic person should n't taste sugar , but if an advertisment do n't show the quantity of sugar that the product have , this product is harmful for that person , even can cause an intoxication .

I think we must create a rule for advertisments , all of the products should have a complety list of ingredients and the quantity and quality of these , the products must be clasificated .

To conclude I can say that advertisment sometimes can be entertaiment but sometimes can be cheerfully , all we have to do is look and try to find the real purpose of the product .
