` Who hit first hit twice ' is a common phrase used in my country and this phrase described to a person who take risks in order to get success in any area .

Nowaday , the opportunities are for the people who likes to risk in order to get a good bussines position , or even be well with he/sheself .

I am a person who like risks , that is the main reason why I am here , taking this exam , in a country that is not mine , living far of home .
Before I came here , many friends of mine told me that study in the U.S. is not a good idea because they think that it is better idea be in a familiar place , speaking a familiar languaje , getting good grades due to they can understand everything that the people say .
But the true is that it is not .

I really wanted to come here , learn another language , another cultures , and learn about academics skills and also life skills .
It is not easy , I had have a lot of troubles to get the ideas in class or to understood what the people out of campus is telling me .
But nothing or nobody is going to stop me .
No matter how many times I have to take this exam , or how many times needs the Professor or the lady in the store to explain me something .
Someday I will get the idea and I will success .

I strongly believe that the people has a brain to use it developing new ideas or taking new risks .
Instead of that , some people is like robots , just following rules in a rutine life .
This people has fear of choose a way , a own way .

I like people who take risks in order to get succss , I like the people ` who hit first ' because I am one of them .
