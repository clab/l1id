Youth is one of the more common subjet in litterature or in social behaviour .
Now a days we are living a real obsession with youth , being youth , looking youth , keeping youth ...
and a reject with all that can suggest us that we are getting old each minutes we go throught .
I agree with the satement that suggest that Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I consider youth as the ideal state of human being .

Young people enjoy life because each day they are learning something new , beacuse their bodies are fresh and elastics , because they dont hace a headache if they drink two beers one night at the pub .
They have a very good health and the consciense of ethernity , they are sure they will never die .
Energy , curiosity and inocence makes a young person a being that can enjoy life a lot , beacuse future belongs to them

In the other hand , old people are often ill , not only in their bodies but also in their souls and minds , they have lived throught calamities , heart breaks , forgot , unforgivenness , death of other beloved partners , and thats why they have lost ( the bigger part of them , there is still many old people with hope and inocence ) all the features that can make a human being enjoy life .
They do n't want to move for discover new things , they have lost curiosity .
They lives in the past , remembering things that are not here today and they forget themselves , quitting the possibility of a happy present .

Romans and greeks wrote a lot about the sadness of leaving the youth island , with its pleasures and its swetness , for entering in the mature dessert where everything we do takes us lots of pain and effort .
Carpe diem , enjoy the instant , was their lema , their solution , the only way of being able to have a happy ancianity is to have lived a happy youth , because you never know whats going to happen with you tomorrow .
Thus , you wont leave heavy stones of frustration or hate for you in the last years of your life .
Be light in your early years and so u will in the later ones .
