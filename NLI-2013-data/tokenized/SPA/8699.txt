Throughtout my life I have always try to do the most to have great marks on all the courses I have ever took and all my experiences have showed me how important is to understant ideas and concepts while I am studing .
That is why I agree with the statement .

Obviously , in an exam you are required to have some specific knowlegde about the topic , but to have good scores and to really understand the material it is more important to know how to connect the concepts and the ideas .
The most important is to understand the main point , the main idea .

Since I began my Political Science university life I realised that it was not enough to memorize all the political conceps the teachers explained to me .
It was not enough to memorize all the international regims or all the international agreements the countries had signed .
I was required to say what the countries gain or lose in signing them and this agrrements affect them .

Furthermore , normaly those things that you are just memorized after you forget it so memorize concepts is just a lose of time .
Once upon a time , nearly four or five years ago a took an exam on the history course .
The exam was about the Second War .
I always have been problems with the Second War , the borders changes appears me so confusing so I was the whole week studing for this exams .
In consequence I took great marks on that course .
But two years after , I took a International European Relations course and in the final exam I was required to explain the Second war .
What happened then ?
I felt the exam because I had no dea about that conclict .
That happened because four years ago I just had memorized the concepts and the facts without understanding them .

In conclusion , through my experiences i have realised that it is more important for students and specially for me to understand ideas and concepts .
