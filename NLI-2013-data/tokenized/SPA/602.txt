The more you know , the more valuable you are to your community .
I agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
The world we live in demands us to be better prepared , open-minded , and adapted to our surroundings ; technology allows us to reach specific important information when needed .

Taking as a reference the business world , every year we see how globalization grows in the countries and how barriers disappear , creating the necessity of better prepared persons that understand the interactions between several fields of study , as well as the problems that are derived from these interactions .
These persons can identify and analyze problems or issues that arise and that need complex solutions .
Eventough they are not experts in one specific subject , they can diagnose a situation and offer different solutions according to what they know from many subjects .
In contrast , an individual specialized in only one subject might not be able to give value to the chain , and might just be looking for a mathematical solution , in the case he/she was a mathematitian .

Improvements in technology allow people to research and learn the important points of an specific field in the case more detail or comprehension is needed for an specific situation .
Good quality information is available to everyone in just a few click in the internet .

In an organization , a balance between the persons that have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and persons experts in one field has to be considered .
Although experts in a field might not be capable to make a complex analysis and may lack a global vision of the situation , they might be useful to help solve an issue in the event that the solution is of his/her domain .

Having a broad knowledge of many topics enables you to give more value to your community or your business , by having a more open view of the daily situations that arise and by knowing where to find a solution or who is the right person who could fix a problem .
