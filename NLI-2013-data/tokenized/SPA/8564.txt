I hereby agree than in the learning procces , you have to combine the experiences which are facts , with the knowledge which means ideas and concepts .
Since you are a kid , you start to learn facts , to ilustrate this , a crowling baby is going to know than crowl is usefull to touch things , to get what he desires , to experiment sensations or feelings , though the baby does not have enough develop of his body and mind to undestant the concept .
I meant learning fact is almost per se for your condition like human being , on the other hand , whereas ideas an concepts are the second step in the learning process .

According with the imformation above the students have to have the knowledges ( ideas - Concepts ) from books , from searches , from teachers , to know how to apply in the experience , nevertheless studies about education showed how the experimental learning is more effective than knowledges that you have in your mind but you dont know how to use them .

Despite the importance of theories , The experience that you life , you never are gonna forget it because is a bunch of feelings , thoughts , conclusions .
this argument support the idea about why the curricula have to be experimental , this way the student became his own teacher and the knowledge that he will get from books suppor his own experience .

To summarize , I belive the education is one of the most important value and award that you can obtein in your whole life , is why , if you are as lucky or fortunate to do it , filling your mind of ideas and concepts that day by day you are gonna life as facts .
