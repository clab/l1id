yes i do .
in my opinion i thing that the best way to travel is alone , not in goup , i 'll tell why .

first if you era in a travel group you heve tod follow the guide and the rest of the group , that indicate so you do n't have the time to enjoy the things that like you , the pictures are faster , quickly and other things that happen usually .

a travel group led by a guide tour could be not exited , becouse all the information is short and in mant cases are incorrec .
you supossed taht the guide knows everything , buy in some cases or some places do n't have the education or not are prepared .

i am not saying that all is bad , it have ome point on its side , you can ask , and always you will find a perfect anwer .

if i travel alone i can enjoy every thing that interes me. personally i am an architec , i like watch carfully the enviroment , like buildings , plazas , streets , houses and nature , and for those reasons i thing i cant enjoy a group tour .

on the other hand is more interesting if you construc your kwonlegemet because it will for ever , you can get imidiatly reference of places or buildings , and one important part i cant take pictures like i want .

i prefer take my time and not make any plan of the things that i going to .
thats not the sense of a travel. a travel is to get relax , drink some coffe in a little coffe shop , walk through the cities , visit some historical places , visit museums and why not meet people .

finally i wish i cant tavel by arond the word aolne and have many pictures and many histories to teel you when i came back .
