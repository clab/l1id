I do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Life enjoying has nothing to do with age .
It does not depend on the activities a person does , but on the feelings he has .

It is true that young people have more chances to experience different activities and to meet different people .
They are usually more open to learn from other people and to perform new activities .
Young people can meet new people at school , at work or at the clubs and bars .
They are also physically able to do sports , to travel to ` unsafe ' places , and to go to long-lasting parties .
This kind of activities can be good sources of joy and happiness .

But older people do not have to experience different activities or to meet different people to enjoy life .
As well as they get older , they identify what kind of activities provide them the most joy .
They also learn who are their true friends .
Older people stop worrying about everyday problems and start understanding the things that matter .
They have more time to spend with the family : they can enjoy their children and greatchildren more than they did while young .
They have more time to travel ( to ` safe ' places ) and to see their true friends .

I believe that the secret for life enjoying is to understand every age and not to try to take back time .
People who understand every moment as a unique opportunity to be happy can enjoy life when they are old as well as they did when they were younger .
And it is not a theoretical belief : I know old people who have enjoyed life only by understanding every moment .
My grandfather is a good example : he is 80 years old .
Everytime I see him he is smiling , everytime he remembers the past he smiles , and everytime he thinks about the future he smiles .
I want to live my life that way : I want to take the best of time with friends , with my family , at work and at the University in order to enjoy every second .
