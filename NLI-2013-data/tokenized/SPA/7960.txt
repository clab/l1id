the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is very very fun .
first you just start from the bigginig before you tarvel , going shoping with a big group of friends .
you buy a bunch of stuff for your trip , and at the same time your just having fun with your friends .
in just buying stuff , then while your at the airplane you talk , take pictures from the plane with your friends too !
then when you get to the place , lets say paris , you wanted to go there because you and your friends decides to go and because your going to have a lot of fun .
then when you are there you start with you tour guide that is very borring , obviously you have to learn a little about the country your visiting ok , ill handle that but not every day , and then go visit all kinds of museums .
after all that crowded day at night we go ut with my friends in group , that the big deal here going to have fun with all your friends togeather , because your with people that know waht you like or do not like , and because its a very special trip for you in a big happy group .
about a tour guide wasnt that fun because he like your boss well not like your boss seriously he just tells you what we have to do all day and what we need to visit .
i could do that all that stuff but in a calm day with my friends .
but i can handle all what the tour guides tells us to do while im with all my friends having fun , and its just because im with my friends , to see how fun it is to be with a very big group you know well and can have a great time .
