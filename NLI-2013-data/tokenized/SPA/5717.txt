In a competitive bussines world , marketing departments have developed powerful strategies to obtain customers 's attention .
Companies based on the needs to maximize profits , make advertisements that capture the buyer 's attention , producing an effect in people , that they need to buy something that they do n't really need .

Everything that people buy , comes by the looks .
Sometimes it 's necessary to make look good an item more than usual , in order to make it attractive to the viewers .
I 'm the kind of person who thinks that people needs to show their best in order to sell themselves .
Of course is not fair for the customers if companies say they will resolve their health problems if they buy the ( xx ) capusles , and later on buyers realize is just another pill .
From this point of view companies need to measure their words , because there is thousands of people watching them , and things like that will create a hue impact within the public .

In the other hand innovation is risky , but if companies do n't innovate they will asume more risk .
Many times companies try to sell a simple soft drink , and they could say is refreshing and tasteful , but sometimes this may not be enough , because they wo n't sell the amount of drinks they expect .
Is in this cases where the imagination plays a key role to make more attractive the items of what they really are .
Therefore to sell the same soft drink we are going to need to say !
If you really want to look cool , be the most known guy , and enjoy the delicious and refreshig taste of the soft drinks ..
you will need to try ( Drinky Way ) and you will see the difference !!
Unfair or not , in the end we have the same soda that taste exactly the same thing and nobody will be able to notice a difference with another brand , but the fact is the importance to know how to capture the buyer 's attention .

Finally we can say that in many situations customers will be dissapointed with their purchases , but they need to undersatand they cannot take verything they hear or see for granted
