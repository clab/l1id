Young people time is gold .
Although young people care about and are worried about it , time is not sufficient for them , while they have to do lots of things : study for their major , learning a foreign language , part-time jobs ...

I am focusing on those young students that are at the university , and that they are completely dedicated to their major .
Due to the fact that they are students they have to be more concetrated on preparing their major and prepare themselves to be better off , time for communiy activities is not as that much important .
But it all depend on what sort of activity are we talking about .
For example , working with non-gubernamental organizations , charities , is totally different from others .
With this kind of activity you can become more mature and have a different perspective in life .
Having these experience may help you in your future , thinking that there are some others that need more help than you .

What is more , this activities might be coordinated with your own and primary activities ( going to the university ) and sometimes it is not very easy .
I have a friend that is working as a volunteer in a charity , teaching people with physical disease how to cook on tuesdays and thursdays .
He loves it , but when he is in mid-term exams is impossible for him to attend this kind of course , because he need to focus all his time and energy in the subjects he has to prepare .

In conlcusion , it is true that young people do not dedicate time to help their communities but they have good reasons to explain and demostrate why the ca n't .
Maybe young people should reconsider the option of helping the others and make an effort to do it , but it 's still young peope decision .
