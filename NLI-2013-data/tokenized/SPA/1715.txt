My personal opinion towards this matter is that a person with a specialised academic subject tends to be more successful than someone who has a good general overview of most subjects .
By this I do not mean that a person with a specialised subject is more knowledgable than a well rounded person .

Someone who has studied a subject in depth and has received a degree for it , will be more prone to getting a good job in their field of study than someone who has a wider general knowledge but a shadier knowledge in a certain particular field .
Nowadays , a degree is perhaps the most essential element required in order to get a good job due to the increasing competitiveness for places .
Therefore , somebody who lacks this degree will not be as likely to get the job as someone who has perfected their field of study , as the latter is likely to be more efficient and to provide a company with a different and wider approach of the subject required .

Notwithstanding that it is important to specialise in a field of study , it is also essential to have a wide understanding of other aspects in life which could be helpful towards a career .
Through past experience , I have encountered people who concentrate on a subject and are probably near to being the best at it .
However , I have also noticed that some of these people lack basic skills such as socialising with others .
This is not a generalisation , but a partial observation .

In conclusion , it is vastly important to have a good knowledge of a certain field of study , but optimally , it would be better to have an equilibrium between the two , having a broad general knowledge as well as knowing substantialy about a certain topic .
