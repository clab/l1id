It 's very hard to generalize who enjoys life more , either young people or older people .
This usualy varies according to each individual 's personality and life story .
However , there are a few ideas and observations that make me assume that older people tend to enjoy life more .

Young people have more energy to live and constantly experience more things .
However , they may get caught up on the velocity of our modern world and not fully enjoy the everyday of their lives .
They have a thirst for something different all the time .
This insatiable craving can distract them from savoring each moment as somethig valuable and enjoyable .

Many times , young people confront difficult situations in which it appears that life is facing its limits .
The bad situations seem graver and can affect the younger mind , not being able to see the long term perspective that an older mind can more likely visualize .

On the other hand , older people live a life with a slower rithm , a life in which they can look back to what they have accomplished and enjoy where they stand today .
Individuals of greater age have more memories , and have experienced more situations , that can put them at ease with their expectations and make them enjoy the little things more than younger people .

Unlike young people , the elder usually have created families , that constantly bring joy to their lives .
The satisfaction of sharing the everyday moments with the poeple one loves , is something that comes with age , when one has had the time to value his beloved ones .

Even though one tends to think that young people are always more enthustiastic towards life and generaly more satisfied , in my experience , it is those who have lived longer that possess the key and secret behind true happiness .
