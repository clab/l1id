Broad knowledge on all the areas of knowing allows an individual to have intellect over many subjects , which are the academic subjects .
Primary and Secondary schools provide a person with the basic knowledge of all the areas concerning academic subjects .
However , when the individual enters an university level of education , the person starts to focus on a specific area , still making reference to others , but refering and specialazing in one area .
I believe that even though this focus on an area allows an individuals to develop a career on that topic where the individual 's interest is ; a broad knowledge of all academic subjects is fundamental and neccesary for the development and growth of the individual throughout its life .
Some of the areas of knowledge are the following : math , history , social sciences , natural sciences , and the arts ( literature , music , and plastic arts ) .
For an individual to entirely comprehend world conflicts and life situations it is demanded an atleast a general comprehension of these subjects .

Besides the knowledge of all these academics areas enhance the comprehension of the individual towards life , it permits the creation of connections between events through reason between them and to contribute more to the society .

Someone does not need to be an historian or an artist to comprehend these areas , but a basic knowledge on these amiliorate any difficulty in understanding them .
As a preceptor , the individual has to make use of reason and logic to make those conneccions which allow to understand , and also to create their own theories , their own conclusions regarding a topic .

Academic subjects are the tools given to individuals to have the start , the spark to create and make up its own criteria towards and subject , also the ability to discuss among a group of persons a topic and have basis to take and defend a stand .

For example , those members that work in the United Nations must have hollistic knowledge of the happenings of the world and must have the ability of recognize them , and to use all the areas of knowledge , along with the ways of knowing , to find possible solutions through the making of resolutions .
Even though there are the committes of human rights , E.C.O.S.O.C , disarmament and enviroment ; each member of this committe cant be stuck on only one of the subjects involved .
When looking to a conflict each one of them has to have the ability to look at the panoramic view , denominated the birds view , from that of the narrow view , the ants view .
This is what separates us from animals , the ability to reason , to identify a problem and search for a solution , using our most valuable tool which is our knowledge .

In conclusion , to have a better comprehension of the world , of conflicts , of life the individual must have a broad knowledge of all the acaemic topics , because they are all interrelated , and this builds up the persons own personal criteria towards anything , this makes it possible for discussions between U.N. memebers concerning possible solutions towards the impovement of a better world .
