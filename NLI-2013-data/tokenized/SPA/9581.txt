Recently , I recieved an anonymous , yet very impressive , e-mail power point presentation that made me reflect and musitate on various philosophies of life .
On of these specifically captured my attention : `` To achieve something you have n't met with before , you must do something , well , that you have n't done before . ''
Certainly , successful people do capture fame because they have ventured out into a sea of opportunities rather than stay safely in a boat .

Literature has supported the idea that success arrives after an original challenge has been overcome .
In the epic of Gilgamesh , the hero directs himself to try to gain immortality by traveling to the end of the world .
Though he misplaces the final flower of youth , Gilgamesh acknowledges a sudden sense of completion in his being and a spark of energy to change his kingdom .
Gilgamesh 's goal of gaining immortality does complete itself , as is stated at the end of the epic poem , when his name is recorded in history and remembered throughout subsequent generations .

However , the greatest examples of succes involving risk come to us in history .
Several names pop into my head : Ghandi , Mother Teresa , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Betty Williams , Nelson Mandella ...
All of these people participated and led heroic acts against the standards and conventions of society , against the expectancy of the crowd , and gave us , the present day generations , life , liberty , and justice .
If this fails to ring up the word `` success '' in my ear , I do not know what will .

Finally , personal experiences have rendered this belief of the correlation between risk and succes true .
Two years ago , I decided to try out for my school 's soccer team .
I played midfield , but I settled for goalie just because the team needed one .
This position actually scared me , but , nevertheless , I kept practicing to develop my latent abilties .
Incredibly , I became an all-star goalie .
Even today , I have been invited to compete in the Junior Olympics as a keeper .

All in all , success usually involves some type of risk .
Progress , innovations , and fame all resulted from wild attempts to change .
in this case , `` change '' is the key word .
A transformation from safe to highly challenging equals a tranformation from loser to victorious .
