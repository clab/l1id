Enjoying life depends on a decision and not on a the age or the circumstance that a person is going through .

I have known many old people who are happier and healthier than many teenagers and adults .
I know , for example , a 60-year-old woman who has more energy than two teenagers together .
I might be exaggerating , but her attitude toward life impresses me a lot .
She swims every day , she goes to the beauty parlor all the weekends and she has her own business .
In fact , she told me last time that she won the first place in a 2000-meter swimming competition in the Atitlan Sea .
She is also the most hyperactive person that I have ever known .
She likes to joke and she is smiling everytime I look at her .

On the other hand , I know a 30-year-old man who always wakes up tired and upset and who hates his job .
When I go to visit him , he is either eating or watching Tv .
I sometimes do not like to talk to him , because he is always speaking negatively .
His bad attitude sometimes scares me .

Because of this two examples given , I believe that enjoying life does not depend on someone 's age .
I am sure that the woman , whom I wrote about , wakes up every day expecting something new and that she is thankful that she has a new day to experience .
She has a possitive attitude and she is the one who decides to have a special day .

The other man could have a terrible job and a terrible house , but if he wants and decides to make of them something pleasant and enjoyable , he will make a paradise out of it .

It conclusion , I disagree with the statement .
Happiness depends on the person 's attitude and decisions .
