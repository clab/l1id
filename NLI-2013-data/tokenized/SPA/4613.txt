We live in a world where , one of the most important things is the image .
We have to pay attention to our physical image , the impresion that we cause to other people .
It is a normal behaviour of human beings but nowadays we are taking that to the extrem .
But why ?
Very simple ...

In our daily live we are recieving lots and lots of information or advertisements from every where we go or we are , for example if we switch on the television we see advertisements , if we are on the road we see advertisements on the sides of the road ...
WE are constantly under the effect of the advertisement and it affects to our lifes !
But not every thing that we see in the advertisements it is true .

I agree with the statement because in most part of the advertisements they show you a product better than what you are going to obtain if you buy it .
One example , the famous chain of fast food restaurants Mc Donald 's always give false images of their products in their advertisements .
On the television you see a great and fabulous hamburger with the best possible ingredients and you think that is imposible to find a better hamburger in the world .
Then one day you go to a Mc Donald 's restaurant with some friends and you ask for a hamburger , ( because you believe that you are going to receive what you seen on television ) , and surprise surprise !
what you receive is a hamburger that you can do best in your own home !

What I want to say with this is that it is true that they lie us in advertisements , but the problem is that we used to believe in what they say .
And what we have to do is to be conscious that we are seeing lies and we have to expect less that they told us .
Because if we pay attention to advertisements everyday and we believe what they say , it will affect to our live and it si not the best influence that we can receive .

Then netx time you see an advertisement , use your mind and your inteligence and be clever !
