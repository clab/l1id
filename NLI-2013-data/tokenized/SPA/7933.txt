Traveling in a group led by a tour guide could be a great alternative especially of you have never been in a place before .
Taking a tour guide could take you to the most exciting places and also you could learn about the history of it .
However there is another option that you have if you want to travel , which is travelling by your own .

Traveling by your own is a challenging experince where someone is taking a risk .
In spite of , he is his own guide , so he could go wherever he wants , in any time of the day .
Imagen that I am traveling to a country that I have seldom heard about it , but I did not want a tour guide .
This means that I could get loose , specially if I do not know where I am going throw .
Nevertheless , I can get some information about this place before I go , investigate the most exciting places and things that it could do and selected it according my own likes .

On th other hand , tour guides usually takes you to memorial places related to the history of it , which some people found it boring .
Instead they would prefer to visit beaches , cities , taste traditional dishes , etc .
This could be done if you travel by your own , without the feeling that you had payed for something you did not enjoyed and that you are wasting money on it .

Finally , when you travel by your own you can spend as much time as you want in one place than in other .
Case that is not posible in a tour group because each visit is specifilly measured so that you have to adjust your time as the schedule thay have plan .
