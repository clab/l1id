Based on my personal experience , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , than it is for them to learn facts , because the understanding of ideas and concepts prepare the students to use this knowlege in furter situations .

Fact learning may be usefull too , but is not as effective as understading the main idea .
For example , there are many students that learn the facts to take a test .
They might get a very good grade , but they do n't hold the information for much longer , because they learned almost every especific details and tempted to repeat them exactly as they read it .

On the other hand , students who understand the idea and concept of the topic do n't eassly forget it and can not only get a good grade , but also use this information later in a conversation about the topic or an exam where the students are tested for their general knowledge .

If is more effective , for example , in a math class for the student to understand where the formula comes from and how it applies , that only to learn it .
In my personal experience with diferent math teachers in my school , I retained the lectures in my brain of those teachers who made us resurche and understand the formula , than those that just gave it to us and gave us a lot of excercises to practice .

Another reason would be , that the students that learn to understand ideas and concepts are also learning to think on their one , not like students who learn facts , they tempt to be more insecure , because they learned to register the information exactly as it has been given to them and they do n't develop the abbility to agree or disagree with it .
