Nowadays , be succesful is very difficult .
This means , as I think , try new things and not to be always doing what our boss tell us every day .

But , unfortunately , we live in a capitalism world , where the economy and the consume are the most important things of our live .
This makes that normal people , like us , have to work in order to earn money to live , and because of that , take risk rather than only doing our job , is a very difficult thing .

This is the principal reason because a lot of people go to the University .
The want to study something which could give them the oportunity to earn a lot of money in a future , and to live as always the have dreamt .

But , other people , go there in orther to improve their known , because they are interested in some topics , like neurology , medicine or science , which could give to the humanity a better life and very important discovers .
These , are succesful people .
Their main topic is learn as much as they can , take risks if they have to and do whatever they can in order to solve a problem .

We have to mention aswell , that since the XXI century , it is real that bussiness are improving their workers and the give more importance to look for succesful people because probably for them , it will be much more effective .

Finally , This means that people which can solve problems of the bussines are much more valorated , and there , we can see difference between a succesful which would learn as much as he can about the problem , trying to solve it , and the second one , who probably would ask for help to another person in order to solve the problem .
