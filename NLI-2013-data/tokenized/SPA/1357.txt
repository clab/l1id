I think it is depens on the kind of thing that you need to do .
Both have advantages and desavantages .
For instance if we are talking about the president of a country is better to have broad knowledge of different subjects , on the other hand if we are thinking on research or investigated an specific problem could be better to have someone specilized in the matter .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allow people make decision with a wider range of things to take in account , and would be good because you know more information .
But the problem could be that you only have general information , then if it is necessary to have more details you could be in troubble and It is for sure that you will ask for someone else to help you .

Specializing in one specific subject is excellent to solve problems related to an specific topic or activitie , because you need full data research and experience , however , many times it is helpful to consider a completly different topic or mechanism , for example to solve environmental problems in textil industry have been used many principles of tannery processes .
Then The tannery industry saved some research time to textil industry

It is means , that always is better complement ways to do the things and to have both kinds of academic formation , because each one is suitable and sometimes better for a differents purposes .
