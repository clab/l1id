You did your reseach and chose a very good tour .
You brought your map , your back pack , your camera and some candy for the trip .
You expect to cover every single city that the program includes .
Sounds great ! ...
but you just found out ( already on the bus , train , whatever ) that you have 30 min to spend in each place , and you start to think that it is not what you expected ...

Well , that is what commonly happens when you travel in a group , with a tour guide ( policeman ) , checking on you every step of the way , fixing your schedule , telling you not to roam to far and sometimes even telling you what to eat .

Traveling in a group means that you are part of a bunch of people going to every place together , sometimes having to hold conversations that you do n't want to have , and observing a schedule that is not even suitable for you .

Even though traveling in a group could have good things , as for example , you can cover a lot of areas and places in a specific time , because every thing is scheduled , you should also have to deal with the contraints of it , that commonly gets traduced to frustration and that sense of `` not enough time '' in certain places , museums , city of even a sidewalk .

For us that like to have more time to spend freely while traveling , and being open for the espontaneus stuff , it is certainly not the way to go !
I prefer to travel by myself , in order to have the liberty to decide what I would like to do in a specific moment .
If a would like to stay for one more day in a specific city I can just ask myself ( and my wallet ) to receive an answer and that 's all .

In conlcusion , I believe that if you want to visit a lot of places in a short period of time , and have somebody to control your agenda , traveling in a group is for you .

But if you want to have a more local perspective of places , and the opportunity to decide in the moment wether what to do , stay away from the traveling groups !
