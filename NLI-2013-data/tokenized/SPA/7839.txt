When you are plannig a trip you can think that it is not big deal , you can even make reservations and buy the gear necessary for your vacations , but maybe your trip will not end as well as you first tought .
The hotel was not as beuatyful as it was in the photo you saw on the internet , the plane was not in a really good shape , and the service was just not worth what you paid for .
Publicity can be deceaving , and you can end up being a victim of it .

So , why is it better to join a group to go on a trip ?
First of all , everybody can share previous travel experience , discuse about the destination you are going to visit and agree to spend your free weeks in a safer , kinder , cheaper place .
But the bad side of group traveling could show up when members of the group have very diferent opinions of what a good trip is , so arguments will be right around the corner .

You may have an idea of the kind of vacatios you want , and you have calculated the money you are going to spend , but they will provide you with all the services you need , and the final cost of your trip could be lower than going by yourself .
A tour guide is specialized in organizing trips , is their job , they are professionals in that field , and they make their living that way .
A good tour guide will consider your taste to send you to the correct place , so you will be happy with the service and you will return to hire them .

If we talk about security , definitly you will be safer in a tour guided travel , because they have everything planned , so you wo n't have to look for your own transportation risking your security .
You wo n't have to be anxious trying to understand the road maps , or trying to figure out the schedule of the train station ...
and most important , you wo n't get lost in a city that have ever been before .

And if you are traveling in a group leded by a tour guide you will get the beneffits of both , wish is a more secure trip , a better service and better prices , all translated in more fun and great memories .
