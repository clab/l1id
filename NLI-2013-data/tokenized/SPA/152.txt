Now a days , the media is flooded with advertisement .
From medicnes to sports , form food to cars , the media comunicates to the world new and sophisticated products every day .
However , many of these new products seem to be idealistic and fantastic to be true , thus questionning its reliabilty .
For example a medical drink for fat people that does not involve diets or doing sports .
I belive that modern advertisement is in fact the new type of propaganda , the media is flooding our minds with half truths and half lies at the same time .
The new machines for indoors sports are a typical example of this .
New machines that are suppose to work magnificiently over a small period of time , are not only expenseive , but also inneficient .

On the other hand , the poor reliability of adverstisement was imposed by ourselves .
The consumerism society we live in is constantly demanding for perfection , so that is why adverstisment tend to alter or bend the truth to some extend .
For example , if I see an advertisment about a restaurant , it is not enough for me to see the quality of the food they sell as their product , but it is more interesting if they tell me about the quality of their product , like how good their meat is , or how tastefull the bread is .
Therefore , this need of flare in comunication ways has created , for me , a different ideas of the products offered in a certain piece of adversitsement .

Although this may be true , occasionally some pieces of advertisement are really reflecting the true image of the product they are selling .
For example , machines and technology to make our daily lives easier , like new blender machines or washers , trully performe to the level the advertisemtent says it does .
However , for oneself , it may no be the case but the reason for this is that the machine is misused or its purpose misunderstood .

In conclusion , I believe advertisement sometimes exagerrates products , but also , sometimes it is us that cannot use them appropiately .
Therefore i belive that although advertisements do make products better , we must also be carefull on how we judge these advertisements an if we truly understand how the product works or to waht end .
