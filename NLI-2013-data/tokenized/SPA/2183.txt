There are many young and old people who are enjoying their lives in different ways .
However , there are people who believe that the only time to enjoy the life is with early years .

I disagree with this statement because I think that older people can enjoy there lives more than young people .
For example , I met and got to know some older people here in Canada after coming from my home country .
I found out that these older people have older bodies but their mains are still fresh .
They want to do many things that they were not able to do when they were younger .
As an illustration , Reg is 75 years old and he goes to The Florida every year to watch some sport that he enjoys .
Besides , he drives his car from Sarnia Ontario where his has his house to The Florida , it is a long trip still for young people but he is able .

By the same token , some older people have enough money to pay to enjoy their lives .
these people have worked hard all their life so after doing this for many years , they think about start doing something different life spend time traveling aroun the world .
in addition , these people want to spend more time with their families instead of spending time working .

Another fact about this topic is that older people can teach young people like me to enjoy the life .
I try to spend time with older people because They tell me about their experience trought their lives , for example I meet once a week with an older man who has a grat sent of humor .
I try to learn from him many thing that I can use in my life .

In conclusion , young people should try to follow the way how some older people spent their time many years ago .
These older people always have something to share or give in order for younger people to learn how to spend the time in a correct direction .
Besides , these older people do n't want young people to waste their time in activities that can spoil their life
