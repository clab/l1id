To talk about the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' I must first confess that I 'm a marketer .
I studied marketing and I worked in marketing , and it is our job to make products look as good as we can , and sometimes we do magnificent job .
So with that said , yes , I do agree with the statement , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertising is created to make people buy products or services , that 's the only reason why companies spend so much money advertising .
Advertisements are designed thinking on the consumer , is for the consumer and it needs to convey to the consumer that the product is awesome , the best .
Not all products advertised are awesome , not all are garbage , but it is the advertisement purpose to show the product as good as it can be shown .

One example of advertisement that shows the product much better than it really is , the new Coke Black .
`` It 's coke and it 's coffee '' , `` it 's the BEST of both worlds '' .
Yeah right ! , the product it 's horrible and yet their advertisement is so inviting and you really think you are going to get coke with coffee and that the combination is going to work .
I mean , I love coke and coffee why not together ?
Well it just does n't work but their ads sure do .

Another example would be the IPOD .
Ipod 's ads are so fresh , it makes you feel like dancing .
But Ipods are really not worth the price .
It 's only because their ads are good that our perceived value for an ipod is higher .
I had an ipod , it broke two months after I bought it and in the ad it looked like it was a great product .

The last example I will give has to do with telemarketers .
Creams that will cure acne or creams that will get ride of unwanted hair , well I tried both and neither worked .

Advertisement purpose is to advertise so people buy or request servicesIt is its job to make products seem much better than they really are .
