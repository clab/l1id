I have to say before entering this topic that we can not know what will happen in twenty years or even if cars will circulate around .

But , if everything continious to progress as it has been doing for the last ten years I think that hopefully , there will be lots of cars but not as much as today .

The reasons are that globalization is making us move around the globe more than ever before but also more quickly .

Another task to have in mind is that cities are expanding , and this makes it impossible for cars to succesfully attend the requirments of people in terms of transport .

So , if we have to cover longer distances in a shorter period of time i think it will only be possible if public transports become more accesible to people , more confortable and , of course , more efficient .

Also for longer distances , air transport but speacially trains will bring the solution to the problem .
Trains are more confortable in terms of working experience ( for example with a laptop ) , reading , having meetings or conversations , than in planes where taking off and landing do not permit nearly anythything .
Of course between places where there is sea or ocean in between planes are the only option , and i also think that they will continue to imprive in many aspects .

But returning to the city ( where by the way i have more experience ) , the rush hours are a complete waste of time .
Governments and private institutions need to promote public transports or for example taxi cabs .
This transports have two main benefits .
The first one is that people in charge of driving are not in a hurry so the will drive more carefully .
Also they will know the better way to follow and will transport more people in less space ( what does not necessary mean that you can not breath ) .

The best example would be the metro ( or underground ) .
Cities like Paris or NY need to invest in their metro services ( witch are old and smell really bad ) , but others like Madrid have invested a lot in it and , not in twenty years but now , today , there are less cars than before .
Also cities where motorbikes and bikes are promoted experience a big fall in the number of cars .
