Nowdays , the promotion of the products that the population normally use is made by the different kinds of advertisements , and most of these advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
And since the attention of people is generally called by what is shown , they are therefore called to buy the products shown n the advertisements , and these products are not what they thought .

A person may usually go to buy a product that has just appear and that he or she saw about it on television .
For example , a new type of shampoo has just appeared , and had been promotioned on tv , and lots of advertisements are all over the city .
Since is said about this product that a new chemical had been included on the general composition of it , and this chemical will help maintaining the hair , that it would make it growth , and it would make it look better , which means : the best product made by now , whoever person would feel the need of buying it since it would help them , and the advertisements are showing the advantages of buying this new idom ; so , this person buys it and uses it , but it does n't bring the results that she or he waited for , instead , it kind of has the opposite effect , in conclusion , almost nothing of what the advertisement showed was real .

In general , people usually make use of the new idoms promotionated by the different advertisements of them , just because it looks as though they are a better option to buy , and the advertisements make sure of showing off the best features of the product they are promotionating but ignoring some other ones that may make change the opinion of buying the product , so the products look like they are the new revolution , they are something better that they really are , and is the work the advertisements have to do , sell products .
The thing is that people almost never make sure that the product they are seeing is the same , because they trust all the masive media that show off the products .
Advertisements shw how everything ges into eyes first .
