There are a lot of people , most of them young people , who say that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it truth ?
Well , to be honest I agree .
I think young people enjoy life a lot more that older people do for the following reasons .

In first place , young people are experimenting everything that older people already did .
They have more energy and fisically they are able to do , what sometimes older people ca n't do .

Older people is most of the time tired or in bad mud and they do n't want to do anything .
I 'm not saying that all of them are like that but most of them sometimes become angry people and they live their lives so .
Instead young people is ancious to live their lives and to have the experiences older people had .

For example , I 'm a young person and I think I have such much more fun than my parents do !
It is obviuos .
That 's because they have a lot of responsabilities and a lot of things to worry about .
But for me is a lot different , because I do n't have kids , I do n't have to work and I do n't have to worry about anything , but the school and doing my homework .
I can do a lot of things they ca n't , for example I can watch TV on the afternoon all the time I like but my parents have to go to work so they ca n't or I can go out on the weekends with my friends but some times it 's impossible for my parents to go out with their friends .
And I think that all these things make that some persons become like that .
Of course with all those things they ca n't enjoy life like young people do .

So that , these maybe some of the reasons why people say that and in my opinion it 's truth .
