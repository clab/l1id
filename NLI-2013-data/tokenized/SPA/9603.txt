I agree with the statement for a several reasons :
1. One may not success at the first try , but eventually if one keeps trying , one will encounter success .
Unsuccessful people do n't realize that success takes time and effort .
They want it to be done at the first time , and that does not always happen !
There are several stories about inventors who did not give up and tried several times , even thousands of time !
The inventor of the light bulb is one that comes to my mind .
Imagine what would have happened if he would have given up after all those tries !
But he kept trying and trying until he did it !

Of course , that does n't mean to get stuck with something that does not work , which takes me to the second reason why agree with the statement .
2. I think successful people know when to change , or try a different approach .
If something is not working , then know when to quit and try it in another way !
Do n't give up but do n't obsess either .
Maybe take a break and look it at a different angle .
Like the chemist who could not figure out the chemical composition of an element , and discovered it during a dream , when he dreamed of a snake biting its tail .

3. Life is constantly changing , and one can not stay the same without changing .
New technologies are developed on a daily basis , and you can not lock yourself in a shell and pretending change is not happening outside .
Whether you like it or not , you have to try new things , or you 'll stay behind .
That 's what successful people do .

4. People fear that if they take risks they will loose the few things they have now .
But they fail to realize that they are having a major loss with the cost of opportunity for not using your resources and take a risk .
They would gain much more if they were willing to risk what they have or their time .

5. Also , in addition to these reasons , successful people know when to ask for help , and work in a team .
One can acomplish more if one has support from other people .
