I personally believe the statement above to be false .
It is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects but at the same time it is crucial to be specialized on something if one wants to be successful .
A well-rounded individual is not good enough when it comes to living through life .

Schools teach pieces and bits of every subject to students .
This is the part of their intelectual career in which they are introduced to all the different areas of knowledge ; when their basic fundemantals are created .
In this stage the student is able to explore all the different areas , and decide which of these is his / her interest .
This does not mean that the student has to pick one , but at least narrow down the list .
Once school is over , students have their basic pillars of the academic subjects created .

College is the next step to specialization .
Students now decide where they want to specialize .
If everybody had broad knowledge on everything and no specialities , society would not function correctly .
A town needs a baker , a doctor , and a blacksmith ; these are not tasks that can be accomplished by everyone .
For example , farming is a task that requires a lot of knowledge on the subject and dedication .
If everybody had just some broad knowledge on the subject , crops would not grow very efficiently , so there might not be enough food to support the town .
The town would not be able to survive if there are no professionals in each area since all the jobs that have to be done would not be accomplished to their best .

It is fundamental to be introduced to all the areas of academic knowledge , to have a broad understanding on each subject area , but that is not enough for a society to function .
In a society there has to be a certain degree of organization in order for it to run as expected : individuals should comprehend what their role in society is and fully accomplish it in order to run smoothly .
If everybody is specialized on something he/she likes , then the task will most probably be done as best as possible , and at the same time , as a whole , form a well-rounded society .
