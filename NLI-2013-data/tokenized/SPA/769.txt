In this world you can find people who have a broad knoledge of many academic subject which can do lot of very basic things and people who are specialized in one specific subject and can resolve very complex problems about a subject .
I do not agree with the statement because he following reasons >

First of all in a laboral enviroment people specialized in one specific subject are more likely to be hired , because they have a bigger knowledge about the job what are they going to do .
for example > when you have a cardiac desease you would prefer go to a cadiologist with a PHD to go to a doctor who know just a little of every desease because you do not know if he or she can help you .

My second reason why is that is easier to know a little of lot of subjects than have a specialized knowledge about one subject , what I mean with this is that someone specialized in one subject can learn easier a little of lot of subjects than someone who has a broad kwnoledge of lot of subjects .
for example > If I am specialized in a subject I can after start to read about diferent thing and learn aout it a little , while if I am someone who just know a little about some things i have to study very hard o have the specialized knowledge .

In conclusion because a specialized is more required in a laboral enviroment than someone who just has a basic knowledge and because is easier o become in someone with a general knowledge I disagree with the statement .
