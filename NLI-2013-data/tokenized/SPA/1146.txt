Many people believe that professionals need to specialize in one specific subject in order to succeed in their own careers , while others are convinced that the broader knowledge you have , the better .
I think that a wide knowledge of many academic subjects is the best option for achieving a successful career .

There has been a long debate regarding this issue and education specialists gather in different conferences to debate about the diverse educational systems around the world , and analyze their advantages and disadvantages .
The current trend states that in order to gain academic recognition , professionals need to specialize as much as possible in one specific subject ( the more specific , the better ) .
This specialization implies studying not only a Bachelors Degree on the issue selected , but also Masters courses and , why not , PHDs .
Following this formula , you could be the most specialized person in the world about one specific area , and you will get plenty of jobs related to the issue .

Some oppositors to the current vision states that nowadays , with all the fast changes that societies pass through , people need to be prepared with a wide package of tools and a broad knowledge in order to respond quickly to new challenges and deal with different situations almost everyday .
That 's why they suggest that having as much knowledge as possible on different academic areas would help a lot in achieving a successful professional career .

I personally agree with this second point of view and with all the reasons stated to support it , and I could give some concretes examples about my personal experience in my career that could help to better illustrate my position .

Even though the first career that I studied was journalism , after that I decided to enroll in a wider subject and I studied Sociology .
That second Degree gave me a much broader approach to social sciences and helped me to get better jobs , because now I could work not only as a Journalist , but also as a Sociologist , and both areas complement each other during my daily routine .

To conclude , I would say that learning as much as possible about many different topics could help people building a successful professional career but , most importantly , could make them grow as human beings , while learning new and diverse things every day .
