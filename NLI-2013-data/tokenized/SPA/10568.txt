Most of the people that had succed in such a great way in life usually go thruogh a long and a risk progress to get to where they are now .
Who said life what 's supposed to be easy ?
the reality is that is not and a lot people do n't want to face reality .
Some people just wish everything would just fall right in their hands , but that is not the point in life , we are here for a reason , we have hands for a reason , and that is to make a good use of them .
Sometimes people do n't realized all they can do and they get satiesfied with one thing that they know they 're good at .
Taking risks is not always safe , but it can take someone to a higher level .
In the United States there are so many opportuties and so many ways you can explore things in life that will help you to become someone in life .
In third world countries like Africa and Latinoamerica people have to face a lot of challenges everyday in life , because there are not many opportunities in their countries they take dangerus risks such as leaving their countries .
A great example of it are the many ilgegal immigrants latinoamericano that the United States has , because of the difficulties that people have getting a job and trying to provide for their families , they immigrate to countries like the U.S. to try to see their dream come true in life and to make a difference .
Many of this people have reach their goal but there are others that have n't , because that 's just how life is but they still try and that marks something in their path .

In life you have to be willing to do a lot of things around you that not may always look easy but at the end the results are worthy , and you can just look back and apreciate what you 've done
