Nowadays is a lot of disccusion about what is more important in the process of learning in the students , we have two possible answers : the first one is to understand ideas and concepts , and the second one is to learn facts .
I think that the answer for this could be finded in the requeriments that the majoriy of jobs have to day .

Usually in jobs the people have to take decision all the time , for that you need to understand the advantages an disadvantages of the possible chooses , and have a good idea of the consequences of your decision .
I am going to explanin how the two process - understand ideas or learn facts - can help , or not , the people to adquire the capability to take decisions .

In one hand we have the idea of just learn facts .
How you can learn something you can repeat the concept a lot of times , but you do n't understand wat you are saying .
In the other hand , if you understan a idea , you can answer a new question because yuo have in your mind a possible path to obtain the answer .
For example when I child learn to multiplicate just repeting the tables of multiplication , he knows this specific operations , but if you ask a new one he can anwer , because he do n't now how to multiplicate two numbers .
But if you teach a boy how fuction the multiplication , the child can answers any question becasue he knows how to obtain the answer .
Another fact , that is important , is that when you just learn the concepts if you forgetted you can do anything .
But in you learn how to obtain an answer by a logical way , I am sure that you always can be available to answer .
Finally I strongly believe that the concepts are not necesary to learn , inasmuch as they are always in the books .

In conclusion , I thinks that the best way to learn somethink is to understand the ideas and te concepts .
Because is preparig you the the laboral life
