Young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinion , young people take more chances and risks , as well as they try to experience numerous things when they get a chance .
This because they have been presented more options in life , they are not as careful with their health as older people are , and they like to try new things in every occasion they can find .

Life has evolutionized and changed in many aspects in this last century .
Young people like to take chances and go for what them want .
They tend to look beyond what is presented to them , and go beyond what is traditionally expected .
Sometimes the choice of something new and different may not be there , but young people will look for it , they will expand their horizons and go further out their boundaries .
Old people have more traditions to follow .
Family values are strongly present in their daily lives , so they have to follow certain life styles that young people are not very interested in .

When taking a risk , their is always a fifty percent chance it might work or it might not .
That is what taking a risk involves .
Older people are most conservative and might be more afraid to take a risk .
A young person is starting his or her life , and might see things differently .
They could see their future as an uncertainty for the present time , and might be less skeptical to go for it and take the risk of losing something .
Different than older people , they might not have a family to provide to or worry about .
They might only need to worry about themselves .
The value of things is less important , because it might only have a monetary value , and not a sentimental value .
This because they are young and have not been around for a long time .
Older people might appreciate things more , since they have been here for longer .
They apply more value to things like a bracelet or ring , than just a financial price .
A young person might think that if they lose it , they can replace it from any jewelry store .

Some experience comes from practice .
It can be practice that takes a long time to achieve or simply practice that can be learned quickly by doing it a lot in a short period of time .
Older people are supposed to have more experience than young people .
But it might be in fewer areas .
Young people like to experience new things and try differrent things .
They are more open and know that the world has many different things to offer , so they try most of them or as many as possible .
They are young and healthy , which allows them to travel easier , and eat more ethnic foods .
In the other hand , older people have to take better care of their bodies , since their health is more at risk .
They ca n't travel long distances and might need medications that are not always available everywhere .
So they are not able to enjoy life as much as young people can .
