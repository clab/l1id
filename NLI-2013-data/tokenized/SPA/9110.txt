I do not agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''

Facts are points of information which are a hundred percent right , cannot be denied and can be proven right an infinite amount of times .

The law 's of gravity are examples of factual information .
This information can never be proved wrong therefore it is important for a student to learn this rather than information that could be wrong .

Concepts and ideas also have a huge amount of importance regarding the education of a student however it is not as inporntant as factual information .
this ideas are only someones theories and thoughts , they have n't been proved right yet .
When theories or ideas are proven to be right they become facts .

When comparing these two types of information one must look at their origin .
If a fact is a theory or idea that has been proven to be right the inportance of this information is therefore greater than the inportance of the ideas .

Students need to learn about laws or facts in order to really know how to approach and especific research .
Theories are very often rejected and replaced by others , this constant rejection of theories is why theories lose inportance throughout time .

There was a time when the earth was believed to be flat , this was a theory .
When technology gave men the power to actually investigate this theory the idea was rejected and therefore replaced by a fact , that the earth is round .
Correct knowledge is what actually matters in a student 's education .
If the information learned was wrong then there is no purpose on learning that .

Ideas and concepts still play a huge factor because in order to investigate something there must be a theory and someone willing to prove it wrong .
I no one figured that the earth was flat it is likely that none would have tried to actually find out .

Therefore the inportance of each kind of information can vary and often depends on the students beliefs and goals .
If the student is more interested in scientific reserch then both kinds of informantion must be equally evaluated .
But if the students is in to less scientific or objective activities like art and music concepts and ideas play a bigger role .
