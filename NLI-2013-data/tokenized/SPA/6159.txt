I do n't agree with this statement about the decrease in the use of cars in a twenty year period .
Maybe a different concept in his use would be possible due to new energetic sources or changes in people 's way of life , but I 'm sure that cars are going to be as needful as today .

It is true that town halls in big cities are trying to convince their citizens about how harmful to the enviroment is everyday massive traffic .
Their politics are now trying to be more aware of this problem , but I do n't think they really know how to solve it .
They have built lanes for cyclists but , at least in Madrid , using them is really dangerous due to the urbanistic structure .

Another reason why I think that car 's users wo n't be reduced in the future is the way that big cities expand .
People normally live in the outskirts of the city and they need to go downtown to work .
How can they go to their jobs ?
They can use public transportation but that 's not a comfortable solution for them .
They could spend double of the time going that way than going by car .

Even if people concern about the pollution problem and they start using public trasnportation or their bikes , they will always need a car in case they want to travel to other city or visiting a relative living in the other side of the town .
I 'm talking about what is more comfortable and useful for them .

This is why I think that reducing the number of cars wo n't be possible in such a short period .
Alternative energies like hydrogen or solar , should be more investigated in order to use them in car engines .
This cars would n't harm the atmosphere and people could use their cars without feeling guilty .
