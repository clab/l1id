I think the best way to travel is in an group of people led by a tour guide becouse traveling will be more confortable to all of us and we all will get the information of the places we visit .
In the other hand traveling alone will be more expensive that traveveling in an group , costs will be split for all travelers .
I remember one time I traveled alone to mexico city and my money was really short but took the risk and I travel .
Then when I was in the city I realized that the best will be traveling with someone .
I spent the ninght with some friends becouse I had not enougt money to retourn to my city , then next time that I consider to tavel by my self would not be a option .

Traveling in an group not only have the economic benefit , you can meet people and have an nice long trip chating with new friends .

I met someone in a tour to Acapulco , and we all have fun I still have touch with them but they are n't in mexico anymore .

The best way to have my next vacation will be by having a tour guide , they may know more the city that I do , in fact that 's is their job , to show up the city and indicate the best way and places to spent time .

I will recoment to have a tour guide , family will have much fun that getting lost looking for some place in special .
that is really usual when get parents think that they already know about the place they will visit .

I agree with this point and will not get any tour by my self , not if I do n't the exactly information .
