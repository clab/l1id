What makes a person successful ?
Is it the amount of money they make , the car they bought with it , or the house they live in ?
I believe that success is more than just having a lot of money .
To be a successful individual a person has to go through many obstacles without stoping , and has to have a clear vision of the future .

We may find someone that is really good in a certain task .
But success is not just being good at something .
I believe that it means to be the best at it .
In the present times people go through life trying to grasp anything they can get .
There 's no such thing as easy money .
Because of the dificulty of getting a job , paying bills , and having enough money to pay for your child 's $ 30,000 per year education , many people have found themselves absorbed by life 's preassure .
They stoped thinking about the future and have focus in the present .

I believe people have become conformists and many mediocre .
They are tired of working so hard and not improoving , so when they finally find something that 's OK , they 'll stay with it because they are too afraid of loosing the little something they 've got .
Most humans do n't feel confortable in an unknown environment .
This makes it hard for these people to take a risk and move towards the unexplored .
They do n't care if it 'll bring something better .
The fear of change disables them to become better .

So a successful person is not the one that stays with what he or she already knows how to do well , but rather that other person who takes the risk and searches for self improovement .
It is not enough to have one goal in life .
What are you supposed to do when you acomplish it ?
Are you done ?
Is there no other reason for you to keep on living ?
I truellly think that a successful person will always have something more to acomplish .
miving from one objective to the next will make you go higher than being passive and staying in the secure zone .
