I 'm agree with the statement above , because usually the companies want to have more costumers and they start the publicity for this .
They just show in commercials the best things of their products , but they do n't give the costumer all the true .
For example if you go to a fast foods restaurants , they have meals cheaper than meals that you can find in other kinds of restaurants .
It 's true it 's cheap meal , but also is small , and it can affect the health of the costumer , because its nutritional facts will can damage the regular system of the body in the future .

In other hand , if you go to the clothes store , obviously you want to see the best and the cheapest dress that they have , but the problem is , in some cases , that they do n't have your size , the clothes there is just for thin women and you ca n't wear it .
They just show the price and how beautiful is the dress but they do n't say that the clotes in this store is just for `` unreal women '' .

I think that the owner of this types of companies are also costumers , and for this , they have to think like that .
If they want more costumers , more sales , so more money , they have to know exactly what the `` real people '' need to wear , to eat , or just to live healthy .
I come from another country and the first time when I realized the way of I 'll have to live my life here , I thought `` I 'm going to have many problems '' , because in my country the life is slower than here , and we have time to think about ourselves .
We have some more time to cook , to have a good times with our friends , but we also are more lazy than American people and just think about the party time .
I think because American people do n't have enough time for cook or do differents things , they make everything easiest for everyone , and is why they just show the best of their products with do n't care about the things that can cause a damage ( the fry meal ) to the costumers .
