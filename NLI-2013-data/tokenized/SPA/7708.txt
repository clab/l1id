When you travel somewhere you have never been , you want to learn everyting and explore every part of that place .
To accomplish this you may need to form part of a group and be lead by a tour guide .
By doing this , you make sure that you are going to learn many facts .
The downside of this kind of traveling is that you are not going to have the chance to explore by yourself .
You need to decide wether you are going to be part of a group led by a tour guide or if you are going to explore and learn by yourself .

Usually you go to a museum or you visit an historical monument with a tour guide .
This tour guide will help you learn the history behind the paintings or objects and will also give you great facts .
The tour guide will be the instrument that will enable you gain the knwoledge you are looking for .
You can be sure that you are not going to miss an important detail or fact because the tour guide is going to give it to you .

At the same time , you may want to travel or visit a place without a tour guide .
By doing this , you can explore and see thing at your own pace without others telling you what to see and for how long .
When you travel by yourself , you have the liberty to decide your destination , the liberty to choose what you would like to learn .
This kind of traveling will let you appreciate things more because you are in charge what you are going to do .

In my personal experience , I prefer a balance of both .
A tour guide is important because you are going to learn important facts .
Also , whith a tour guide , you are going to learn many more and better things .
The only bad thing about traveling wiht a tour guide is that you are not going to have the freedom of seeing what you want or visiting the places you would like .
This is why sometimes I prefer traveling without a tour guide .
In this way I will decide what I want to see , I will decide the path I want to follow .
I can give an example of this on the time I went to Rome with my family .
We went to see the churches and the temples by ourselves , but we took a tour guide to see St. Peter 's Basilic .
I have to admit that with the tour guide I learned many facts about that church that I never imagined , but at the same time I did not see every part othe basilic I wanted to see .
If I had visited the church without the tour guide I probably would not have learned everything , but I may have seen what I wanted to see and visit .
