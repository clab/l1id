In my opinion it depends on what you want , it es very important to have an specialization on any career you gradute in .
But as an example if yo want to run a buisness yo can study managment and buisness administration and you could get a more efficient work in your buisness on another hand if you gradute from medicine why would you have another career in buisness i think the mos inteligent you can do is an specialization in wahtever you prefer in plastic cirugy , brain , phycology any thing you think it would be the best .
Another of my opinion i thing everybody goals should be the specialization in any thing they gradute in because that would make the diference between him an another from his same career and that would make the big companys and industries hhire him instead if the one that didint have de specialization , That does n't mean that if you dont you wont get hired you can always run your own buisness with just your degree or work for a small company and it can get to be a big one , So like i just said it just depends on want you want to do or be .
There is another argument i have you dont even have tu gradute or have an specialization in the part running a buisness as an example if you have the money and the contacts you could run it without graduating it dependes on your golas .
Closing my opinion I realy do think specialization does the diference between any one who gradutes from deferents career thats why the best and the more preparated they are , those are the one who are hired from the big companys by having more credits than the others in his same career so thats why every should every day try to prepare themselfs for diferentes thing and no one ever kwoswhat that could help us .
