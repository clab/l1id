People is talking about controversials things or topics .
One of these topics is if the next twenty years will be fewer cars or not .
Some people support the idea that there are going to be less cars and othres have reasons to think that the number of cars will go down .

On one hand those who support the idea that it will be fewer cars in the future , they think that oil is not going to be as cheap as today .
So if people have to pay more it will be not so used .
They also think that oil is not going to be there for ever .
Lastly the public transport is getting more popular than the car , that in big cities is slower On the other hand , the people that support that the number of cars is going to increase or at least by the same .
Firstly because is the main way to move and people is used to it , and changing that is dificult .
They also think that cars companys will change oil for other energy , that it will be cheaper an cleaner .
Lastly they think that car industry is too strong to stop it .

I support the idea that it will be fewer cars in the future .
Firstly because of the oil the cars need .
Not only because of the price also i think that people is reallising that cars consume too much oil , what is bad for the air that we breath .
Secondly i think that publis transportatio is getting better ( at least in Madrid , Spain ) , so some times is faster than the car , and sure that is cheaper than driving .
