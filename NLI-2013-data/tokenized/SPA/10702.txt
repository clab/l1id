Successful people try new things I agree that suceesfull people try new things and take risks .
How do you think all the people you see in newspapers , magazines , television , because of their achievements get there ?
There are three main reasons why : First because they try new things , second because they never give up , and third they have a positive attitude .

The first one is `` They try new things '' .
As the statement says people with success try new things .
If you are a person that does n't try to take risks because maybe it wo n't work , you 're never gonna triumph .
You will be a person that will end up working for someone , probably in a company that has a lot of success , when you can be your own boss by trying new things .
Instead of going out and find new possibilities to improve your life .

The second one is `` They never give up '' .
Of course everybody knows that for you to get to a goal you need to be constant .
You will fall , and not one time but several times , but thanks to those mistakes you will learn and you 'll make sure not to do them again .
But you need to stand up again and keep going , because if you do n't , you will never get to your final goal .
It 's like when you start walking you fall a lot of times , but at the end you end up learning , and walking .

Finally , is the `` They have a positive attitude '' .
This is a very important one .
Through out you life you will have to talk with other people .
To make bussiness with them , to make friends , to ask someone to be your girlfriend or boyfriend , to get something you want , etc ...
Communication is a very escencial thing in life , and each time you communicate people notice your attitude .
So if you 're a negative person that 's always stressed out or with an angry face , peaople will not want to hear , make bussiness , or be with you .
But if instead you are positive , and you 're nice and treat people well , you will succeed in life .
And even though you do n't believe everything is based in the way you think .

In conclusion I would like to say that if we all try new things in life we will be succesful persons .
Do n't go around life being afraid of trying new things , good things .
Because you will be privatizing yourself of many things and that can help you be a better person .
And as I said , everything is based in the way you think , and in the way you comfront each of your problems that life brings you , and if you open your mind to new possibilities you will have a lot of success in your life .
