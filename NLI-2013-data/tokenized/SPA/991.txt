On the history of modern civilizations the question of having broader or specialized knowledge has produced many conflicts .
Mostly , the question is evident in the academic realms that implact individual thinking .
A very brief look at three eras will help me to explain why I agree with having a general knowledge .

The modern idea of having an universal kowledge , led to the creation of universities and educational centers where humanism , as well as other subject were part of a cult individual - for me this is a person with a broad knowledge .
Then , the classic thinking - as well as the constant socioeconomic changes - brought the idea of being speciallized in order to compete in a work market .
Finally , the balance aroused from the interdisciplinary point of view that suggest the combination of subjects for getting a better understanding of the society .

In this context , I agree with the last one that promotes the idea of having a broader knowledge than a specialized one .
Even tough I accept not all of us are good in everything or have the ability of all fields `` know-hows '' , I sustain a tolerant person is one who moves easily from one knowledge to another and who respect other subjects ' complexity .

I think this is fundamental for keeping our academies open to new ideas and to academic as well as professional collaborations that can result from interdisciplinary views .
