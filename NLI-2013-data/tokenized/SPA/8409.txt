I think it is important for students both , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts .

If a student understands ideas and concepts he will analyze different positions about a topic and also can have discutions in class .
There are some ideas aond concepts that werw introduced in a particular fact .
So , concepts can help students to understand some facts , because a new concept that explains something can bring a change that became a fact .
For example a discover is a fact in which a person introduce a new concept .

Facts for students are very important in all the fiels of knowledge because it is the way that they can undertand the changes for instance in literature , or history .
There are some facts that shows a change for the people that are includend in this change .
When Cristobal Colombus discovered America was a fact that cause a change not only for all the people living in America in the fifth century , but also caused ne challenges and goals for people that came from Europe .
So a fact is important to understand all the period that follows it .

Concepts and ideas are basic for learning because they give students meanings in all the subjects of study .
In literature there are concepts that students may understand the different literature movements or concepts that some writers introduced in literature that now are important .
In Biology is important the concepts of living species : or in Geology , evolution of earth is a very fundamental concept , all the geological changes that have occurred are also facts that scientists concludend in some research projects .

In conclution , not only facts , but also concepts and ideas are very important for the learning process of a student because in some cases they are relationed and give the student details to understnad and learn in a beter way .
