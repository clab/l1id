Although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting , I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons .

Firstly , if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge , because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field .

Moreover , specialization is very important when you are a job seeker , particullarly when you are looking for your first job .
There is not any chance for people knowing many things in a superficial view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field .

I can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes , for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff .
But that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large companies .
Thus , the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself .
Usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert .

We can consider also this dilemma is the history .
If the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one , it would have been impossible such a fantastic development .

In summary , although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes , society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenges that we are facing , and for that the specialization must be a priority .
