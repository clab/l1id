In today 's world , cars a symbol of prosperity , social recognition and a sign of our own human identity .

The estatement appears to reflect on a common will from people in this world to live in a cleaner , more greener planet without the ongoing pollution and respecting a more sustainable environment .
I personally share the ideology ; however the trends seen during the past fifty years are just an evidence of the irrealistic idea that fewer cars will be in use in the next twenty years .

Even if new technologies arised from the most developed countries ; bringing to our lives new ways of communication , transport or even virtual imaging developement , the future of cars will remain very much alive and on top of the economic development of the 2030 vision of most of our social , political and economical objectives .
This is the way the world economy plays it 's major role balancing ressources to economics .

Perhaps , the increase and strong development of some emerging markets will participate in the rapid growth of new technologies permitting our over populating cities the benefit of welcoming new ways for public transportations such as : undergrounds , sky trains , electric public transportation or even interactive working environments permitting in such a way to find new ways for people to vehcile them selves from point a to b. However , even if this push drives the car industry to slow down in terms of their development , other factors will compensate its constant development such as lower costs and new fuel industries .

Another key element that adds to the above is obviously the increase amount of people living in this planet and the projections of their power expenditure in the rise for the future to come .

I do not believe that within the next twenty or so years , the world will give up one of it 's most precious inventions .
I am more confident that new technologies will ensure the establishement of better and more sustainable power energies that will enable cars and other motorized vehicles to maintain their competitive advantage , hence improving the quality of the product and the ability to protect our delicate eco system as desired by all of us .
