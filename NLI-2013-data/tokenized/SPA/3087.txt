I absolutely disagree with the given example .
Older people enjoy life the same or more as young people do .
This is due to the fact , that young people live life according to their expected future , creating this way a false sense of eternity .
Therefore , young people are unable to experience the marvellous mysteries and beauties of daily life .

On the other hand , it is well known , that older people live life more intensive .
Older people are capable of experiencing every second of their existence , because they are aware of their mortal destiny .

Life is based on experiences , life is what we create on a daily basis , but life has an ending .
Life is uncertain , but death is certain .
Everyday responsibilities have made young people , as myself , unaware of the reality of our existince , of the real meaning of life .
Life should not be just about completing assignments and working for a company , life should be something deeper .
But it is well known , that our industrialized society has made out of us working machines , and taken away our freedom to live life accordingly to our decisions .

As one grows , one is taught to be a person who dedicates most of its life to the well-being of the society in which one 's live .
Before , for example in my country , reaching 65 years , one is obliged to work , and one will be able to live only after turning this age .

This is an important reason , that explains why most of the young people are uncapable of enjoying life , the way they should , and why older people are capable to .
It is a pity , that most of the people in our society will start to live life just after having dedicated their entire life to society .
It is during this stage of life , when older people realize that their life is mortal .
It is during this revelation , that people start enjoying life more .
Every second is precious , and every second could be the last .

It is this fact of life that make older people enjoy life more than young people do .
