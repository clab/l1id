From my point of view , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are many reasons that suppport my opinion .

Now there are more cars in the cities than habitants , so it will not be suffer more time , too many traffic jams , slow traffic ...
that disturved the citizens ' life .
They probably , in twenty years , will not buy more cars .
The public services are improving every day .
Public busses , trains ...
make the life easier in the city .
People do not like to waste time waiting in their vehicles , so they are using public transportation more and more , this fact shows that in many years , people will not buy cars .
Moreover , goberments are intelligent , they offer excellent prizes in the public busses , with good conections betwen the cities and that makes easy the life without cars .
Futhermore , nowadays , we are suffering a lot of cars ' accidents , people are scared from that and the authorities will take decisions to stop it with paying lot of money if somebody drives so fast or if drivers are drinking and driving ...
In some many countries they can take your car off ..
In addition the air commications are being improving a lot , it makes faster travels around the world and through every country .
I believe that finally people will not want to spend five hours in the car in order to visit a relative if they can do the same trip in one hour by plane .
Also I think that citizens are concious of the huge pollution that cars produce to the enviroment .
In contrast , I believe that in twenty years will be more motocycles in the cities , because these are vey helpfull in there .

Base on the arguments that I have exposed about , it can be infered that I am agree with the statement .
