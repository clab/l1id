Tour guides are profesional people who help foreigners to understand and know everything about a country , this implies the country 's history and it 's landscape .
Sometimes , there are debates dealing with the best way to travel , wheter if it 's traveling in a group led by a tour guide or not .
We we will explain the benefits of traveling in a group led by one , the inconvenients of traveling without one , and we will conclude giving an agreement or disagreement of this traveling way .

First of all , traveling with tour guides represents the opportunity , not only to visit a county , but to get information about the country 's history and whats more , the country 's popular places to visit .
Indeed , a tour guide can give aditional information to visitors if they don not have even visited that country .
In fact , tour guides can be really helpful for bewildered people , guides can help them take a decision .

On the other hand , tour guides can limit someone 's liberty , people traveling in a group led by a tour guide are asked to remain with the group .
Thus people can not go wherever they want at any time they want .
Besides , it is interesting sometimes to discover a country by getting lost or by talking to people , living among them for a while , more than getting an image proposed by a tour guide .
In fact , tour guides might be influenced by their own likings or dislikings so visitors will be actually suggested , and have influenced decisions .

To conclude , I disagree traveling in a group led by a tour guide to an extent .
I think that if it is the first time a tourist visit a foreign country , it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide in order to get some information about the country so they could travel there again knowing something about the country , but this time without a tour guide , so tourists could leave some events to chance , discover the country , and live with people who live there .
Besides , traveling without a tour guide , can help making new friends because travelers will be no longer imposed to do something .
