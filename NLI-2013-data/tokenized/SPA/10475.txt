There is in my country an common and old proverb that says : `` Innovation is the mother of the success '' .
I have mentioned this proverb because I definitely agree with the idea that the most successful people try new things and take riks rather than only doing what they already know .
People who try to introduce and develop new ideas and take riks get good recognition and can achieve most often the succes .

If societies and business want to develop in a good way , they need to introduce innovative ideas and new developments .
For that , usually societies and businness appreciate so much the people who have new , creative , and innovative ideas .
In fact , societies and business give the best recognition and gives the best rewards to the most innovative people .

Additionally , the people who try news things achieve , under normal circunstances , the best results in their carriers .
The big corporations have established a rewards programs and competitions to promote innovation in the organization .
Organizations know very well that innovation is crucial to continue in the market .
Therefore , the organizations give the best positions to the people with the most innovative way of thinking , and they do not give the most important positions to people who just do what they already know .
It is common to listening in the organizations a general suggestion to the workers : `` Think out the box ''

In conclusion , the new ideas and new developments in the business and even in the societies come from the people who try new things and who take risk .
This kind of people normally get broad rewarded and usually are the most successful people .
