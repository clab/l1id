Many people are worried about the quality of the educational system at schools and high schools .
One of the debats is if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
Firstly , if you learn ideas or concepts you can apply them in more topics and you can understand other issues based in the same principle .
On the other hand , if you learn only facts , you have a little knowledge about a few things or questions .

Learning ideas does not mean only that the teacher tell you something and you believe it by heart .
However , it means that with this idea , you can develop more and apply them in facts .
For instance , if someone teaches you the concepts of the physical mouvement of cars , you may transfer it to facts .
You will be able to put a car in mouvement if you understood the basic principles .

If someone learns only facts , this person will not be able to think by herself because her knowledge and experience is not really wide .
Therefore , I think that learning ideas and concepts may help the person to develop her mind and way of thinking .
However , sometimes people cannot understand the ideas or concepts without examples , so they prefer to learn only practical things .

To summarize , in my opinion is always better to learn ideas or concepts than only facts because it will be more useful for the future career of students .
The students will learn ideas or concepts about one topic but they can extend them to several fields .
Furthermore , they will develop their skills and improve their way of thinking by themselves .
