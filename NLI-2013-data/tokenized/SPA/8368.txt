I fully agree with the statement saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I will base my essay on my personal experience in order to consolidate my position .

As a child , one 's normally forced to learn all the concepts by heart .
This applies to when we learned things such as letters , numbers and colors .
However , this system only works while people are really young because when they grow up , the scenario changes dramatically .

When I began my first Physics course , I was used to learn everything that was written on a paper or a text book .
The problem appeared when I had to solve an exercise asking me to calculate the impact that gravity had on athletes .
I was unable to solve the problem with all the formulas and theories that I had learned the night before .
I was completly blocked .

I realised then , that understanding the ideas could be much better for me than just learning facts .
I forced myself to get the idea from the sources I had and share the information found with my colleagues and teachers .
This ritual or studying method allowed me to have a better picture of the problem and find a better way to solve it .

Since then , I started forgeting about the traditional way of studying but beginning to understand where the main idea was coming from .
This way of learning is now helping me to solve the problems that I normally face when I 'm working .

When my manager asks me to answer one of his questions , he is not waiting for me to repeat everything that I 've learned from the school but for a quick response and solution .
If you do n't know what the main ideas are , you will not be able to interact with other professionals .

Once again , my own experience makes me confirm what I stated at the beginning .
Teachers and professors should take this new way of studying in order to teach their students accordingly .
Whatever they teach today could help their students in a future .
