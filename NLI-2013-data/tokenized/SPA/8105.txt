I strongly agree with this idea .
I really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
If I understand an idea or concept I can really go deeply in a subject and remember it for long time .
Also , I can apply that idea to other situations .
On the other hand , if I just learn facts I will have just superficial knowledge and I will remember those facts for short time .
Probably , it is going to be difficult for me to apply that knowledge to other scenarios .

First , it is very important to deeply understand concepts and to remember them for years .
From my personal experience I can say that I studied literature in high school not only reading the books but also analizing them in their context .
Knowing who the author was , when the book was written , for example .
With that ideas in mind I could understand better what a text said and I can still explain that topic to other people .
On the contrary , I studied biology just with facts .
For instance , I learnt the name of parts of the body and their location , but I never understood how they worked .
If someone asks me about that field , I would have to say that I do not know much and also I do not remember even the facts .

Second , I think that a good way to use the knowledge is applying it in different situations .
To do that we need to understand very well what concepts we know and how they are related with others .
Although we have a big list of facts , we can not use the esence of that subject in a new challenge .
For example , to play the piano I have to learn how to read music .
I can not just learn wich key in my piano is Do , Re or Mi .
I have to understand that the notes are a representation of music and in that way it is going to be possible for me to play any piano , keybord or even othe instruments .

As a conclusion I can say that if a student wants to learn , he or she has to understand the ideas and concepts first .
The facts are also important , but they are nothing if the student can not explain how they are related or if he or she can just repeat words without a deep meaning behind them .
