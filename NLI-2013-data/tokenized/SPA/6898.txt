Since the invention of the modern car , based on the explosion engine , the manufacturing of cars has increased continuosly making possible that any family in the occidental countries could have one .
This is one important succes that the modern society has achieve , making possible a lot of facts than traditionally were n't able to all those families .

Cars make our life really easier .
Since every family could own a car the distances between cities and towns have been reduced and it 's really easier to visit places , go to job faster , carry things , etc .
It 's unimaginable a world without cars .
But in the other hand we have to think how those machines has contributed to the global warming .
The use of petroleum and poluted gases increases the toxic air and afects our world enviroment .
We also have to think about all the wars and global problems that this need of petroleum has created .

Today there are too many cars in the streets .
The life on the cities is turning very dificult because is so common to use a car that there is no space in the cities to allow them .
The air is turning difficult to breath and every day more people are going to live outside the cities because of these polution .
The public transport is n't answering the people 's needs .
They are overcrawded and many times arrives late wherever you go .

I 'm a triatlon sportsman and for me has become really dificult to do any sport in the city .
It 's too dangerous .
I think it would be great that in the future there will be fewer cars .
We all need to be conscient of the importance to maintain a clean enviroment , where the cities become a safe zone where everyone could live , enjoy and do some sport .
