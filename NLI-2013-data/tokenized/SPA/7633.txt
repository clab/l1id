If one intends to be a tourist , it is logical to form part of a group and hire a tour guide .
However , if one wants to be a traveler , a path that I have always chosen when visiting countries , one must be independent .
One must fully experience the culture of a country , go beyond tour guides and give oneself space to explore and savor the aspects of one 's interest .
Groups and tour guides only confine the experience and more often than not leave the tourist disappointed .

A group limits one 's options .
For example , if a person is interested in art more than in shopping , he or she might have to be satisfied with the time given to explore an art museum in a group 's schedule .
On the other hand , if one is not part of a group , one can spend whatever time one wants in an art museum , avoiding what would probably otherwise be a somewhat superficial experience .
A group also often has a budget .
If a person is highly interestd in the gastronomic aspect of a culture , he or she might be willing to spend more money on food quality and variety .
Nevertheless , a group does not provide this flexibility .

Getting a tour guide is often a recipe for disillusionment .
Tour guides have a schedule , and are probably not willing to linger on any specific monument or work of art .
More importantly , it is difficult to truly appreciate a culture without reading or investigating about the country being visited .
Being confident a tour guide will provide all the information may lead travelers to neglect research prior to visiting , often as the result of an overestimation of the tour guide 's knowledge and passion for his or her job .
Lastly , tour guides often lead visitors to the infamous `` tourist traps '' : locations , stores or restaurants often exalted by guides and books that are not worth so much praise in reality .
Without a tour guide , one can avoid such scams and disappointments by doing independent study and choosing which places to visit .

While travelling in a group led by a tour guide is often convenient and less expensive than planning the adventure alone , it takes away value from the actual trip .
I , for one , greatly value independence and enthusiasm when going to a foreign country .
Thus , my option is always counting my family as my group and being my own tour guide .
