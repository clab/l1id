In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject .

People that do not specialize in one specific subject usually have a broad knowledge of manz academic subjects .
The problem with this type of knowledge is that the person usually knows a lot about lots of topics but does n't have a deep understanding of any of them .
For example : during middle school and sometimes high school , students are thought various academic subjects , that is to say that they attain knowledge from all of them .
The problem that they have is that they do have knowledge about many different things .
But since they have to study all of them , they are not really able to completly understand any of them because the brain does n't have the capacity toabsorbe such basts quantities of knowledge .
And as a consequence these students can not use this knowledge in order to make a significant progress in any of these areas .

On the other hand an individual that specializes in one specific subject can have a greater understanding of the subject he/she is studying .
By specializing in one subject the person manages to learn everything there is to know about it and as a consequence he can then use this knowledge to inovate .
For exaple : in medicin there are some diseases that are so complex that the only way in which a man can be capable of understinding its possible causes in oredr to be able to make an attempt to find a cure for it is by specializing , concentrating in that one specific area .
If we think about it , all the advances that the world has made have been becuase of individuals that focuse ( specialize ) in a single area of knowledge and expand it .

There is too much knowledge in the world for a single mind , its physiologically impossible for a single man to be able to learn everything there is to know .
So if he attemps to learn everything he will not only fail to do it , but he would have sacrifice time he could have invested in learning more about an specific subject .
On the other hand I do think that people should have a minimum amount of knowledge of many academic subjects because everything you can possibley learn will help you in the future .
