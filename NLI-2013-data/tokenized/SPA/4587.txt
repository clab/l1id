The influence of marketing in our societies has been enormous in the last few years .
The practice of publicity also has changed dramatically .
From my point of view , companies exaggerate the personalities of their products in an outlandish way .
This is unfair for the consumers who believe in the authenticity of the advertisement and the message that buyers are getting are not true .

First , people most of the time are getting messages through the media that something is really well develop and its quality is not comparable with nothing else .
This is not right as people think that the message send to them is honest , thus they believe whatever they heard .
This is like playing games with the people .

Second , when people face reality , it is when they go to buy an item , then they are realized that what it is offering to them is not what they have shown to them .
Their reality come true as something of very bad quality and the price ask for such item is awkfaully expensive .
People realized that the message was just an scam in order to get their attention and then go to buy that good .

Finally , people who use advertisements this way , they are very dishonest with their buyers .
So , nowadays we have to be very careful about what companies offer us in flayers , newspapers and TV .
It is very easy to get someone attention offering the most wonderful and perfect items in the world , but it is what we are getting .

Overall , people who advertise , they do not regards other people as soon as they will be able to obtain whatever they want .
It is their final purpose , regardless the consequences .
This is a very popular way to get people .
Thus , I agree with the above statement .
