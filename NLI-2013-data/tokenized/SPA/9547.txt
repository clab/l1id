Sucess is an equivalent of taking risks .
Trying new things are an equivalent of being brave and facing new challenges .
I agree that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than staying on their `` comfort zone '' .

A realistic example is my personal experience .
I was born and raised in Puerto Rico .
I completed my highschool and undergraduate college degrees in Puerto Rico .
In my country , most rich young people attend to american schools and this enables them to be fluent in both language , english and spanish .
Even though that I come from a middle high class family and did n't have the luck of attending to an american school .
I learned english watching television and reading english magazines .
In addition that I attended to an intensive english summer program .
In my junior year of college , I decided to apply for an exchange program at New YorK University and never thought that I was going to get accepted .
So it happened , I did n't get accepted for the Spring semester and was devasted .
I felt like a looser .
In the next upcoming fall semester , I decided to apply again and finally got accepted .
Just imagine coming from a very small island and having to compete with other US native studends .
I got very scared but never looked back .
I finished my exchange program with a 3.0 at one the toughest business school in the entire United States .

That is a true example of success .
I decided to try something new and take the risk of moving into a such difficult and fast lane city as New York City .

Even if at the begining things do n't work out the way that you wanted .
Just the fact that you tried that defines success .
Now a days , after all the struggle I am working at an advertising agency as an account executive and have an amazing appartment in one of the most exclusive neighborhood of the city .
Although the path was not easy and pleasant at the end I found success .
