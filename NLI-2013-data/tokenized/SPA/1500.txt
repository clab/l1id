In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This is because a person with a general knowlegde of many subjects is usually more prepared for a lot of things in life than a person that knows perfectly everything about a single subject .

I believe that a person who knows about things like science , math , history and art for example is much more prepared for living in our nowadays society than a person who knows only about cooking lets say .
There can be a man who is the best chef in the world , he can be very succesfull in what he does , but how usefull can it be to know how to make the a wonderful birthday cake when you do n't know how to divide it in exact pieces for everyone ?
or how would he know what food is good or bad for human beings ?
or how would he know how to advertize his food ?
how to manage and create a restaurant ?
These and so many other reasons are why it is important to have at least a little bit of knowledge in many subjects .

Also for personal satisfaction , I think it is important to know about different subjects .
I believe a person always feels better when they know more .
I certainly believe that a someone who knows everything there is to know about a subject , like cooking , also feels pretty good ; but going to back to the chef example , how would he feel if he goes to a dinner with all his friends and they start talking about history or politics or world affairs ?
In my opinion he would rather stay home next time and only meet his friends when they want to eat his wonderful dishes .
I think being ignorant in a lot of things can create a low self-asteem for many people , even if they believe they are the best in ONE single subject .

In conclusion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one because it does n't only help us with our daily lives but it also gives us a personal satisfaction , because we know about more than one thing .
