Well I think that I also thought that at once , but now I realize that young and old people can enjoy the life the same way .

A lot of people think that young people can enjoy the life better because they are more healthier and also they have no problems that make them angry or worried .
Without problems they think they can only think in the pleasures of the life but that 's not true .
For young people there are other kind of problems that for them are really big , but when you get older you realize that those problems was n't that important .
Old people say that is better when you are younger because for example you are not married or have childrens .
With a family you ca n't take a lot of travels or things like that bacause you must stay at home with your children and do things like send them to school work for them and your husband , etc .
Instead when you 're young you do n't have to do any of those things and only think of living your life and enjoy it .

In another hand I think in another big example .
My mom .
Yes my mom get married when she was only eighteen and that year she have my brother and two years later she have me .
She does n't spend time on her and actually she did n't live her youth .
But now that my brother and me are in the university she can redo her live and do things that she always want to .
For example she loves to go out and hang out with her friend and family .
One of the things that she always want to do was go to europe and now she did it .
Well , with this little example I can show other people that older people canenjoy their lives too just like we , young people , do .
