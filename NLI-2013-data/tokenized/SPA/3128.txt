I believe that age does n't matter when it comes to enjoying life , it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeeze every drop they can get .
Sometimes when we are young we tend to think that old people had their time and that because they are so worried on their grandchildren , the cold weather , money problems or about their health problems they do n't enjoy life the way young people do .
We believe that age is everything until that a day comes when you look back and think of the great memories you have and the great ones that will still come .

My grandmother was a great example .
She always used to tell me what her life was like when she was a little girl growing up in a small town and moving to a big city , going out with her firends , her curfew and when my grandpfather proposed .
I thought about how great her life was but never thought about how great her life is .
Since we see the present as something common and even unrelevant sometimes I did n't see my grandmother 's life as '' exciting '' let alone fun when she was 60 .
Now , after many other conversations , I got to know that life goes on and that every day is enjoyable , even if it 's your last .
My grandmother goes away on field trips with her friends while I am studying for a never ending test , cooks because she wants to and not because she HAS to , has great stories to tell and always waits for us with a great meal .

Enjoyable gets a different meaning while you are growing up .
When you 're little an ice cream and your mom is everything .
When you get older a toy or a new friend is very important ; when you 're a teenager enjoying life is having friends around you and have something you can identify with like sports ; by college the challange of living alone , traveling , going out to clubs and having a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoying your youth .
By the time you graduate hopefully you 'll get a good job , marry the man of your dreams and watch your kids grow up .
Every step of the way is enjoyable then .
In my opinion there are no times when you enjoy things more than others , it 's up to you to make every effort for every moment to be worthy and worthwhile .
