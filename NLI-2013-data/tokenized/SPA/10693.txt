I agree in part with the statement , but I do n't think that those are the only two characteristics a successful person has .
In my opinion , those characteristics are strongly associated , if not derived , from self-confidence .
A person that is self-confident is not afraid of trying new things and taking risks .
In a way it has to be a person that knows that whatever happens there is always a way to make things work .

On the other hand , I disagree in part with the statement because there is a good amount of people who have success and not necessarly take risks or try new things , in fact they do what they know well or are especialized in .

Could it be that success is associated sometimes to luck ?
There has been a lot of people , throughout History that they had a good idea , but it was n't the moment and years later it became a reality .

In my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variaty of factors should come together , such as , personality traits , knowledge and the moment or period of time he or she is born .

Success involves a large scope .
A person may be successful in his or her professional life but he or she is a failure in social aspects .
Taking risks and trying new things may be applicable and a desirable characteristic for a person that runs a business , but I strongly disagree that it will be a desirable trait in a relationship .

So , to call a person successful I consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characteristics do n't limit only in taking risks and trying new things .
