The issue in hand is what the best way to travel in group is , with a guide tour or by their own .
I agree that the best way of traveling is having a tour guide , especially when it is a group trip .
There are many reasons why I think this is a better approach , but here I am going to mention three that I consider the most important ones .
You can save time , money , and have the chance to visit more places .
Now , let me tell you more about why I mentioned these three reasons .

The first reason for which I agree that uaing the servicce of a tourist guide is a smart thing to do is because having a guide would saved the group some time .
Because the chances of getting lost in a new place are really high , but if you do n't need to worry about finding directions , then you would be able to visit more places in the same period of time .

Second , having a guided tour would save you and the group some money .
For example , you would save money in gasoline since you wo n't have to drive around trying to find the places you want to visit during your trip , also the car rental fee would be chepaer because the whole gruop could ride in only one car .

Finally , I agree that traveling with guidance is more effective because you be able to see more places , this for sure .
A tourist 's guide is usually a local person , therefore he or she knows pretty well the area , and what is most important to me when I visit a new place , to learn about its history behind .

So , in conclusion I agree with the idea that traveling with a guide is the best way to do it .
