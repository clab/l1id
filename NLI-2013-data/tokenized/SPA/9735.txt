Today there are many people that follow their own ideas and they usually have to take risk in some situations .
But there are other people like to know when they have to do something .

First of all many people like to take their own opinion when they have to do something , I think that is good fo them .
But sometimes when people try to new things in their life they have to take some risks .
For example , My father has a business and when he started in his businees he had to take a lot of risk in the beginner , my father is kind of the person who like to try new things .

In addition , I have many friends that like to try new things and I think when people try to do something new they use their imagination , also they can create new things in order to be successful .

On the other hand , there are people who like to know something in order to do well .
This kind of people is more safe about their life and they are more careful with themselves .
In fact , people who do n't like to take risk , they can live better and they can be successful too .

Moreover , This kind of people like to go at university or college because they prefer to be safe in order to do something well and they never like to take risk in their life .
But the problem with this this way is that you have to spent many years of study .

In conclusion , I 'm agree wih this both ways because I can be a successful person .
And this both ways have positives and negatives things .
Thus , In my opinion If I have to chose one of them I 'll chose to know something in order to do well because I 'll take less risk than the other way .
