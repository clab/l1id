I actually live in Barcelona , a city with a lot of traffic .
I have a car but I usually go everywhere by public transport .
I only use the car to go outside the city .
However , nowdays are a lot of cars everywhere and , in general , we use the car for go everywhere .
Consequently , it 's difficult to imagine a city with fewer cars .

I really think that in a short period of time it will be less cars everywhere .
There are a lot of reasons for think like that .
The first one , is that in some years will be very expensive use the car .
For example , the petroleum resources are finishing and everyday the gas price is increasing .
Another example is that in Barcelona in most of the places we have to pay to park the car .
This reasons make public transport cheaper in comparation with car 's price .

The second reason is that in the big cities is faster go by public transport everywhere than go by car .
We have a very functional and complete underway , with a lot of lines .
It is also very regular , we have one every five or ten minutes .
Moreover , there are a lot of underway stations in the city .
If you use this stations you do n't have to spend time looking for a place to park the car .

On the other hand , the people who live outside the city has a lot of problems for use public transport .
In most of the little cities or towns , the public transport only works one time in an hour or maybe the station is at 30 minutes walking .
If this happens , it 's easier and faster go by car than use a public transport .

In summary , I think that the number of cars will decrease in the big cities , with good public transport , and it will be the same in the litlle cities and towns .
Unless the goverment improve the public transport overthere .
In conclusion I think that it will be fewer cars in the future but it will not happen everywhere .
