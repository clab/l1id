Nowadays , in our countries we have a huge numbers of cars running on the highways , and it seems that something needs to happen to avoid this situation that sometimes becomes problematic .
In any case , I do not complety agree with the question .
Let me explain better , On one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company cars have for the economy .
The motor industry is one of the most important industries in the world .
So , I suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the cars , without affecting other fields , or aspects of the economy .
And maybe it could have impredecible effects .
I am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future .

On the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet .
In this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us .
These cars use gas , or vegetal oil .
We have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains .

In conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question .
Usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view .
I mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling .
I try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment .
I think that the people will create a new kind of car on this goal , for the future .
I hope so .
