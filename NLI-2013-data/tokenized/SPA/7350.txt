Today , there are many way in that we can travel around the world , among others , buy a tour package or prepare own trip .
The first way , in general , includes a trip in group with a tour guide , but in the second option is possible travel alone without tour guide .
Each of this method to travel have a lot advantages that I will describe .

The first point I would like to state is the advantage to travel in a group led by a tour guide can be a fun experience , becouse it is possible know to new people in the trip , moreover , in this kind of trip many friend decide to buy the same tour , and this is good reason to take it .
Other advantage is that the persons that buy the tour are safer , since they are not alone in any place that they are going to visit .
For example , one time I traveled to europe with a friends , we bouth a tour and we could to visit only places that were inside the schedule of tours , obviously all these places were safe for tourists .

By other hand , in spite of the compelling advantages mentionated in the last paraghrap , I think that travel alone without tour guide is the best way to spend time on vacation .
When a person travel alone , he or she can decide what time he will arrive , what place he will visit , where he will sleep and what he will eat , etc .
For instance , last vacation I went to Brasil , I enjoyed a lot my trip , I could move to different hotel according my own decision and no one gave me order about my time .

Overall , there are many factors to consider when we must decide about how we travel , but according to the strong advantages point out on travel alone without tour guide , I think that it is the best way .
The first method to travel have the essential advantage that there is someone that lead the trip and it is safer for people that take it , but the most important advantage the second method is that the person is more free .
