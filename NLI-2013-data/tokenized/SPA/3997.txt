I completely agree with what the statement asserts .
I believe that nowadays students are more and more concerned with their own interests and less preoccupied for their nearby people 's needs .

Students only want to go out with their friends , amuse themselves and have a life without preoccupations and resposabilities .
On my opinion this is caused by a society that is getting more and more selfish and because parents and goverments are permiting it .
We live in world where people want to get their necessities fulfilled and these ones are related more with personal and individual interests than with social interaction .

Personally , I think that people were more united before .
They used to help when it was necessary and they were taught to be attentive and co-operator with everybody .
At the present time , students do n't have these morals or ideals and they do not feel that they must help their communities necessities .
That students nowadays do n't have enough time to carry out this kind of social labours it is not a reason , because students have never had so much time than ever .
The problem is that tudents are getting more and more interested in playing videogames and other activities than helping their communities .

It also depends on the country you live .
What I mean is that for instance , students do n't have the same responsabilities and duties in Germany than in Spain .
Spaniards do n't have to accomplish any social labour like helping handicaps , invalids or aiding in government jobs like Germans do .
I think every government should entice his students to carry out miscellaneous labors by making up to them in any aspect .
What I mean is that if students do n't feel the necessity or they just do n't feel attracted to helping their communities the goverment should impose them a minimum social work requirement .
