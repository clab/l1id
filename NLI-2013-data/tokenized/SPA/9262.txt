It 's equally important for a student to undertand ideas or concepts and facts .
When students are begining with their education , they just learn facts .
For example : that 2 x 3 is 6 or that balloons can float in the air .
However , to achive a better comprehension of that fact , they need to know all the ideas and concepts that are behind it .
They have to learn the idea about , fo example multiplications , to be more efficient doing them and to applicate them in other problems .
About the example of the balloon , when the students , finally know that the principle about densities is the responsible that the balloon to float in the air , they will understand better the phenomenon and similar facts too .

We , the people , create ideas and concepts to explain better all the facts that surrounds us .
A theory or state is assigned when we see a fact .
For example , Galileo formulated the theory about the gravity when he saw that an apple dropped down from a tree and hit his head .

An idea or concept that do n't explain something that we can see in our surrounding is near useless .
For what does we can use a theory that does n't explain any observable and measurable besides nothing ?
But , in the other hand , some ideas have helped us to see facts that we did n't saw before .
For example , the ideas and concepts of the early periodic table of chemistry , suggested the presence of new elements .
This was confirmed with the discover of oxygen , which was n't discovered till several studies of the combustion .

It 's imperative to remember that the students will understand the ideas and concepts when they have the necessary knowledge and the mental abilities .
It 's really difficult trying to teach a kid of 5 years the ideas and concepts that students graduate schools see .
They will understand the ideas when they reach the indicated age .

Finally , not the facts nor the ideas are the most important things that the students have to learn .
To achieve a complete education , they need to learn facts and to understand ideas in the same amount .
