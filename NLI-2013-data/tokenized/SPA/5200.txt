In the modern capitalist life , marketing and image are becoming sort of equivalent things .
The audio-visual media generate and move huge amounts of money , and what is more , in an exponential way .
For example , let 's think in the TV .
On one hand , TV moves loads of money so enterprises want to invert in it the more and more .
On the other hand TV produce and strange decreasing effect on people 's critere and abilities to judge .
So the more and more there is people who just belive in whatever they can see in a TV commercial , and what is more , if your favorite TV star is wearing this amazing product you always wanted to belong , then there is definitely no reason to doubt about the fact you have to buy that product .

Unfortunately , enterprises now that , so they invert in marketing .
For this reason I absolutly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
But , what happen when the consumer realize the trick ?
Well in this case , what happen it is NOTHING .
When consumers realized they have been trapped by the marketing technics , they just keep the product and go to buy another one in the way they thought the first product they bought was .

I think it is untolerable that this kind of things can happen .
The consumer associations apparently do nothing , and when some upset consumer try to denunce the situation it is just like if you talked to a wall .
So in conclusion , from my point of view the goverment should make any intervention and should promote consumer associations to let them be more effective .
On the other hand people should spent time in carrying out activities to develope their judgement skills , for instance reading books and not watching TV .
Unfortunately it seems that it is hard to happen .
In my opinion , not only products seem much better that they really are ; it will be an incresing trend in this fact that will lead to the dicrease of the quality of products the more and more , and will make people spent money more frequently and major amounts of money each time .
