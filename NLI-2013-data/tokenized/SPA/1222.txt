In the world we live in today , education is one of the most valuable assets a person can have .
If we where to be living in the 19th century , it would be better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific thing .
During those ages , specialization was not very important .
It was more important if one had a broad knowledge of many subjects .
One can see that for example , Taylorism , which was basically a new form of working in plants ( it was based in speciallization of workers and a good management so that workers would n't loose time ) , was only taken into account during the first part of the twentieth century with the arrival of the production line invented by Henry Ford .
Before that , people did n't take into account specialization , because there was no need to .
There were no procesess involving specific actions or functions .

Nevertheless , we are not living in the 19th centruy .
We are already in the twenty first , where a carrer is very important .
The more one studies , the more probable is that one will do well in their future .

The world is becoming every day more and more competitive .
Every year , there are millions of people who go into the labour market , and compete between themselves for a better job .
The only way to differentiate a potential good job applicant form a bad , one is the studies they have .
If one applicant has studied a lot , and the other has not , it is more probable that the one who has better studies will get the gob .

Besides that , there is the subject of specialization in specific areas .
Nowadays , firms are demanding very specific kinds of workers .
Workers who have specialized in very specific areas , in which other worker would not be able to perform the task .

This type of demand for specific workers is becoming greater and greater every day .
This is why one would think that , living in the competitive world that we live today , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
