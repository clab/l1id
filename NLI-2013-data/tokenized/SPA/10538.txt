Succesful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I logically agree with this concept and I think that almost all times hope and a good attitud can make much more than knowledge and money , but the convination of the four things is something amaizing .

The most impportant thing to really succed in your life is achieve your golds , that is the reason you should be persistant ; be proud of yourself , never keeping the felling of knowing that you could do something more , or that you could be part of something but you were too affraid to do it .
Do n't be affraid , trust in yourself , the most important , believe in you !

A great example of succed in the life is my sister , Laura Garza , she is the person that I admire the most ; she is the kind of persons that when she propose something , she gets it , no matter what , no matter how much time it gets , no matter how tired she is , no matter how much it costs .
I realized that when Laura wants to do something , she does it , as easy as that , I really got astonished when I knew she will go to study Clinical Phsycology in Washington , and why , just because she wants to do it , and guess what ?
She is studying in there now .

Succes , what is succes ?
Well , the answer is different to all the people , but the real succes in the life is when you feel comfortable with yourself , when you get up in the mornings and feel you really deserve to be where you are , when you look all around you and finally say : After all my work , I finally get it !
But the most important , you should never give up , you should never think , okeay that is enoght ; because , it is never enought .

You could always be learning and doing something .
I asure you that you will get up , and if you have an open mind and a competitive attitude , you will learn something new everyday .
Just never give up and you will rich your golds , and really succed in your life .
