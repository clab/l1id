I think the best way to travel for the first time to an unknown place is to be in a group lead by a tour guide because of their experience , their knowledge about all important turistics sites and how easilly he can move between the cities , places and small villages you are planning to visit and the facility to carry your suitcase all day in the truck with thinking that it may get lost .
It is not the best way for all cases but yes for the first time on a different and far away place .

When I first travel to Europe , I did it with a friend and we went on a group that lasted more than a month .
It was great because we met a lot of friends on the trip , from any ages and nationalities .
We felt secure because we were in good hands just being with honest and reliable people who wake up every morning , take care of our personal stuff and reserved all expositions , destinys and places with previous anticipaction without thinkig if we will get tickets or not .
The leader has a lot of experience in these trips so he will be more informed of the most relevant things of each place .

Also , if we were on a tour if there is alot of people in the trip it will be more easily to obtain discounts for expositions , also you dont need to worry if someone stole your money or if you pay for something that you may never receive or see .

When you are travelling on a bus trip all your luggage will be handed directly by the personal staff and delivered directly to the bedroom you will be in .
If you do that by yourself you may need to carry all your heavy personal stuff and there will be no one who will lend you a hand carrying them all day long .

In conclusion I think it is better to go on a tour specially if it is the first time you have been there and the country or place is quite different as yours .
However if I return to Europe some day to visti the exact same places I did during that month I will be travelling backpacking just visiting the most interesting places for me and just carrying the necessaries things just to make my trip a pleasant one .
