I agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' The advertisements are made for help the sells of the products that they are showing .
The advertisements are made by proffesional people whom has been studying the way to transform a simple like in a necesity .
They have had created ways to produce and reflect the best caracteristics of the products , and of course do not show or let think about something can be wrong or is not really good , for make the people feel a necesity for more products than they need .
For many years the advertisements has been created with specific information , colors , pictures ...
everythig is put and combinated having as a result a machine maker of necesities based on likes , desires and hopes .

The advertisements are showed by many ways , from the most common and popular Television , till the most sofisticate Internet and movil phone .
They have to be around and close to the public that they are made for .
This can be done by schedules .
For example if the product is for babys and kids the advertisements will have place on Television by the time the school time ends every day .
Also they can be in the supermarket in very big spaces , with flourescent color , music , and some times with the characteres from the kids ' favorites cartoons .
By other hand when the product is for the big guy in home , like dad , the advertisements will be showed on weekends or some times during the weekdays late at night .

The advertisements have a good razon for exist , when they make what are they made for .
Some advertisements try to sell , other give infomation or can be asking for help .
You can see some others that may seem like have nothing to do , but this is because they are made for no one of the grups that you can be on , but they still been doing a specific work , look next to you , it may be working with your family members .

There is not way for say that I do n't believe that most of advertisements help products seem much better than they are in real .
This works , and it works good .
