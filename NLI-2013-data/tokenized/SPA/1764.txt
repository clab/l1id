Regarding the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that indicates that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , I would have to disagree .
The main reason : why pick one side of the balance , when - at least in this case - you can choose both ?

I think that the specific knowledge of a subject does not excuse a person of knowing other subjects , even if it is at a small level .
Knowledge always complements our activities and , most importantly , it complements ourselves .
Knowledge makes us more complete individuals and better professionals , no matter what activity , profession or craft we practice .

Imagine if the statement was true ...
If we could only pick one side of the balance it could be inferrered that an Aeronautical Engineer would not be able to sustain a conversation with the Louvre Museum curator , for example .
Do you imagine what they both would be missing ?

Regarding the second part of the statement reffering to `` broad knowledge of many academic subjects '' I disagree based on personal experience .
I 'm a journalist , and in my country there 's a saying that states that journalists have `` an ocean of knowledge ...
only one inch deep '' .
This highly offends me , because it generalizes the idea that a journalist is not able to conduct and actual investigation on a subject ( because of his lack of knowledge depth ) .
On the other hand , I 've seen journalists use this `` statement '' as an excuse for their lack of knowledge and investigative capacities , which offends me even more !

Why not have specific subject knowledge combined with broad knowledge of other subjects ?
For me , this is the perfect choice : It allows me to become a more complete professional and person , and to talk and exchange ideas with a variety of people and professionals , which derives into constant learning of new things .

This would also make the world a much `` social '' place : everybody could satisfactory discuss topics and exchange ideas with lots of different people .
The world would n't be made of `` knowledge ghettos '' ( Engineers Vs .
Artists , Musicians Vs .
Chemists ) .
Could you imagine the isolation ?

So let 's get all the knowledge we can , both broadly and specifically .
When it comes to knowledge , do not choose a side , learn about them all !
