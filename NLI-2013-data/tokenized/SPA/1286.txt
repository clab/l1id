It 's definetly better to have broad knowledge in as most of subjets as it is possible .
There are two main reasons that prove this conclusions .
In the first place , general knowledge allows to undersand the world as a whole , were all is conected .
It 's important to undersand that any action has influence over other things or persons , and the connections of that influences are only discovered with a broad knowledge .
For example , in the business world , to undersand why sales of a product go down , you cant only focus in the price , becouse there may be many other reasons that cause lower sales , for example a macroeconomic enviroment that had changed .
In this case , an exhaustive examination of the costs , or a deep analisys of other products prices would be unnecesary , and a waste of time and money .

Another benefict of the general knowledge is the adaptation .
Broad knowledge prepare us to rapidly adaptate to a changing enviroment .
The much knowledge we have in many subjets , the faster a change to adapt to the new situation can be made .
That 's becouse understanding the whole an accurate diagnostic can be made , and prepare and serch if necessary the specialist to solve particular problems that appear in the adaptation process .
Taking the same example used before , a broad knowledge of the business allow the businessman to notice the change in the environment , and react just in time to adapt the product or the company to the new situation .
A specialist maybe would only detect that sales in certain markets are decreasing , and something must be done , but probaly he wo n't have a clue about what to do .

Therefore , it 's clear that a correct academic preparation must include as much subjects as possible .
