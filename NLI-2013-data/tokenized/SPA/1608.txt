In our actual society , which is currently developing faster and faster everyday , it is necessary to be posted on many new findings in diverse fields of science .
Since every field is getting broader as it goes , one may have to choose between having a general knowledge on several fields , or specializing on a certain matter .
I choose the second option .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good thing , if you can handle it .
In order for that to happen , one would have to study different areas , which would leave less time to know deeply each and everyone of them This would mean that , although having knowledge on many subjects , they would be somewhat shallow .
In contrast , it would give you a large list of subjects to talk about with friends and family .

On the other hand , specializing in one specific subject would lead a person to have a profound understanding of the matter .
It is what everyone expects from proffesionals in many fields .
For instance , no one would like to have a surgery if he knows that the surgeon who is going to procede does not know much about the matter .
You might as well get killed with a gun if that is the case .
This example is suitable for any other field , such as economics , or even music .
In proffesional matters , a person who knows more on a single matter is more apreciatted than one who know too many little things .

To conclude , I would say that both kinds of knowledge are important , but having to choose , I would go for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many subjects , because it is more important when it comes to being a good proffesional , whatever career you choose .
