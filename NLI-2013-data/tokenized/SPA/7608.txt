For me , traveling is always good and pleasant .
Every time I can , I go to as many places I can afford to go .
But if I had to choose , there would be some points to review in order to make a decition .

Sometimes or some places are more likely to be visited alone , with your own itinerary .
You can eat whenever and wherever you want , you can spend as much time as you want in an attraction and you are entirely free to visit all the places you like .

The statements made before may seem a great idea , you are free to decide evertyting ! , but people may exceed the limits of this freedom so the whole trip can result in an unpleasant experience .
When things are not appropriately planed , you may spend a lot of time in only one place and at the end you might skeep some important places that you would 've like to visit .

When traveling in a group with a tour guide you have the whole trip planned and , for example , if you go to europe alone and you get so excited about the eiffel tower that you spend almost two weeks in Paris , when going with a group the time to stay in such a beautiful city is a week , you have already lost a complete week that could 've been great in italy .
That kind of things make the group tours more effective for long trips .

Another advantage of taking a tour is that you will be explaind about all the details of the places you visit .
When you go alone you may not know for example , that in the mayan pyramid in Chichen-Itza you can draw a snake by walking around it .

Personaly , for short trips or trips I do with my boyfriend it 's best to go alone because of the freedom of time I get to have .
But if it is a long trip and I want to visit as many places as I can in a short time , a guided tour would deffinitely be the best option .
