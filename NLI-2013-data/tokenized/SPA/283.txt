The students in the class room learn abaut ideas and concepts but is better for student learn facts , In my opinion is more important for students learn facts for many reasons : First learn facts is important because the students learn doing the things , because is more easy the students make and dont forget he or she did , for example do or paint a apple the students never forget the color and form the fruit .

Second the students need understand ideas and concepts but that is easy forget , for example the Teacher prepare yor team and explain this , and the students if not study or review then he or she forget .
In many cases the students is lazy and arrive the home and forget your books in the room and begin to play them forgot the lesson .

Third is important learn facts because them learn of your own experience .
For example if your theacher it 's theaching abaut the resources naturals is better go out the camping and see trees , animals , rivers etc. theaching the importance them the students do n't forget that experience .

The is necesary for students learn ideas and concepts but is better learn facts because is more easy remember that .
She or He learn doing and do n't forget never that , also learn of your own experience .
