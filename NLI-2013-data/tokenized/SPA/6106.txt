Nowadays the society is concerned about the increase of oil demanding .
One of the most important oil uses is the transportation , including the people tranportation .
The car presence in the next years , the most commun trasnport for people , could change if new technologies are not developed .

Although cars are getting more and more efficient in the oil spending , the truth is that during the next twenty years the costs of oil will increase a lot , so the cars will be fewer .
On the contrary , the development of alternative energy supplies , like hydrogen , or the use of clean thechnologies like solar energy , could stops the decrease of the number of car used .
Besides , these are nowadays very well acepted by the citizies and the sensibility to the enviromental probles thar oil burning probokes is higher and higher .

Another important question to take into account is the increasing development in high velocity trains with could transport people from the neightbourings to the centre of the most populated cities very efficiently .
This , obviously , will decrease the number of car used .
However , as it can be infered from the last train accident in germany , the safety of the speed trains is one of the main worries people .

As a conclusion , if the clean thecnologies are developed and are capacle to supporte the cars demanding in spite of the costs , the number of cars can could increase .
Nevertheless , if the cost are so high that ordinary people cannot stand them , the technology will be focused to the public transportation .
