I disagree with the statement that considers it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
In the following paragraphs , I will attempt to explain my position from different perspectives .

In my opinion , someone who knows `` little about a lot '' , will probably be unfamiliar with the specifics in each of the areas he or she knows `` a little '' about .
The probable outcome is that this person wo n't be able to do anything his own and will need specialists in each area to help him or her .

Instead , if that person were to specialize in at least one area , then people can go to the person for help on a specific matter .
The person can , in turn , ask for help or advice in areas beyond his or her expertise .
From an economic perspective , I think that this optimizes resources .
From a social perspective , I think that this creates social interaction , since people will continue to need from each other .
It also prevents mistakes .
Why ?
Because many mistakes are made by those who think they know .

Finally , I think that the future is tending to a world of more specialists .
In day to day life , we see that universities offer very specific courses .
On the other hand , we see that companies are demanding precisely that .
It is no longer sufficient to be a lawyer , or a tax lawyer - for example - since some companies are looking for a specialist in transfer pricing , which is a very specific part of tax law .

To summarize my opinion , I think that from an economic and social perspective and for other reasons described above , it is better to be an expert in a field than to know `` a little about a lot '' .
