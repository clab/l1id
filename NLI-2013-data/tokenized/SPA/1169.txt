There are several good reasons why I believe that is better for students to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
First of all , I think that nowadays , work problems are very difficult to resolve and involve a lot of skills like computers knowledge or to know a different language .
Currently , companies need people to overcome this sort of integrated problems , and the person has to have a broad knowledge .

Secondly , if students have more skills or abilities , they will have more likelihood to find a job .
Therefore , if they become borried in their work , they can apply to others job because people with a broader knowledge can do more things than the others .

Although it is true that some people say that companies pay more to people who know how to resolve a specific task , I think that is better for a person earn less money but with a lot of likelihood to get a job , than a person who can earn a lot of money , but working in a only one type of job .
World market today are very difficult , people are hired currently and consecuently they have to look for a job more than ever , for this reason I believe that is better for a person to has a broad knowledge .

I can support my opinion with a personal experience that I lived five years ago .
I was working in CNN as a journalist , and suddenly I heard that the Company Board needed someone to work in trade area .
After a brief hiring process , I got the position only because I had studied a finance course in university .

In my opinion , I think that have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects is better than specialize in one specific one , because a person have more posibilities to get a job , to resolve better the work problems and thirdly , because encourage his knoledge .
