I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people because I think that young people do not have neither the experience nor the knowladge to appreciate the gift of the live in its complete dimension .
By the other hand , older people have the experience and knowladge that allow them to enjoy the most important things in the life .

In first place , I believe that we have to learn what is life and what is its purpouse , in order to learn how to enjoy it .
For example , I can notice that my two years old son enjoy to play with the piano but he does not know how to play the piano .
In that order of ideas , life is like a piano , you need to learn how to live to appreciate it in all his dimenssions instead of only merely living because you have born .
For example , older people frecuently have the wisdom to appreciate their family which they consider the mos important in their life , but young people try to live appart of his family as soon as possible

In second place , each fase of the life has its own time , if young people could understand what is really important in life they could work to achieve those goals , like to study to get a good job that allow them to rear a family , instead of only trying to pass the life as if it where a big and eternal party , and when the get older they realize that have lost his opportunities to be really happy .

In third place , some young people go to fast in life that they cut their opportunities to enjoy his life in its own pace .
Nowadays they want to grew older to experience new emotions , like drinking alcohol , smoking , having sex or using drugs , somtimes influenced by the media or by their mates , they do not have the capability to say no to some dangerous practices .
But older people know better what is good or bad for enjoing the life and how avoid dangerous practices .

In conclussion , to learn how to enjoy life is the reason because we have teachers or masters .
Young people need to learn to live and to be prepared for the chalenges that living in nowadays have .
In other words , young peole need to appreciate and enjoy life in all its dimenssions , and older people are called to teach their wisdom to the new generations to enjoy life .
