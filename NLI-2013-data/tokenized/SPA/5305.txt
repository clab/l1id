Marketing is the main factor to make this a rule .
I personaly think that products have to look better in the images because the market competition you can found in the real world .

I have found many times my self with a product that is not event the half of good that I was expecting and this is the result of advertising .
Under controled cirumstances the color , the texture even the results of the product are controled by advertisers whom are responsables for the introduction of the product to the market .
And you belive it .

Some times products realy are what they announce and I think these are the expensive ones , not all the time but frecuently the more you pay the more you receive .
Some brands give us the idea of quality and we buy that because quality is important .

I do n't mean with this that we have to pay extra money in order to get better items , some times a particular brand have `` more name '' than others and this the only reason that justifyes this product to be more expesive but not because is the better .

We can find in the market a lot of different brands and quality equipment that can let us solve our needing .
It is in more of the cases the power of adquisition ( the amount of money ) we have the one that rules our buying behaivor .
You have more money , you can buy more expensive things , but not nessesarily the best .

It is a game that we play very often considering all the time the expese versus the quality , some times we just buy an item that bearly gives solution to our need but we are not willing to expend more money on it .

So it is importat to put in a balance what we are looking for and try not to be catched by the ilussion of advertisements because most of the time they are more atractive that thery realy are .
