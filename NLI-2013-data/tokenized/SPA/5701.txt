The advertisement world is a big and unexplore think wich the humans of this time have to live .
I am a comunications expert and it is a shame to accept that most advertisementes make products seem better than they really are .
It is a true .

But why I agree with the statement ?
There is a simple reason : The most important thing in the advertisement world is to persuade people to buy anything , in a lot of cases , things that probably people never is going to use .
There are two posiblly reasons that makes that the advertisement people do this .
One is the money and the other aspect is the people 's ignorance .

The money is the first reason that makes to do this .
In a world when only the most powerfull survive , the money is the best way to get the things .
It means , that if you have money , you have power .
And it is what the bussiness men and the companies want : power .

Then , if they have succesfull with their products , they are going to have money and consecuently power .

For that reason is that the advertisements make productos seem so much better than they really are .
The money , and the obsession for money get that the companies and the advertisement people do not take care about the quallity of the products .
It is like `` if that did not work , it is better for us .
Now you are obligated to buy again our product '' .

The second reason why most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is the people ignorance .
For example , if you see the new product to lose fat on TV , probably you want to have this at home and in the 95 percent of the time this product is not going to help you .
But the adverstisemente tell you that you need drink or eat this for five years or something like that .
Then , the problem is that if the people does not enouhg information and keep in the ingnorance , they are going to buy the product during five years .

But , why do you think that one simple capsule or one simple tea is going to help you to lose fat ?
Do you think that is simple ?
No , it is no simple .
This is a large proccess that need so much time and work .
But the advertisemente tell us that it is not necesaty , and we believe they .

As a conclution , I think that this problem , this lie that the advertisement people give us , should have regulated by the Goberment of each country .
Why ?
Because it is not possible that they , for money , power and ignorance , give us a lie , a false product .
