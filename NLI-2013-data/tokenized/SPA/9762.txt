I strongly believe that successful people tries new things rather than staying on what they usually do .
They explore new chances that opens them even more chances .
They stray from the known path to find out if there are better paths or not .
And they reach success because they have experimented more .

They explore new chances and find out even more chances .
This happens because they are willing to find out more .
Instead of being satisfied with what they already know , they go to the unknown to see what they can learn .
And this risk of going into the unknow opens them new choices and let them expand in their enterprises .

They stray from the known path to find out if there are better paths or not .
They wonder always why are they doing the things the way they do them , and if this way can be improved .
With this , they risk losing valuable resources , such as time and effort , but the gain is even higher in their souls : it is the gain of knowledge through experience .
They run risks at this experiences , and if they lost , they at least did not lose the lesson .

It is precisely this gain of experience that makes them successful .
Thanks to this experiences , they have a better range of perspectives on everything .
This allows them to be better at finding solutions to their problems and to be better prepared for problems they have already faced while they were gaining this experiences .

Successful people run risks for a reason : to gather experiences and knowledge to better their lives .
The more risks they run , the more experiences they will have and the richer their perspective will get on about everything they do .
After all , to be successful you will have to run the risk of not getting to it on time
