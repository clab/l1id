I think it depends how you want to travel and where are you going ? .

When I go with my family I prefer to travel without having a tour guide .
And also if I want to see some specific places or visit some friends .
Because when you go with a group which are ledding by a tour guide , you have to do what the guide says , and you have to go where the guide goes .
And sometimes I prefer to do what I want at the time that I want .

Usually this kind of traveling [ by a tour guide ] it can be a little bit boring , even more if you do not understand what does the guide is saying .
And also it could be tired .
For example there is a schedule in this kind of trips .
You have to wake up early in the morning otherwise the guide and the group will leave and they wo n't wait for you .
And then you have to do what it says in the ittinerary .

Of course if you want to know different places , for example Europe and you go with a group with people in your age , I think it could be really funny and great .
Because at the time you are knowing new places , knowing about different cultures , you are making new friends .
And in this case you do not waist so much time looking for the places or asking where to find what you are looking for .

Also in this kind of trips you know more places in less time .
Because they already know the important places and the routs that we should take .
I agree , fortunately I did this way to travel twice and I will do it again if I have the oportunity .
Any way of traveling is good , of course if it is for fun or culture .
