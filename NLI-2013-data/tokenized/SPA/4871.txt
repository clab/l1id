There are many products that seem to be too good to be true and I believe the influence of advertisements to create this image does not use the right or ethic procedure to achieve this goal .
For this reason I agree with the statement presented in this question .

As a Tourism Manager I know perfectly this situation by studing the case of Touristic Destinations ' plans of marketing .
In one hand , they usually offer an exotic and pristine place that invites you to go there and make use of this facilities : well-equipped resorts , horseback riding for lonely beaches and hiking in magical mountains , on the other hand , these plans omits crowdy beaches during high seasons , hotel rooms that do not have ocean views and so on .
We could mention thousands of examples of this situation .
For me this should be ruled more rigidly and lead to protect in a better way to consumers who are cheated for this advertisers .

In this virtual world where information goes faster and faster by internet , the idea of advertising is becoming sample , cheap and less ruled .
It is easy to see web sites showing marvelous hotels and resorts pictures and with just one click make a reservation that costs hundreds of dollars .
When we get there the reality is so far away we realize that the hotel is not in the location shown or at least does not have the features presented , we understand the picture did not show how many ads and signal everywhere it was possible to see , making our enjoyable destination as polluted as a capital city and making our frustation the most unforgettable of our vacations .
This is a typical case of making products seem much better than they really are .
As an example let 's take Ocean City Maryland in The United States , whoever going to the different websites offering this touristic destination can see the Atlantic Ocean as the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reservation and finally get there , nobody told us about the vehicular congestion , visual pollution and the noise made for teenagers running their cars overspeed .
But that is , and there we are being part of a fraud as many other products that seem to be much better than they really are .
