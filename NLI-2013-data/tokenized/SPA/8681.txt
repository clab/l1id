People can learn through different methods .
Some have an easiness for remembering charts , pictures or other graphics while others learn faster by literal means .
The quality of the retention of those facts varies according to the way they retain them .

When a student understands the idea of what he is doing , he can implement observations of his own .
When one understands something , it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the details .
He may even add new ideas .
Once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyze it , judge it and compare it to former experiences .
Understanding a concept makes it last much longer in the memory .
We have a limited memorization time and space .
For example , if you memorize your credit card number , you will remember it for a period of time .
Once you stop using that number , the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few months .
Our memory works best when we put to practice concepts and understand their functions and structures .

On the other hand , simply learning facts leads to being able to hold back more details .
You may know everything there is to know about a certain theme , but if you cannot understand it , you cannot change it or handle it .
Think of it this way .
Pretend you make a new friend .
You may have read about this person before .
You may know everything about him , from his blood type , to his hobbies , to his tastes , even his habits .
If you do not understand the person , you cannot deal with him , or even maintain a lasting friendship .
To truly know that person you must not only know about him , but also know him .

To conclude , my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain facts .
When you understand , you have the ability to change it , experiment it and even handle it .
If the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime , the best way of remembering facts is to understand them .
