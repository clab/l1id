The given statement is true and relevant for the use in life .
It is agreed that if there are no risks in life , and that new things are not trried , it would be a cotidian and common world where nothing new could be seen .
It would be like a mechanism , like a machine type of work .
You were designeds to do something every day , and that is what you have to do every day in life , like a computer .
It is designed to be used for work activites and in some cases for entreteinment , but there will be nothing new in a computer if there is not a creation of a new invetion or idea for the progress of that computer .

Off cource that there will be risks .
If the product is not accepted by society , then it will be a loss of product and a loss of money , but that is a risk that must be taken in order to make a company grow .
If people are closed minded and does not agree with many new things than the society we live on will not be in any way successful .
It would be a conformist society that just want the necesary things .
It would in part also a sellfish society , where the people will ony worry for themselves and would just ignore the problems that the rest of the society , and even the world has .
Which in a way , is not correct .

There should be an improval in all the things , as history has shown us .
Time has shown that if there is no growth then we would still be in the prehistoric era , where the people could n't even knew how to talk or how to exand their own ideas .
But we have seen that some humans take the risks , and are also shown as an example of the growth in society , and the exceptional work that humans can do .
Because of their risks we have seen an evolution in human days and life , if there was not a risk , then not even technology could have started .
Industrialisation , technology , and many other things that complenent the socienty we live on , are the causes and the effects that were reached by the successful on the risking of society .

For exapmle , if an Alber Einstein would n't exsist , or a Leonardo Davinchi , what might have been of science and religion , and literature .
What about Aristotle , the founder of `` University '' , if it would n't have been for these men , we would n't have any education .
They risked their own lives on trying to make humans life better in knowledge , and in the capacity of learning new things .
They gave away a great amount of time where they could have engoyed with their family , and even , they could have done something common .
But in the matter of fact , they chosed to analyze things deeper , and show society that life can be better , and that there will always be risks to take , but it will be on your hands to take them or not .
It will be your desition to change your life and differ from the common way of life .
