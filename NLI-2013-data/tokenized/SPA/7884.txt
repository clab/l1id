In my opinion and in my own experice , I have treveled with my parents since I was a child , and normally we book the hotel and the rest of the trip is invent it , I mean we decide where to go and how much time spend in each place , We do not have to depend on any guide .

If you want to travel in Eruope for example and you have only one month , sometimes is better to have a guide becouse he know 's the best places that you can visit , but the problem is that he going to tell you when you have to eat , when you have to rest and even worst when you have to wake up .

When I went to work in Bangladesh , I did an internship there , anyway , When I finished my job , I started to travel in Myanmar and then in the North of India , I bougth a guide book , called lonly planet , with that book I knew which places I could visit , where can you eat , sleep and even better how much money you have to pay .
I liked to travel by myself becouse you can learn more about the culture of each place and sometimes you can take part of it .

When I arrived to Bangladesh I never thoung that I was to find a girlfriend there , I did not try to meet a muslime girlfried , I met a girl from Switzerland and actually she is my girlfriend , this kind of experience I think is more difficult to live it if you travel in a group .

For example in Myanmar I met one local person and when I saw him again , He invited me at his wedding , this aspects are the best of the trip becouse you never think that is going to happed .
Another good thing if you travel by yourself is that you going to meet new friends and you can join them in their trip .
I do not say that in a group you are not goin to meet people , of course you will .

My advise is : if you are young and you can travel like a backpacker , do it , becouse when you are old and you can not walk long distaces , I think is better to pay a tour guide , becouse you do not have to worry about anything only you have to wake up early .
You going to remeber more if you face some problems during your trip becouse you have to handle it .
