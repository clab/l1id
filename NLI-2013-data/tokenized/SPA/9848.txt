Definitly , people who is successful take their life in continuos challenge .
Sometimes , someone ask why he / or she can get everything that he/or she wants and I ca n't .
In my opinion , the answer is very simple .
It is neccessary work very hard for get my goals .
People successful have three esential characteristics that the frustrated people not .
The first is take risk all the time , second they are confident in themself and the last they are positive .

First , people successful said yes for almost everything to do ! .
For example , I was working in a project in the laboratory of pathology , but a partner to my field inviting to work in a different project .
I worked with him without though in the inconvenients to result .
when I accepted , I meant to studied harder and long hours to compensate my deficiencies in something new .
However , I did and we finished the project and published it .

Secondly , usually these people are confident in themself .
They do n't feel scare to begin something .
In fact , they always are in continuing challenge and never think in fail .
They know very well their limits and capabilities .
In addition , these charachteristic let them to work in best advantages than the rest of people .
For instance , I followed the trayectory to famous basketball player .
He knew his capability and deffects better than anyone , so he worked specifically in his deffects until he improved .
As result , he was the best basketball player to the year .
This point is relevant for being successful , if I know my limitations .
I need to work harder all the time with it .

Third , being positive is giving to me an excellent capacity to learning useful things for my goals .
In other words , I can get fails , but I take it , such experience for try again .
In short , I agree with the statement people successful have to be confident , positive and be anger to take risk always .
