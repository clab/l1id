Wheather in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than are today is a controversial matter .
It has cost and benefits .
In my own opinion I think that it will not ocur in the next twenty years .

On the one hand , there is evidently that the poblation of the earth will increase in the next years .
If now there are six thousend million of people wich most of them no have car , and knowing that the countries not develop are developing now ( like China , Brazil or India ) or will develop in the next ten years , the people of these countries will buy cars .
In addittion , the developing countries there are two cars per family in now days , with the emigration the number of families are raising , so more cars .
And I want to add that the tecnology is there to make the cars more confortable and with more security .

On the other hand , cars pollute the enviorement and people are now more conciounsly in protect the Earth and the ozone .
This could be affect in the market of the cars in the world because people is using and will use more and more public transport in order to protect the Earth .
Also is important that the natural resources are been used in more cuantity for all the products ( plastic , fuel , natural gas , etc ) and the cars need combustible to work and now the natural resources are growing in use .

To sum up , there are important the two ways .
There are people in the two options and I are in the the option taht in the future
