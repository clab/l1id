Perception is reality .
This sentence is the premise that makes marketing one of the most profitable industries on our days .
As we live in a world in which the media controls millions and millions of minds , the more you are advertised the more you can influence the conduct of the market .

In the early 1990's , parallel to the boom of mass media , the introduction of the internet and the satellite TV companies around the world started to spend constantly more and more money on marketing .
Examples of how people 's mind can be controlled can be shown in almost all areas of production , from medicine to food industry , from clothing to transportation .

I am a medical doctor involved in the cosmetic industry .
Years ago , surgical procedures such as liposuction or breast augmentation were only reserved to a very limited section of the population .
This procedures involve several risks such as general anesthesia , prolongued recovery times , allergic reactions and even stroke or death .
As these procedures started to being advertise in TV shows broadcasted all around the world , such as Dr. 90210 or Extreme Make Over , the number of patients demanding these type of procedures rised globally in a geometrical or even exponential way .
Paradoxically , the risk factors continue to be the same , but as the procedures are more and more advertised , people often belive that the risks have been diminished .

Same situation happens with food .
Aspartame is the chemical component of Nutrasweet , an artificial sweetener that has modified the whole food industry .
Several medical studies were conducted years ago evaluating the safety of the high consumption of Aspartame ; the results were shocking .
Rats exposed to this chemical compound suffered from Alzheimer disease and several types of tumors ; however , marketing is so powerful that it could overcome the negative campaign .

Other examples can be offered and added to the list , but certainly they follow the same pattern .
Our mind is driven by certain impulses that we ca n't control , and the more times we get stimulated by something the more we get involved .
Sad , but this is how it works .
