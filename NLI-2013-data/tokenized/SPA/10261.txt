I agree with this statement .
Today 's life it so annoying and stressing , we must give some changes to our daily rutine , we ca n't be of only thought , today we live on a multicultural world in wich we must rescue something of each culture .
With this statement i do not mean to be a musulman or a catholic , but I mean to respect diversity .

We live for our work , for our job and our bussiness , I belive it 's alright to test new things , new feelings , and maybe be happy with them .
I 'll use myself for this example .
I am a studen of Odonthology in a recognized university in Chile , my mission is to fulfill what my parents and me want , this is ...
finishing my career as soon as possible .
It 's my goal too , but to my goal I add many more activities .
For example I like sports , I love sports , I 'm a basketballer , and a soccer player too , besides tracking running in school .

I know I passed to another part okf my life but I wo n't give up sports on me .
It 's an emotion that fills me when i 'm on the court , specially on the zone .
I just love it .

I think I am a sucsessful man .
Risks perssue me , because I have few time to study , my University is quite difficult , and sports for me now ...
could be a bad choice .

The big problem , or the great disscusion is that I love sports , and i 'm not able to leave them apart from my life .
And this essay 's awnser is quite simple , I belive we have to fight for the things we want , that sometimes we have to be ambicious and work as twice as we are doing now , because 10 years later I do n't want to regret that I took the wrong desition .
I 'm not willing to make that error , I 'm choosing both my career and my passion , sports .
