People always have liked to travel , but there are two principal ways to do that , travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel alone .
Both ways have advantages and disadvantages .

When people travel in a group , they have to follow all the instructions of the tour guide .
They have to start and finish the experience at the same hour , and if somebody does not like the rule , he can not do anything for achieve his wish .
There is no freedom .
For example , in the Rome 's tour , there is not time to visit all the places in the city , the tour only visits the Coliseum and The Vatican .

However , if you like the speech from the tour guide , you can enjoy the experience a lot , because you do not have to look for the interesting sites and its history or its data , the tour guide provides it them to you .
This way to travel is so easy and comfortable .

Altough many people prefer the way to travel alone , because they do not have to follow another group .
They decide all that they will do by themselves .

They use a map , a tourists book or the advices of some friends .
They visit all the places that they want and stay there one day or one year .
In this way to travel you can spent your time or your money in your deepest wishes , your doubts about some places and cultures or attending your necessities .

In my opinion , I think that it is the best way to travel , because I have the freedom to chose what site I will visit , what food I will eat , what time I will spent and at what hour I will wake up and I will start my experience .
For example , I want to visit Quintana Roo but the group led by a tour guide probably visit Cancun in the morning not either Tulum in the midnight .
