what is the purpose of advertising ?
selling .
can you sell a bad looking product ?
definately not .
to sell , you need to make your product look good or even beter than it really is .
that my friends , is exactly what advertising does .

if you show bad quality , you 'll be broke .
juan perez just opened a burger restaurant .
to promote his restaurant , he makes t.v. advertising , on which he shows he 's burgers .
the burgers are totally nutritive , but their their look makes people think they are disgusting .
evem though the burgers are very rich en vitamins and proteins , nobody buys them .
finally , juan goes to bankruptcy on his restaurant .
but do n't worry , this case happens in very few advertisings .

it 's all about the look .
companies such as mac donald 's , burger king and wendy 's , which sell the same type of products juan did , worry more on the way burgers look rather than the way they really are .
for example : it is proven that the big mac has an excessive amount of fat and it is very detrimental for men 's health , nevertheless , when someone watches the tv commercial on which the big mac appears , the first thing that comes to his orher mind is `` that burger looks good ! ''
.
the way the big mac is shown has a huge difference with the way it is in reality .
this strategy is done by almost every advertising company in every part of the market , not only food .

it is completely obvious that products are need to be shown in an `` almost perfect '' . almost every advertsing companies do this because of one single reason : if they do n't , they do not exist .
this means that they will suffer juan 's problem .
the principle of advertising is exposing the best part of the product .
and if ther is n't , well invent it !
