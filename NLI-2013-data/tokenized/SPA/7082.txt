Historically the growth on the numbers of cars has been keept increasing constantly since the third decade of the previous century .
There are no signs of any reversal on this patern , and moreover recent research shows that the situation could be worst on the next years .

First , as the world develops , more families are able to get a car , nowdays the cars are not only for rich and welth people , reduction on the final costs , for average cars ( luxury cars are keep apart of this analysis ) , and the improvement on the world average salary , probably helps to narrow the original economical divide .

Countries under develpment , are a huge potential market for new cars , as the economies of this contries get develop , the life quality of the population grows , also their expectations and their posibilities to get new cars .

Other people migth say , that fuel costs , pollution regulations , and the limited parking space on big cities could stop the sales , and begin with a reduction on the total number of available cars .
Against this people I could only ilustrate that the costs on fuel are comparatively lower today if we compare the fuel with many other products .
The regulations to decrease pollutions are adopted by each individual countries , and also the new cars are complaint about most of this regulations .
The other aspect about parking spaces , could be mitigated with the reduction of car sizes or the develop of new parking technologies .

Personally , I do belive that in twenty years this number of used cars will be much more that there are today , maybe is not the best for us , maybe it is .
However based the actual rate of growth of the number of cars , and the amazing development of the world , especialy on the underdevelop countries , it is easy to predict a grow .
