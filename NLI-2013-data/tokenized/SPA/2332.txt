Young people enjoy life more that older people do ?

To answer this queistion is importnat to take two points of view , the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life , and then answer why old people enjoy life , and finally i will see who enjoy more life , young or older people .

I think that younger people enjoy life , becouse they are in an age that everything is knew , they are exploring the world , they are dreaming , they are building their goal , is wonderfull moment of life .
Is when people started to grow up , and during this process they understan and respond many questions that only living can answer , is a stage when you can make a mistake , and is ok becouse you are learning , no one is going tu judge you , is part of learrning .
I think that i am in a great moment of my like , I feel and I am young , and if i take my own experience i can said that i realy enjoy my life , i had dificulties in my life but was just part of it , sometimes you need to felt and then satnd up and go on , thats life .

By the other hand , i think that older people also enjoy life , because no matter the age that you have you wll always learnig , and in this point of your life you have more experience , so you dont have to worried about if you are going to make a mistake , becouse you know that if you make it everything will be ok .
For example my grand ma she was and old lady , but she always enjoy life like she was a kid , she never felt old , she always was with energy , she wanted to do all the things that she didn , t do when se was a child so she enjoy every minute of her like .

Know she is death , but she teach that life in only one and you have to enjoy it , no matter your age .
The answer of the question about who enjoy more life , is both : joung and older people .
Joung because you are exploring the world and old becouse you are enjoing all what you have explore .
