One may travel for a variety of different reasons , leisure , work or education , and may do so led by someone or planing the activity oneself .
Although traveling in groups lead by a tour guide is an option I do not believe it is the best way to do so , primarily because it caters to the needs of a group not to the individual .
This leads to loss of opportunities , time and overall enjoyment of the activity .

Take for example , taking a lifelong dreamed tour of Europe lead by a tour conductor .
First of all one is stuck to a scheduled list of activities that someone thought would be interesting .
If in a particular city you want to visit an unscheduled historical site you will probably not be able to do so , therefore lossing the once in a lifetime opportunity to view something you really wanted to .
You could of course skip the tour day , but what would be the purpose of taking the tour in the first place .

Since there the mentioned and dreaded schedule , if someone is late for any activity , and someone usually is , we loose more valuable time .
Not to mention patience , influecing our state of mind throughout the day and possibly the rest of the tour .

These are probably very individualistic points of views .
And I defenitelly do think there are benefits of traveling in group led by a tour guide .
But for my personal needs I would rather to plan my own travel .
