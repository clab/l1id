Man have travelled for as long as he has lived in society .
The characteristic of most of today 's travelling is that it is motivated not by economic or political necessity , but by pleasure .
Leisure and this search for pleasure is at the root of the tourism industry .
Understanding the sources of this pleasure provides a solid base to comprehend the best ways to travel .

Where is a person 's pleasure in travelling rooted ?
I believe in curiosity : in being exposed to new situations , enjoying beautiful scenery , getting to know different ways of living , and being a part of other customs and cultures .
It is important to note that the satisfaction of this curiosity is greater when it emerges from personal discoveries .
The best way to travel is , hence , the one which favors and maximizes the satisfaction of curiosity in these two dimensions .

Travelling can be led by a tour guide , or simply alone - in group or individually .
In order to decide which is best , one must ponder the new things one would like to see and learn , on one part , and the possibility of discovering these individually , on the other .
Unfortunately , frequently these do not imply each other , meaning that waiting to discover the marvels of the places a person travels to generally takes time and energy , limiting the places and important things one visits and sees .
The choice of travelling with a guide permits maximizing the experiences , knowledge and sightseeing , but generally minimizes the possibility of discovering these individually .

Considering these , I prefer travelling with a tour book that introduces me on the most important sightseeing and culture enrichening experiences , but does not hinder the possibilities of running off track for some time and discover new things personally .
This is the way I travelled Central America last summer , and it was certainly a gratifying experience .
I have also travelled led by a tour guide - to Cuzco and Macchu Picchu , Peru - and although it was a great experience , being able to discover things by yourself as you travel is truly rewarding .
I have also travelled alone , to Bolivia , but at many times I felt I did not know where to go .

Travelling with a book , instead of a tour guide - in group or individually - seems to maximize the often antithetic sources of pleasure in travel : exposure to new surprising experiences and scenery and the satisfaction of personal discoveries .
