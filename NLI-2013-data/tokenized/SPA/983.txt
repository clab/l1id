For the last decades society has been suffering the opposite way of `` humanities '' conducts that were lived specifically in the 16th and 17th centuries , where people cared for others , for humanity , that 's why was created the `` Humanism '' .
The actual problem is the specialization of subjects that cut off the human relationships .
Instead of care by the person who lives close to us , we care more to know the reason of the molecular existance , for example .
What I want to say is that in the way we obtain more broad knowledge of academic and cultural subjects , we could be better persons in society because we 'll understand those who are the same as us and we also be capable to understand the problems we have as society .
It is part of an open-minded education that the study of a specific subject could n't bring .
To preserve peaceful relationships between different cultures , nations and between different personalities , as society we should perform educational curriculums that waranty a broad knowledge education .
