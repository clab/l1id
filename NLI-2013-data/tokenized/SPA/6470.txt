There are many reasons to think that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .
But this statement is probably too optimistic .
Many things must be taken in consideration to know if this statement is realistic .

One important reason for the idea that it will be less cars in the future is that ecology is taking more and more place is our lives , this will make the consumers drive less or use public transportation .
Maybe instead of having two cars families will only have one .

These changes in our behaviours are caused also by the policies of the gouverments .
They will tend to create laws that will protect the environment .
Their goal will be to lower the use of cars increasing taxes ( London 's dool ) , promoting a more efficient public transportation or limitating the places were cars can go ( an example will be to forbid cars in some streets down town ) .

The problem of the statement is that it maybe only refers to occidental countries ( Europe and North America ) .
Actually China and India are growing very fast .
This will mean that globaly it will be more cars in the future .
Development will mean that all the people that could not buy a car will now be able to do it .
And China and India are two very big markets .
In North America and Europe the economy cannot grow so fast , car consumption will not grow that much .

Another raison why it will not be less cars in the future is that even if a lot of money is used in the public transports the structure of the communications will not change in twenty years .
Our countries are built around the car , we will need more than twenty years to change that and cars at actually the only option in most of the cases ( an example can be the person that lives in the suburbs : if he does not have a good option to replace his car he will not do it ) .

As we can see the objective is to reduce the number of cars .
The problem is that cars are everywhere and twenty years will not be enough to really observe that there are less cars .
Maybe the number will just be the same as now .
