I completely agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .

First , to succed you need to take risks .
Probably everyone that has succeded in their lives has taken risks .
And when you take a risk it does n't mean that you are going to succed for sure .

When you are going to start a new proyect , when you are going to start running your own buisness or if you are going to take a posdoctoral education for example you are usually entering into an unknown field , in a place wihich you are not familiarized with and where you are going to make probably many mistakes and failing exams .
But that is the only way to succed , trying , making mistakes , and the most important thing , learning from them .

By the contrary , of course you can just do what you already know and do n't want to go further in your knowledgent or education .
There is nothing wrong with that point , but your life and knowledgent are going to be limited only in what you know .
You are not even going to be a specialist in what you think you are good at , because to be a specialist you need to study more , take new exams and take new risks .

Nowdays we live in a very competitive world where you need to know everyday something new and you need to be updating your knowlegment , taking continuing education courses etc .
Probably if you are going to look for a new job the most qualified candidate is the one that is going to be chosen .
The same happens with students : we need to further our education in order to be more competitive to be accepted for example in a college .
And the only way to do that is taking risks everyday .
For studying purposes , we need sometime to retake an exam in order to have a competitive score since all students are very qualified .

In conclussion , taking risks will allow us to be more competent , qualified and succesfull in our lives
