Alone , the Best Way to travel it

I disagree with the statament that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I consider that it is better to travel alone .

I believe that when people travel in groups , they have to be accountable to the group .
This can be very stressful and could affect the way they enjoy their vacations or trip .
For instanse , if anything happen to any person of the group , the other people have to wait or spend time assisting this person .
In the contrary , I believe that when we travel alone we are able to develop our own schedule and to enjoy more freely without any interferance from any other person .
This will have a possitive impact in our vacation or trip that it was ultimately taken in order to relax and enjoy as much as possible .
Also , we will spend the time in the best manner without wasting time .

Moreover , when we travel in a group with a tour guide , we are not able to decide our trip 's plan , but we have to relay on the guide for any step to take during the trip .
In the oppositive , if we travel alone we know that we can make any decision regarding our trip 's plan or to decide the lenght of our stay or visit depending on our own circunstances , which defenitevely is more suitable and appropriate for me .
The goal is to enjoy the trip .

Also , travelling alone seems to be less expensive that travelling with a tour guide .
The fact that we have to hire a guide will increase the cost of the trip .

Furthermore , I believe that if travel alone , we will have more time to see the thing that really interest us .
For instance , in my own expenriece , when I visit a museum i like to spend enough time looking at the pictures rather than the other things .
If i have to follow a tour guide during a trip , it could happen that he or she will show the group the things that he or she considers important for her/his own , but it could be less important for me .
This could be dissapointed in the case that you cannot move forward to really enjoy or see what you really want to do .

Moreover , if you want to take any break during the trip , you will allow to do so if you are alone without asking anybody for permission .
We know if we travel with a tour guide in a group , you have to fully cooperate with everybody , and if you take a break will affect the group and their schedule .

In conclusion the best way to travel is alone , without a group or guide to follow as per all the above mentioned reasons .
of that
