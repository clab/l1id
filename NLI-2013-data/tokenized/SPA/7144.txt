Nowadays most of the people could n't do without their car .
There is no doubt that the grade of dependance upon the car varies considerably depending on the culture and the country we are focusing on .
For example , in the american way of life a car is simply essential , while the citicens of Amsterdam , for instance , make a greater use of bicicles than cars .
However , we desperatly depend on something that must have and end and whose end is unlikely very close : oil .

Therefore , everybody would agree in the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Perhaps twenty years is n't a long time but I 'm sure that we are at a turning point .
In my opinion there have already ben made incredible improvements that would have helped us to move towards ecological cars .
However , i 'm certain that at this point it has n't been interesting economically speaking puting them in the market .
More than once have we heard in the news that an engineer has finally discovered how to build a car that works with hidrogen or other organic materials .
However , just as happens with the powerful industry of medicaments , sometimes an improvement is ironically not benefitial .

I probably sound tremendously skeptical but I must say that I 'm hopeful that someday not in a long time somebody will make a car that does n't pollute and depends on a renovable good .
That would definately cause an increase in that car 's demand , what would mean a dicrease in the use of the traditional car .
Anyway , even if my best wishes do n't come true , I would still believe that in twenty years time a decrese in the use of the traditional car will occur in the developed countries .

To ilustrate my point I will take China as an example .
The population in China is huge and , while most of Europe and North America has already experiences a crazy developing period that has lead them to industrialisation and our actual welfare , China and many other asiatic countries are now at that point .
And , unlikely , we can not demand en ecological consciousness from them , when we ourselves have had non of it .
And if all the chinese buy a car ...
