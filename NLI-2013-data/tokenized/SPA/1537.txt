Although it is important to have thorough knowledge of a specific subject , it is essential to have a general wisdom of diverse academic themes .
The World is becoming more competitive every day and we are demanded to have a greater range of abilities .
Examples such as globalization and socialization are important to illustrate this point .

Thanks to technology , The World is becoming unified .
The relationship between countries 's economies is increasing exponentially .
Because of this we find now that many companies are working globally and have established headquarters in several parts of the worlds .
For this reason , we are now forced to learn at least two or three languages in order to successfully relate with consumers from other places .
If a person is good at selling a certain product , his skills would be useless if he could not communicate properly with a buyer that did not speak his language .
This example shows the importance of having at least some knowledge concerning other academic subjects , in this case languages .

Not only in our work life is it important to have general knowledge but also in our private : when we go to a party or a reunion , we like to socialize with a lot of people .
Because of this , all sorts of topics of conversation are discussed .
The conversation can be about any academic area as long as it is in the interest of the speakers .
If a person wants to join a conversation about biology , for example , he has to know something about the subject , otherwise he will be forced to listen and will be reluctant to participate .
If we have a general knowledge about several themes , then we speak our minds without any doubt and therefore , we will enjoy the party more .

It is clear that by being familiar with diverse subjects or themes , we will make our life much easier .
Not only is it important when it comes to work , but general knowledge can be applied to something as common as a reunion .
A person that is cultured always creates a good impression no matter what is the ocassion .
