This is a hard question , because succes means not the same thing for all the people , and also because both ways can take you to succes .

In my case , I am a tennis player .
For me succes would be to become a Professional Player .
For this to achieve there are no secret formulas , there are no new things to try , nothing like that , but doing what must be done , and what has been done since the early years of this sport , working for it .
Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind `` if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new '' , so succesful tennis players do not take great risks , nor try new thing , they just do what they know they do best , and stick to it if it is working .

So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject , if something is giving you succes , why changing it ?
Maybe if you are just in search of that `` success '' in other subjects rather than sports you should try new things , for example in pizzas , we have Dominoes , Pizza Hut , Peter Piper Pizza , etc ...
so maybe thinking in subjects like this it is hard getting success following the same steps others did long ago , beacuse of all the competition , maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so compited subject , so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things , explore new markets etc ..
but if you find success with something do n't try to change it , as long as it is giving you what you look for keep doing the same , or if you something well , no matter there is a lot of competition , keep doing it , because if you really do your thing well , people will notice about it and results will arrive sooner or later .
