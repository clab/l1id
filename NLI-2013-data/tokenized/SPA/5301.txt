At the same time that companies are producing more products , it has been necessary in order to be competitive in the consumer world to create effective ways to advertise them .
In that pressure generated by companies , they are producing products that seem to be much better in the advertisements than they really are .
Although not all products can be categorized with the statement , I agree with it .

One reason to explains this , it is to see how food companies advertise its products .
To be more specific , we could use McDonalds advertising campaigns .
On these , the way that a burger is presented is much better comparing with the same burger that you buy at any restaurant .
The size , the colors , the ingredients are not compared with the one that you see on the TV ad .

On the other hand , because this effective advertisements are reproduced in more revenues , companies keep using them in order to mantain growth .
And that continue behavior is generating confusion among the consumers that rely usually on these ads to buy some products .

Another reason why companies are using this strategy is that tipically they have competitors .
All of them want to improve their sales by producing this type ads that definetily convince people to buy products .
Therefore , the market departments on this companies start to develop this type of ads that are necessary in order to mantain a good position in the market .

Although companies usually rely on this type of method , others think that this is unethical and never try to reproduce or show better quality in their products .
Furthermore , some products may not applied in this type of ads so for them it is not possible to use that strategy .
For example insurance advertising .
They just can show what advantages they have .
These are according with the reality .

Finally , in order to protect consumers rights , several institutions have been created .
They rule and measure ways that products can be shown , and also they must be conform with the reality .
However , these institutions have not been enough to control this type of business behavior and this still occur in the US market .
