In the recent years , I 've travelled a lot around the world and learned about many different nations .
I 've travelled mainly to the United States , Europe and around the continent where I live , South America .
Many times you get lost or bored beacuase you are in a new place and with people you dont even know .
So , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Tour guides are generally very experienced people and often know a lot about the place you are visiting .
They know very well , and have studied the different places you are visiting , and also , they will answer any question you would like to know .
For example , I went once to a guided tour with some university friends to Sao Paulo , Brazil .
This experience was amazing because in only six days I could learn a lot and maybe more of the history of the city than some native brazilian citizens .

Many people think travelling with a tour guide is too expensive , but the experience is worth of it .
If you travel with a large group of people , you can divide the cost of the tour guide and you 'll definetely enjoy your trip .
Also , when you travel with a large group of friends , you will have remarkable and unforgettable experiences of it .

Finally , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because tour guides are very experienced people , you also enjoy the trip a lot with the group of people you are travellng with , and this way of travelling is not so expensive .
I 've done this a lot of times and it has worked out .
What you can learn from a tour guide and the moments with your friends are memorable .
