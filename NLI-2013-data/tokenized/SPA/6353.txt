In these days many topics have become important points of discussion .
One of this , is the belief that in the future less cars will be use because of consequence of different reasons .

In my opinion , we will still use cars in twenty years time but no for so much longer and no as much as we use cars now .
The main reason why I think this way , is because obviously our natural resources are decreasing very quickly , especially , the petrol and everybody knows that this it is a limited resource .
Anyway if we still have some , in twenty years time , the price of petrol will be so expensive than just a few people will be able to afford it , and it would be reflected in the number of cars in use .

Another reason to support my idea is that hopefully , harder laws in relation to enviromental and ecological issues will be aplied , therefore people will be more concern about the danger we are exposing earth just using our cars everytime we want to go somehere .

But , probably , more than anything else , the reason cause I thing cars will no be in use as much as they are today , is that important changes in transportation , distribution of the cities and new energetic resources will come soon .
Maybe new discovers about the use of nuclear energy will help to develope new ways of tranportation or will increase the private use of the aeroplane .
If we think , that probably the cities will be situated far away from each other and in more isolated areas , with no roads , the use of the aeroplane as private transport will be very usefull .

Summarizing , if the volume of cars will remain the same , will reduce or increase , is a question that will be anwered in a very short while .
Meanwhile , I think we should start reducing the use of automobiles and bidding for alternatives ways of tranportation as the train , tube or tram which are more favourable to our enviroment .
