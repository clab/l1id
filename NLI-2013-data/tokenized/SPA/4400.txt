With the time , advertisements have been popular because they sale products in the market .
Therefore , I agree that they make products seem much better than they really are by improving their appeareance and convicing the people who buy them that they can be useful , knowing that the reality could be another .

Advertisements improve the appeareance of the product by making it attractive to custumer 's eyes .
Then , some products like shampoo or soap seem to be good eventhough they are not , but publicists have the ability to trick the customer with some white hoax such as showing people who have wonderful hair and skin in television and meke them lie us by telling us that the product really worked in them improving their life quality .
As a result , we decide to buy it and just try it .

To convice the custumer is a goog way to enhance the product popularity because this is like a chain , in which the information can be spread easily .
therefore , to anunce that a product have many advantages than others such as heathy food , which is a popular subjet now , can convice people to buy and really spread the information to their family and friends , so finaly everybody belive in it .

In conclusion , the mayority of advertisement have been maken to attract customers attention by enhancing the product appearance and finally convincing everybody that they are useful , so the possibility to sale it in the market is always greater because people always belive .
Perhaps , we enjoy advertisements and we like the world plently of lies .
