Nowadays , in our society , we have two important problems that make me agree with the statement given .
The first of that problems is the pollution .
Human beings are generating a lot of pollution , and one of the most polluting elements is the car .
Many experts explain that problems like the climatic change and the problem with the atmosphere is cause by the smokes of cars and factories , specially factories related wtih the production of fuel for the cars .

The second problem is that it is thought that energy sources like petrol will disapear in few years becouse of his great demand , so maybe in few years there are not going to be cars because of the fact that they do not have petrol , so they wil not able to work .

On the other hand if someone could discover a new energy source , like for example the water , the second problem told before would disapear .
Instead of that I believe that in a few years some new invention will be discover , a new transport way will be designed and so the car will be an old fashioned transport .
I think that something will be invented for two reasons , the first one is that in the era we live now , the technology is in constant develope so the discovering of a new invention is only a question of time .
The second reason is that becouse of the problem of pollution , if we want to preservate our enviroment it is neccesary the discover of a clean and safe tranports .

In conclusion , I agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than now , with the help of the technology we will apreciate this in few time .
