It would be beautiful to believe that twenty years from now fewer cars would be circulating on our streets ; but the sad truth seems to be that , in that period of time , many more vehicles will fill our streets and contribute to polluting our world .

On one hand , it is true that technology is rapidly evolving and that what today is `` brand new '' , tomorrow will be completely obsolete .
The perfect example of this is computers .
PCs become obsolete almost as soon as they are finished .
The same thing applies to cars .
It could be that the great love that many have for cars today , died tomorrow due to a guilty conscience or environmental awareness .
People could start using other means of transportation that pollute less .
Or the automotive industry could create a new way of collective transport that would lead to less cars on the streets .

On the other hand , it is difficult , in a such globalized environment , to believe that the main mean of transportation : the car , will , in such little time as twenty years , be less used .
The fact of the matter is that cars are all around the world .
Everybody needs one to go everywhere .
Even young adults try to prove who they really are to others thanks to the car they own .
In New York , for example , not everybody owns a car , but taxis are available for those who need them which is , basically , the same thing .
How does someone from a small town go to work in a big city ?
By car , even when there are buses or trains available .
One could walk or go by bicycle to many places in his or her town : groccery store , post office , etc. , but many still prefer driving .

We have to face the truth .
I disagree completely with the statement because I do not believe that our world is moving in that direction .
We are still not aware of the great stress cars are causing on the environment and I do not think that we will be in twenty years .
It is not that I am not hopeful , I am , and I really hope that I am wrong in not believing in humans , it is just that I look out into our lives and I see what is there , not what I wish to see .
