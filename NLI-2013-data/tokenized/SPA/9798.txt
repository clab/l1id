First of all , I would like to say that I agree with the statement .
In my opinion success in life has to be with risks .
One can be doing well in their lives ; for instance , one person can be a good profesional in his field , but very often happens that people tends to go following the easy way .
For example , our hipothetical person can be a good teacher in a High School nad for that reason he will stay forever in the same school , or teaching the same level of students .
He , might be to have quite an interesting life , but while doing the same he is not going to `` grow up '' .

I think that for that person would be more interestin to continue studying , try to get a Masters degree in his field , and after that work in a college as a teacher at that level .
Of course , he is going to need to work hard ; teaching in his school , and after that going to the college , and his life during that time is going to be busy and stressful .
Also the risks he takes while trying to fullfil his dream is going to derivate in panic sometimes , but at the end , he will feel that life makes sense .

Sometimes people need to take the risk of changing the place of residence to try to have a better life or job , and they could feel panic .
I am always in the opinion of moving on to have new opportunities , which can have the consequence of success .

In conclusion , I admire those people that are not affraid of changes when the idea is to be a more interesting person and live a more interesting life .
