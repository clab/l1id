There are many forms to travel to somewhere , many people prefer to travel alone , others in a group , some of them without tour guide and others acompanied or led by a tour guide .
I think that the best way is traveling in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons : You knows where are you going in order to have a security , you increase your knowledge from the tour guide about other place , and you save time to do other activities .

Firt of all , it is important to know where you are going in order to have a security .
There are many places to know in the world or just in your country .
The places look nice on the pictures however each place has its particular risk that we do not know loking the picture .
I remember when I went to Amazonas river without tour guide , I had a bad experience in this trip .

Secondly , If you travel to somewhere it is a good idea to learn about this place and improve your knowledge about other place .
The best way to learn is hiding a tour guide because they are trained and they know very well the place that you are visiting .
I remember an experience in Machu Pichu .
When I arrived to Cuzco my group looked for a tour guide .
We really enjoyed in this trip because the guide teach us everything , he gave us all the historical of every place .

Finally , being led by a tour guide is a good idea to save time in your trip , because you are not worried about the map or you are not worried about the names of the different places .
However in this time you can enjoy more visiting other places or write your history or write emails to your friends .
Definitelly , I recomend It is a good idea to enjoy more in your trips being led by a tour guide .

In summary , there are more advantages having a tour guide like to support a job , to make other friend ( guide ) in other country , but I consider that the most important reasons are : security , knwoledge , and time .
