I do believe successful people try new things and take risks .
I believe life is full of opportunities that can benefit us , but we have to be ready and willing to accept this opportunities .

If a person just sits around and keeps doing the same than his/her life will become in a rutine .
Risks are always good because they motivate the person and makes a person give it 's best to achieve it 's personal goals , It 's always good to try new things .
A person has to look at it in a way that if nothing comes out of this than its not a lost , its actually a win , because you earned experience .

Experience is a very valuable gift a person acquires over time .
Nobody is born with experience , life gives a person the experience required to become successful and not fail .
Successful people have already obtained a certain degree of experience that has taken them to the spot they are located at .
A good example of how experience helps and is acquaired would be that a guy recently graduated with a business major , would n't be able to run a company by itself .
He probably has the knowledge , but not the experience to know what to do , or what decisions he needs to take , or how the company is run .

Important personalities in life have taken risks .
One good example is Cristopher Columbus .
He took the risk of sailing through the ocean , because he had a dream that the earth was round , and not flat like everybody said it was .
He took that risk and he had a great outcome , he found America .
If he would sat around and just believed what everybody else was believing in and just traveling in the same route everybody was , than he would n't have never found the glory he found when he decided to take that risk .

Life is full of risks , and we have to be well prepared in order to confront them , and when they come we do n't have to be afraid of taking them because we do n't know what we might found or the outcome of them will be .
A person wont become successful just wishing and dreaming they were successful , What they need to do is get up and go out and overcome all types of adversities .
