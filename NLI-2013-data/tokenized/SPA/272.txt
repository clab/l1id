There is this theory that it is more importante for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , I desagree .

I believe a student should both learn facts and understand ideas and concepts , because good education must be based on both rather than focussing on one or the other .

For instance , a student must understand the concept of democracy in order to study history , but he also must learn some relevant events in history to fully understand the meaning of the concept democracy .

I believe the learning of facts is not contrary to the understanding of ideas and concepts , in the long run , you may forget a lot of the facts you were thought , but at some point they were absolutelly necessary to understand the underlying concepts and ideas .

Throughout ones life we forget and learn facts as we continue in the process of understanding new concepts and ideas .

An education based solely on facts will produce students who are unable to conect those facts and produce original ideas and opinions , while an education based exclusivelly on understanding will make for adults not fit to interact in a cultivated enviroment .

The basic approach to education has changed significantly in the last 50 years , our parents were thought rough facts , they were forced to memorize endless ammount of information to be repeated over and over again , while younger generations were brought up under the impresion that memorizing facts is useless , in my opinion , neither is desirable , nor the student who is full of facts but lacks in analisys , nor the student who doesnt know the names or the most important capitals of the world or the basic facts in its countrys history .

I also believe education should be balance because students will be likely to study in diferent institutions throughout their lives and a well rounded education allows them to better adapt to the different teachig methodologies and approaches to education that each particular institution has .
