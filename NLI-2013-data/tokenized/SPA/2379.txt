Wisdom is usually associated with age .
The older we get , the wiser we become .

I agree with this idea because experiences teach us what to do and what not to do .
For example , a child could cut himself by picking up a knife from its blade rather than the handle , but he will learn not to do it again .

In other words , young people do not enjoy life more than young people because they learn through pain .
This does not mean adults do not experience pain , but they know how to avoid it better .
In some way , adults have learned to distinguish the roads that lead to joyful events rather than painful ones .

A perfect example would be the use of alcohol .
Young people tend to binge-drink because they have not learned to distinguish how much alcohol their bodies can tolerate .
On the other hand , grown-ups have already learned this after repeated hangovers , and instead , they learn to experience the taste of a good wine .
Something potentially harmful becomes a pleasure instead .

However , it is not a rosy picture for grown-ups because they have more responsabilities than young people .
Yet , responsabilities usually comes hand in hand with more freedom .
This gift of freedom is not a blank cheque because one has to work hard to earn money and be responsible for oneself .

But on the other hand , kids depend too much on their parents ' time and money .
They may have a lot of fun , but their freedom to move and do as they please is limited .
If kids and teenagers living in big cities want to go to the movies , they usually need their parents to drive them to the cinema .
They could do it alone by bus , but parents are sometimes afraid something could happen on the way .

To sum up , youger people do not enjoy life more than older people because as the years go by , one acquires independence and experience .
These two elements in my value system are not a magic keys to instant happiness but they are keys for doing whatever makes us happy without falling into painful situations .
