I do not agree with the topic .
I think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .

One of the reasons for my disagreement with the statement is that twenty years ago there were fewer cars than today .
I can remember going arround the city I live twenty years ago and there were not as many cars as there are today .
So , if the world still growing the same way , in twenty years we will have plenty of cars in use .
Although I think cars are very usefull , I find the traffic very annoying for the day life , but I have to learn to live with it as I think the number of cars is going to rise even more than we have today .

Moreover , another reason to think that we will have more cars in the future is that the prices will get lower and people would be able to buy a car .
Ages ago a television was so expensive that only a few could buy it , but throughout the years the television has become so popular and common that the prices have low down .
That is what I think it is going to happen with cars .
I also think more second hand cars will be in sale , so people will be able to get them and as a result we will have more cars in use .

In conclusion , I do not think in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today as the world is expanding so quickly and it is overcrowding over the years .
