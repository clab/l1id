Historically , people have aquired knowledge in a broad general way while they are young and are growing up , and that knowledge usually narrows down to something more specific when high school ends and college begins .

Some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while other people believe that one should specialize in one specific subject .
In my view , attaining knowledge of various academic subjects makes for a more disperse and unfocused way of life .

Firstly , learning about many things is something that comes naturally in life .
As we live our every day experiences we learn different things , but in contrast , what we choose to follow as a career should be the unique subject that interests us the most to a point of dedicating a great part of our lives to it .

During our academic years where we learn about a trade or a specific way something is done which we will then apply in real life to better our way of living , get the things we want for ourselves or create new systems for the future in the society we live in , we should strictly stick to one subject with its adjacent issues and not to many academic subjects that would make us loose focus and in the end not relate to anything at all .

Secondly , Learning about only one subject will make us waist a lot less energy , thus making us advance at a quicker pace towards our goals and not making us loose interest on the way .

Moreover , there are very few people in history who have dedicated their lives to many things , like for example Leonardo Da Vinci , who was an overall inventor , artist , investigator and doctor , but we can also say that he was really a eye-opener in a time where people needed to know and discover many things about the world they lived in .

Nowadays , with the Internet and what has become a visual era where the senses are constantly bombarded with information about our environment and the world we live in , the more important it is that we stey focused on one thing at a time instead of many .

In conclusion , I think it is much better to specialize in one specific academic subject than many different ones because it makes one concentrate more on what is personally important and therefore lets one view what is around in a different and better way .
