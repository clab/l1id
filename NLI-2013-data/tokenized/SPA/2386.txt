I agree with the statement : ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' , although it was not such an easy question and furtermore it has neither an easy or definitive answer .

I believe that some ( some , because it is impossible to generallyze in abstract themes as this one ) young people enjoy life more than older people mostly because they have less responsabilities .
As it is said : ` Those whom do n't know anything , do n't fear anything ' which means that the less you know the less you have to worry about .
By example , a six year old boy needs to be feed and he worries about it when he feels hungry , buy he does n't worry about who is bringing the money home to buy the food .
So , he enjoys life by being satisfied on his basic needs and by being able to play and experience life at this young stage .

On the other hand , older people , adults for example , generally have an income , they have money , they drive , they have an active social life and they can practically do whatever they want ...
this , gives them a sense of freedom .

I said before that this was not an easy question and either it was not easy to answer because it has many points to be anallyzed , so many that I believe it could be the topic of a professional research .
There are many variables : what can we consider as young people ( teenagers are a young segment of the population and they certainly do n't feel happy alll the time ) and what can be considered as old people ( Very old people are most of the time sick ; according to Jose Saramago : the old people lives going to nothing while the young people goes for everything ) .

But , in conclusion I think that is better to know many things , to be aware of what life has for each one - you can reach this state when you are an adult , even a young adult - and then enjoy life , knowing the advantages and challenges that life puts on your way to get almost anything : when something costs one a lot of work , it will appear to be better when it is obtained .

So that : I am older than other people and I enjoy life more than some younger people .
