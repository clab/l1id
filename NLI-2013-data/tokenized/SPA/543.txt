Party and Company is a game I play with my family and friends every time we want to share , have fun , and relax from the rutine of the week .
The objective of the game is to accumulate the greatest amount of points in order to win the first place .
Participants have to apply their knowledge of many academic subjects while playing this game .
Once , I had the opportunity to play this game with one of my sister 's best friend , Alesia .
Alesia is studying International Relations in a very well known university in the United States .
She is very smart and demostrated , while playing Party and Company , that she has a broad knowledge of many academic and importat subjects .

After experiencing how Alesia won this game and left us amazed , I can say that I agree with this statement .
Because she demostrated the importance of having knowledge of many subjects .
Alesia chose a major in Internatinal Relations .
By studying this major , she has the opportunity to learn about many subjects like politics , religion , economics , law , and cultures .

Specializing in one subject can be postive but it is better to know about many things that influence our society .
In order to succeed and make a difference in our society , people should be prepare and should know how to deal with different topics .
Today 's world is asking for persons who are very well prepared .
For example , the world needs women who not only are the base of their families , but also who can debate and state their point of view with concrete bases in the profesional context .

I would like to state that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , only if this knowledge is clear , concize and determined .
Because , it is not worth it to know about many topics if the ideas in which they are based , are vague .

Alesia is for me the best example of how this statement is true and I agree with it .
Because while playing this simple game , she demostrated to us how she knew about history , politics , nature , religion , culture , economics and supported his ideas with clear bases leading her group to win the first place .
