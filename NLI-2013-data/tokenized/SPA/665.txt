In order to contextualize an specific academic subject , there has to be a broad knoledge of many academic subjects .
The balance between the general knowledge one gains and the specific knowledge one pretends to obtain is an important one .
Both knowledges are co-dependant and inter-related with each other .

In my personal academic experience , I could say that the general knowledge in the Hummanities department , the Physical education department , the Antrhopology department and the Social Sciences department has led to a more profound and mature understanding of my specific field of study .
My undergraduate proposal was to combine all these fields in the performance arts , thus enhancing the possibility of a more organic and interdisciplinary approach to them .

By combining physical training ( in theatre arts and physical education classes ) with physcology , anthropology and humannities classes , one can achieve a more integral view of the human being within it ' s context .
By expanding knowledge into various fields , the being can enhance theatrical and creative performance in a self-concious way .
The body can therefore express it ' s integration in society by developing a language that articulates racial , academic and social background .
In other words , the body becomes a didactic space that expresses it ' s knowledge and transmits it to it ' s public .

The Spartans believed that a healthy mind in a healthy body is what made an integral citizen .
My undergraduate program reiterates this position and expands it by incorporating the body in the `` wholeness '' of academic development .
If one wants to be an instrument of knowledge for it ' s society , then one has to acquire a certain general knoledge of all academic fields , in order to transmit a concient and integral discourse to society .
My specific knowledge field , performance arts , is a great tool to transmit this discourse , using the body as a `` connector '' with it ' s society .
