Since I lack of experiences in young people participation in other countries , let me focus the topic geographically .
In Colombia , young people involving into their communities is quite common .
But , it is specially clear to see in low classes people .

This phenomena is not present in high classes youngs , as it is in low classes youngs .
My opinion is , I think the youngs who participate helping their community and contributing to its development are people who see that in their community something is missing and the think , they feel , they can do something in order to improve some life conditions .
For instance , a boy who likes playing football goes every weekend to the field .
Once he sees it without grass , it can be that he encourages other people playing with him to do something for improve this situation .
Then , they can collect some money from neighbors and buy the grass and fix a date to plant the grass and this way the may have a better field .

On the other hand , high class young people are not in touch with problems , because most of the times they are already solved by their parents .
So they do not feel the need to fix something because everything around them is fixed .
Besides , their priorities lie on studies , parties and some other aspects of life that do not include their communities .
Also , somehow their good economical situation makes them more individual , losing in some way the communitiy sense .
Taking the same example like above , a rich boy goes playing football in the social club , where his parents have some share .
This club will have for sure an excellent field with recently cutted , soft grass .
So this boy will not worry about grass .
He probably will worry about wether he will use the sauna or not , and if he will go to the pool with their colleagues after the game .

The situation illustrated is a common example of everyday life and a different way to see it depending on the observer .
For people who likes to participate , community sense is very important .
People who do not , simply do not mind .
