It would really depend on how much time I have to make the trip .
If I had more than two weeks to travel trough a city or two I would rather prefer to travel on my own and follow my own pace too , and more likely if it was a Historic city of the European Union .

If I had to do a fast tour through several cities in a short time , I would prefer to have a guide , so he or she could show me the most significative places to be seen in each city and I would not feel I missed the most important things .
Other good thing about guides is that they usually are very familiar to the place and its history , they know the little details , shops , stories , costumes and typical food every visitor has to try at least once to get to say they actually been there .
Maybe there wo n't be much time left to wander around looking at the arquitecture or the landscape furthermore than what the guide has already scheduled , besides there is always a great number of persons within the same group of tourists , taking pictures and asking questions all the time , so the tour can turn into a stressing race against time .

I would really prefer to travel on my own with plenty on time , but who would n't ?
Unfortunately that is not always possible .
It is always nicer to walk looking around at the same time , steping by little shops and cafes , talking to people , asking for directions , going to the places you choose to go to and discovering everything on your own .
I think that is the travel ideal for many of us , but we usually have a hard time on finding the time to do it that way , and instead make plans with too many destinations all at once in a small schedule .
