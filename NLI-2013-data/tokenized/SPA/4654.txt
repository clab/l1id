` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .
I completely agree with this statement .
This is because nowadays advertisement has become a very important issue for selling companies products , therefore it has become a great business .

Today the important of advertising products has become essencial for their success over the population .
This is why the importance of advertising and how products are shown to the population have increase in the past years .
This is mainly because of the media influencing the people .
More people watch television or listen to radio and therefore the companies with new products are encouraged to show these advertisements within these medias .
They know about the people reaction to them and that they let themselves be influenced by these , having a positive response from the population .

Therefore , through this media the companies have the opportunity to show their new products as they newest and more advanced technological creation , which most of the time is completely false .
The techniques they use to describe the benefits of these products are various .

For example there are many advertisements that take a good picture of the product and display it on a big pannel or on a magazine and when people look for the product they realize it is not what they expected to be .

Also this kind of ' false ' advertising is used mainly on the products which are asked by internet of by telephone .
These are the typical products that will dissappoint you .
Another example are those long television commercials in which a product is shown and all its advantages are described and many reasons why it has to be purchase are given .
In this way they start convincing and delighting you all the advantages described .
More over , in this kind of commercial in order to make even more efficient they show other people 's testimonial about the product .
In this way they convince you about the effectiveness of the product and therefore encouraging to buy it .

Finally , when the time comes to recieve the purchase product seen by television or by internet the expectations are really high but after using it few times you realize it was not as effective as shown in the advertisement .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This is one of the reasons for many products successes , making companies economy to increase .
