Most advertisements make you to see the good way of the product , but steel been bad , for example the cigarrets , bring a advertisement that if you consume that product can cause serios problems of cancer , so that is not the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are .

I agree that the product bring the advertisement , but dont make sure that is good , because the contain is the same .
So is not better product or worst if that bring and advertismenet but , make more value if thatt cause and effect like do not drink or smok , because can cause serios problems , and the people really dont buy it because they know the consecuences because the advertisement said .

A lot of people dont really care wath the advertisement say or may be just make joke about it , some of the baby products bring and advertisement that you cannot give to your child if it is less than 3 years for example , and the people just dont get it and they give it to their childs , so when something happend they dont want to asume the consecuences or they dont want to know that they have the fault .

I dont really think that an advertisment it is enough , sometimes we need more than advertisment to do not buy a bad productc .
But in the other hand , is not good to advertise for and industry to the people that their product is bad or can cause bad consecuences , becuse some of the population can stopped to buy it .

So , in conclusion I agree that the products most bring and advertisement but dont make better then they really are , so we have to take care of all products that we buy every day , and read what they are trying to said .
So thats is a I agree with this statement .
