Well , to see if I disagre or not with being traveling with a tour guide I have to explain first the advantages and the disadvantages .
Well , let 's begin .

The advantages

We can say that primarily there are four advantages to being traveling accompanied by a tour guide .

1. They have the experience that they know well the place in which you are traveling , most if it 's a different country or even a different city .
In case it 's a differente country in which there 's a different language talked , that 's a really benefit .

2. They know important facts that maybe one will not know in case you do n't know history or do n't understand the language .
3. I think , that the primarily advantage of being guid by a tour guide iis that you do n't get lost !
It 's normal that if you are visting a city or country for first time you can easily get lost , so , ther 's a great advantage !

4. A tour guide knows the principal places or the most common , the famous ones .

The disadvantages

About the disadvantages , there are also four ,

1. The first one is that you have to pay money !
HA ! ...
maybe you are traveling with exact money and you do n't have enough to pay a tour guide !
2. When you are guided by a tour guide you depend on the fastness he moves , maybe you want stay more time in some places and get out faster in other ones , but it depends on him , the tour guide .

3. Even the tours guide know many places , one can get into service offices and ask for information , you do n't have to depend on others !
4. And one important and final fact is that you can meet a lot of people by your own .
You can make a lot of friends , know lot of places you really want to visit , not only places all visit , instead many others !

Conclutions

I prefer traveling maybe with only a friend and between he and me I think it would be a great experience , without wasting and meeting a lot of people .
