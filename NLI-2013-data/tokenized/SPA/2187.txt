In the Western world most people consider that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I have recently been asked if I agree with that line of thought .
Contrary to what most people think , I consider that old people enjoy life more for a number of reasons : they have life achievements to look back to and be proud of ; they can see the influence they exert in their children and grandchildren ; and , they are experienced and see life from another perspective .

Through time older people have experienced positive and negative events .
They have been through moments in life , where everything has been about accomplishments and triumphs , like getting married or becoming a well-known doctor , and others where failure and tragedy , like closing a business or facing a close relative 's death , have played an important role .
However , throughout the years they have learned to balance all these experiences and see that life is beautiful , and that every accomplishment should be a reason to be proud of and every moment should be enjoyed to its fullest potential .

At the same time , older people are able to enjoy the influence they exert in their children and grandchildren , and see the effort they did throughout their life reflected on them .
It is difficult to see a higher pride or degree of accomplishment , than that shown on a grandfather 's face when playing ball with his grandson .
That is a sign of enjoying the little moments of life at their greatest potential , without worrying about the next day 's meeting , or the undone project sitting in front of the computer .

Older people see life from a different perspective than young people do .
And as a famous Latin American poet writes , `` if I lived again I would worry much less about being so careful , about wearing sweaters and always leaving home with an umbrella ...
I would travel without luggage and not be concerned of the day I have to come back ... ''
For these reasons I think old people enjoy life more than young people .
The good news is that we are still young and we can start enjoying life just as all of our grandparents do , taking from them an example for the rest of our lives .
