I am not agree with this statement .
I am not agree with this statement because , from my point of view , it wo n't be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .

I my opinon it will be more cars firstly because they will give a major utility and we could do many more things with our car than we can do today .
In twenty years time , cars will have everything included and you will be able to do whatever you want while you are driving .
This is one of the main reasons that I use to argue that it wo n't be less cars in the future than nowadays .

Another reason is that from my point of view , the number of cars will increased because they will be more sefety and this fact will aloud underaged people to drive a car because they will have many systems to prevent the accidents .

Since many time , cars have been the most safety transport in the world , and I think this is not going to changed , because cars companies moves a lot of money and they will do everything to sell more cars and make them more safety and comfortable .

Another fact that in my opinion will make the number of cars increase in the future is that the goverments are spending a lot of money in the rebuilt of many highways that will make the trevel by car more safety , comfortable a safer .

To sum up , I would like to say that for me , cars are a very important part in our daily life and it will be an more important in twenty years than there are today .
