When you want to travel to some place that you do not know , you have the posibility to visit interesting places with a tour guide .
I am agree to travel with a tour guide for many reasons :
First , because you can know a lot specific information about the place , that you do n't know .
Frecuently , a tour guide is a person that is prepared to give information about the place that you visit , not only with the information that is written in the bulletins .
For example , when I went last year to Veracruz , I could know many histories about the place , that I did not know , it not was necesary to read the information and it was so great the time that I expend there .

Second , a tour guide could give information about where and what is the best place for buying a present that could remember the place .
Because some times you may find the same thing or git less expensive in the place that he or she recomended .

Third , he or she could give a recommendation about the best picture , that you can get for you album .
Beside my opinion is agree to have a tour guide when you travel , sometimes I am disagree when I do not have a lot of money , and I prefer to spend it in other thing , for example : typical food or clothes .
Also because sometimes to take a tour take a lot of time and you may arrive late at place and you do not have enough time for expend by yourself if you have a guide .
