Marketing Success

It is not uncommon to hear or read opinions regarding products and how they are not what they were expected to be .
This is partially the fault of marketing and their advertisements , since what they do is create a perception of a product that may not be totally true in reality .
This is why I agree with the statement presented , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
.

A product can be anything from an idea , to something we consume .
Marketing 's objective is to increase acceptance of a product by using schemes to create a necessity and convince the end users to obtain that certain service , product , or idea .
It gets interesting when the `` acceptance '' translates into sales .
Which will bring important insights to my argument .

Since acceptance means buying a product , then advertisements may tend to exaggerate or seduce potential customers to persuade them into buying .
Since buying brings money to the company , and companies love money , more effort is put into adverstisements and marketing to boost sales .
So to speak , we are tricked by pro 's into buying .

This is probabbly why we are sometimes fooled by advertisments .
They are carefully made by experts who know what target market they want to reach , how they want to reach it , and , most importantly , how to convince that market .
These experts have studied psychology , learned about human behavior , performed surveys , and thus know how to adequately sell a product .

This scheme , this advertisement , triggers psychological needs that we have and makes us buy the product .
We sometimes do not need it , but we end up buying it because how well it was sold .
And it is after we assimilate how valuable this product , idea , or sevice really is to our daily lives that we then realize how we `` percieved '' a product to be better than what it really is .
It is as if we removed a blind fold , or eliminate the drug that fooled us into buying that good .
We understand how it is not a real necessity , and so , how that product is not as good as we thought it was .

The purpose of advertisements is to boost sales by convincing customers to buy a product .
We may get tougher and smarter , but advertisers will also get tougher and smarter .
What we then have to realize is how a product will improve and satisfy personal daily needs .
This way we will not get fooled into buying something that is not as good as we were tricked into believeing ...
