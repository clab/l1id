I disagree with the steatement because , in my opinion , it is better have a lot of knowledge about one specific subject , that to know only a little of many academic topics .

On the one hand , even though a lot of persons can think that having information about a variety of subjects could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation , on the other hand , I consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area .
Is always better to understand perfectly one thing than to have a small idea of many things .

Thereby , to have a large knowledge in one single academic subject have practical applications because , it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolidated information to others .
Moreover , some specifics points of the academic life , according to my opinion , can only be achieved with a huge knowledge of one topic .
For instance , to make a research in one area , it will be necesary to count with a lot of information in that subject .
However , to have an idea of several topics will be useless to develope deepely enough the investigation accuratelly .

Furthermore , to understand perfectly one single subgect could have potentially a large economic benefit , for in some circunstances , diferent companies and industries needs persons with specific knowledge about one area to solve a punctual problem .

In conclusion , I believe that to focus oneself in studing deeply a single subject instead of studing a large number of academic areas will bring always more possitive results .
