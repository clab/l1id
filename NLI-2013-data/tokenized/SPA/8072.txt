IDEAS AND FACTS

I desagree with the statement , because the facts are important as the ideas and concepts , the are connect because the ideas and concepts give the students the facts , they are always behind , in any explication and understanding of ideas and concepts , we have to consider the facts , to have a deeper reasoning about what we want to learn , but why some people not consider facts as important ?

Many people think that the concept or meaning is the only thing that matters , because they are superficial and do n't look behind to see the FACTS .
For example , in a high school , the students are only interest in learning the concept as it is , not to know what cause it , or why it is there , this lack of interest on going deeper on the information they have , led them to not be well prepare to present some knowlege tests , but also the teachers do n't pay attention to this lackness in their students , so the students only understant the ideas but not learn the facts that remarks that idea .

It is important to always have some facts , so that we can make a better analizis to the theory , that involves the ideas and the concepts , analyzing all the things we have in our head , to make a better job .

This doesnt mean that the ideas and the concepts are not important , thay are very important because with them is that we can take in account the facts , so undestanding ideas and concepts are very , very important , to have a clear thought of what we have .

This is like when a bird born , at the begining it is only interest or focus on the food the mother give him , but later needs to know the facts that involves how the mother obtains the food , how she procceses it , and how he can do that .
Are things that maybe at the beginig it doesnt put attention but at the end would be very an important thing to him .

Can be concluded , that the facts , and the ideas and concepts , are both very important to have a better knowlege about something , that when we see the concept , we also have to consider the facts that are behind .
