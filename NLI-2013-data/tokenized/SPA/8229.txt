Students education should be complete in order to let young people develop their own way of thinking in all the majors like maths , physics , psicology and art .
That the students learn facts is a good way to understand ; however , to learn ideas and concepts is a way to develop their way to think and to understand facts .
There are some reasons why to learn ideas and concepts is better that just learn facts .

First , ideas an concepts permit the individual to understand facts .
For example , in sociology to understand the fact that the Beatles were so famous whe ca n't just said because of their music was very good .
We have to go deeper and think that they were famous because the idea that they develop in youn people about freedom and happiness .
The result was that young people idea about be free was reflected in this band .
So , basically the ideas later become concepts .

Then , most of the theories of any branch of study are based on ideas and concepts accepted for the experts .
That 's how science works .
Scientists develop their reasearch based in concepts already establish long long time ago in order to define another concept .
The we can said that a fact is representation of ideas and concepts .

Finally , facts come when an idea or concept is represented in something that happened .
We can said that is and example .
In terms of the education facts help to understand how things develop , For example , how human being appeared in this world .
There are some natural concepts , ideas and theories that are just that supositions but the fact is that the human being exist and we do n't have still an aswer .

As a conclusion , the relation between ideas , concepts and facts are close .
The first two develop the las one .
The reason why is better to know ideas and concepts is beausea in this way you can find a fact
