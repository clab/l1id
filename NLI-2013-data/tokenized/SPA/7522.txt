I disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
I disagree mainly by three reasons .
First , even though the tour guide is an specialist in the zone or city that you are going to visit and you can get a more complete knowledge of that zone or city , I think that a good book of the city can supply in a correct way the knowledge of the tour guide .
A good book have history of the city , routes of interest , architectural and archeological points to visit and legends of the city among other things .
Using a book of the city in your travel can help you both to acquire the knowledge that you would acquire with the tour guide and to plan the route to follow .

Second , when you travel with a tour guide , you have the schedules restriction .
For example the plan says 8 am breakfast , 9 am visit to the museum , 1 pm eating ...
And you have to respect the schedule .
You do not have enough freedom .

On the other hand , when you travel without a tour guide , you can assign the time that you want to the different activities .
If you want , you can get up more late in the hotel , or if the visit to the museum is bored , you can end the visit and go to drink a coke or visit other thing .
In other words , you can assign the time to every activity , and not be restricted by an schedule .
You can enjoy the places by the time that you want , no by the time that a tour guide wants .

Third , traveling with a tour guide , restrict you the route or itinerary .
For example your travel can be limited to 7 or 8 places and you can not add or quit a place .
Traveling with a tour guide will allow you to decide wich places to visit .
Your travel will not be limited by a determined number of places .
If you want you can add or quit places to visit , the route is not fix .
You can visit the places that most attracts your attention .

In conclusion , for me is more exciting to travel without a tour guide because I can get more freedom in my travel and I can decide which places to visit and for how many hours .
I am not limited by the schedules or routes of a tour guide .
