Advertising has been used by people in many ways to express their ideas about an specific product or service .
It is a commercial way to communicate the advantages of the articles or services that are selling .
Is important to analyze the use of advertising in certain campaings , because not allways the use some type of advertising is ethically aproved by Peple .
Advetising must reflects the real product or service that the communicators are trying to sell , there are some attributes that are hidden and that do not reflect the real product .

First of all , the business needs some way to comunicate what they are selling , to achieve this they have different channels of communication , for example TV , radio , newspapers and other printed media .
The persons who create this type of messages needs to convence the potential client , that this product is going to solve their necessities , in other way the advertising will lost its purpose .

Certain advertising campaings , are designed to catch te customer attention in a way that is not ethically accepted for every one , and this is the case of the use of hided messages that goes directly to the subconcious mind of the customer , that He or She can not perceive .
In some cases , come people consider this type of advertising as INTRUSIVE , because it does not giving the opportunity to the consumer to decide if they receive or no the message , is something like a `` mind pop up '' , where people receive the information when they are not asked for it .
This is a big issue related with the ethics of advertising .

In the other hand , and also related with etics , is the fact that Advertising does not reflects what sellers are really selling .
This people hide some important attributes of the product that can cause a bad image of it , for example , some customer wants to buy a car that He o She saw in some media , the announcement says that the car has an special gide to localize it globally , and the person who is moving around the USA , for instance , desire that car becuse it has this special item .
What the customer does not knows is that this special item is given only for the first five units selling .
This is a clear example that reflects how some people does not agree with this type of advertising that does not reflects the reality .

Advertising must use to give a clear image of the product or service that sellers a selling , but it does not imply that they have to use any kind of strategy to achieve this goal .
Consumers must claim their rights , because they are paying for it .
