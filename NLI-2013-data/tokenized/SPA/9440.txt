Well , it depends of the kind of person , I think we all have sundry of answers and thougts about this statement , in my personal opinion I think it is more important to students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
However I am not saying that it is not important to learn facts , but for me the most important is to developed this ideas and concepts in usual life .

In the first place , when students learn in a classroom , most of them studied for the exam and no for life .
For that reason I think it is important for the teacher to developed some outside class excersises , in that way they will be able to practice and really live this hypotetical situation , I am totally sure that this will be more efective than to be inside of the class talking and talking about the theme , because you not also will understand the idea and the concept , you will also remembered this maybe for the rest of your life , if you have a good memory of course .

In the second place , when we memorize special concepts in class and we have a final test at the end of the year , we usually do n't remember this special fact , because during the year there are so much activities , exams , quizes , and practices that are very hard to remember all , we only keep the idea and the concept in our minds .

Meanwhile , if you do a research of your work , maybe asking some students all around your college , or university you will find out that they prefer outside activities , in that way they can get the idea fastern than to learn the fact .
On the other hand there are some students that prefer to learn facts because for them it is easier to understand and asimilate .

Finally I think that this is the world were we live , we will find a variety and several persons with different opinions and concerns about life , studies , and whatever is in our minds , but in this speciffic answer now you know my opinion , for me it is easier to lern ideas and concepts , maybe for you is the same , or maybe not .
But now , you can understand me a little bit more .
