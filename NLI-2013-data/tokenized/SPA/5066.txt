I do agree with this statement cause I studied business administration and i know that if you want to insert a new product in to your market you cannot just sell a normal regular product that you just invented , you have to sell the salvation the their needs , you sell a solution you sell something they have been desiring for all their lifes .

That 's why is so important to show the products is defferent escenarios , to show examples of how this product improved these people 's life and therefore invite the potential consumer to take the step of improve their own lifes .
In marketing you learn three things for any product that you want to launch to the market .
Product , Place , Price and Promotion .

For example , is important to be aware of the visual part of the Product , is necesary to show that the first impression is the adecuate one , also that this product contains all the expectations of what the customer requires for their needs .

The place is also a master peace of this marketing strategy because you have to see which is the type of consumer you want to sell , either is to a very high educated class or to the non-smokers or whorever is the choise .
Youa have to find the right spot .

In matter of prices the product has to be balance the cost of the good with the benefit that will bring the costumers , the relevancy of this point can lead to the success of failure in the market .
It is highly recomended to make a deep study of the market you want to reach and ask then how much would they pay for these types of products .

At the time you want to make the promotion of this product you really need to see wich is the channel you want to use for this , either is the TV or newspapers , wherever is the place you have to make sure that the product you are trying to sell will take the attention of the consumer you are trying to catch .
That 's why sometimes the advertisers play very much with the emottions of the consumer and lead the people to beleave more things about this product than they should .
