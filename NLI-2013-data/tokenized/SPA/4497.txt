I aqgree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
I think that I 'm not alone in this matter .
It happens almost every day .
We are bombarding in so many ways with so many atractive products advertisements , that appeals our senses and pockets that it 's almost impossible to resist .
In one occasion , an andvertisement called my attention in a magazinne ; the picture , specifications , value and over everthing the total garantee of complete satisfaction or the money will be refunded no questions abou it , cought me up .
I bought the product and I got it , of course , it was n't the the way they pictured it literally .

I 'm thanked and glad , that there are laws which protect consummers from this type of commercialization ; that 's why the manufactures knows that not every body will be pleased to have their product and they give us the option to return it .

With this previous experince , I think before to buy .
I preffer to see , touch and evaluate the product before to buy it .
I ca n't say that always is like this , of course there are products that supports what they proclaim , but I think that there are not to many
