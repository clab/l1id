I agree with that , it is better to travel with a tour guide that travel alone .
It is less expensive that travel alone because you always pay for the hole trip ( if you pay to a travel agengy for the trip you pay all inclusive : the plane , the tikets , the hotels , the food and they give you the tour guide and the security )
You do n't enjoy alone .
You are always with peoples .
You are always sharing , speeking , talking , laughing .
You are never bored .
If you go to an interest place the travel guide are going to explain you the history of that place , why they construct that monument , what means , etc .
If you do n't speak the language of that country the tour guide can help you to understand the language or he can translate you whatever you want .
You ca n't loose , because they are always taking care of you .

They are going to help you with anything information that you need .

The tour guide is always nice , if they work alone they will give you the best price ( for you choose them ) .
I think that it is a good option for not travel alone .

The tour guide is a person that knows a lot about the place that you are visiting in that moment .
He is worried about you .
He can help you in save your money .
They are honest people .
Many works for the government too ( in my country you will see tours guides that are paying for the government ) .
