Nowadays there is great controversial over the time young people spend helping their communities .
Many years ago , it was very common seeing young people helping their communities in activities such helpings in churchs , schools and so on , during last years old people have noticied it has decreased the number of youths who help their communities .

From my point of view , it is a matter of fact that the number of young people who helped in their communities has decreased in last decade .
For instance , when i went to my church ten or fifteen years ago me and my friends helped to do all the things that the preacherman could not do by himself ; but as we have grown up there are no young peolpe who help in church and , in fact , the elder ones are those who help the preacherman in order to go on with the mass .

There are many reasons that can help to understand this problem .
In the first place young people are so ineterested in new technologies that they are forgetting so important values such as family or friends .
What i mean is that they spend so many hours playing with computers or watching TV that they forget what is really important in life which , i believe , is the people around you including family , friends and , of course , your community .
It is obvious that if you do not care about your family you will not care about your community .

On the second place , we live in such a competitive society that parents do not spend enough time with their children to educate them in the same as they were educated by their eldests .
As a result , young people have not received the learnings of helping those around them .

If you ask to me , i think that the lack of help from young people is an important problem because it is producing a great seperation between the young and old people in their communities , and the only way to resolve it is give a better education to the little ones in order to avoid this problem in the future .
