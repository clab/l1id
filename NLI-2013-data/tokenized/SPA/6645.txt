I completely agree with the proposed statement .
In my opinion , there are sound reasons to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .
First , I think that pollution has become a serious global problem that soon will have to be solved .
In addition , I believe that unaffordable oil prices will incentivate people to use other kind of transportation .

First of all , we may argue that nowadays almost everybody supports a dramatical reduction of pollution .
We all can agree that cars contribute to increase urban pollution .
In order to tackel this problem , some cities , such as London , have implemented new regulations that do not allow people to drive cars around the center of the city .
From what I see , much more cities should apply this sort of policies .
Likewise , many cities are currently improving the services rendered by their public transportation in order to provide people with a good alternative to the car .
I think that these two measures will incentivate people to avoid using the car ; thus , we may conclude that fewer cars will be in use .

Secondly , I consider that soaring oil prices will also help to have fewer cars in use .
From my point of view , oil has already started to be a really scarce good , and even now many people have problems to pay for it .
Hopefully , people will realize that using the car is not sustainable from both an ecological and an economic standpoint .

To sum it up , I do believe that in twenty years we will see fewer cars running through the streets .
We may expect that people will colaborate to reduce pollution and will start using public transportation .
In addition , I think that oil prices will prevent people from using the car or , at least , will incetivate people to use it less .
