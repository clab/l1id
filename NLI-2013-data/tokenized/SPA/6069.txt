In today 's society , which is characterized by a hectic way of life , the desire of going everywhere employing fewer and fewer time has dominated the transportation market .
The result is that in recent years the number of cars used has increased spectacularly .
But , will this trend continue in the following years ?
This is a very controversial issue .
On one hand , the enviromental problems and future supply shortage are pushing governments to face the transportation problems in different ways .
On the other hand , there are a big and powerful industry which will make hard to abandon the systems based on fossil fuels .
In my opinion , the current situation is bad enough to compell society to offer alternative solutions to this problem which will result in the decrease of the number of cars .

To begin , the amount of fossil fuels available is decreasing very rapidly .
Therefore , some time in the future will be no oil or gas .
This is a cogent argument which should compell governments to take some measures to prevent that situation .
This opens up a bunch of alternative possibilities to provide another means of transportation different from cars .
The first solutions should focus in reducing the use of fossil fuels .
This include enhance the use of public transportation , foster the use of bycicles in cities and so on .

Further solutions will take into account the substitution of fossil fuel dependent cars .
The new technology develop to overcome this problem will result in new types of machines , which can be similar to cars , but will be no longer the traditional cars .

Another crucial point , is the enviromental issue .
During the last years more and more people are aware that the use of cars contribute highly to the pollution .
In fact , in some big cities , such as Mexico D.F. and Milan , strict measures had to be taken in order to reduce the air pollution .
Such measures include restriction in the acces to the center , in the days of the week one can take the car , etc .
In conclussion , all the possible solutions indicates that a reduction in the number of cars circulating need to take place .

Summing up , keeping in mind all the problems mentioned above , it is clear that the current trend regarding the use of car can not be held .
Enviromental , social and technology arguments indicate that new means of transportation will gradually take the place of today 's cars .
Therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will be definitely less than the number of cars used today .
