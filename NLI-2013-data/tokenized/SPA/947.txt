Knowledge is a very powerful tool .
The more you know about something , the better informed and prepared you are on the subject .
If having knowledge in one area is good , it 's even better to know about many subjects .
Having an integral education provides you with the base to be able to speak , even if at short length , about many topics .
You are able to move throughout a wider social spectrum because you can relate to a larger group of people .

That being said I think it 's important to specialize in one specific subject .
Experts have a very important place in our society .
They are recognized by governments , academia and many other places .
Their specialized information is valued because other people do n't know it .
Specializing in one specific subject leads you down a path of expertise .
Even better is when you can specialize in more than one subject .
This way , you can combine different fields and create new paths of knowledge .

Specializing in a subject ( whether it be one or more ) also opens a space to community .
Although a specific subject might not have a large range of people attached to it compared to people who have a broad knowledge , it is a more close and tightly knit group .
There 's a development of traditions , rules and language that pertain to that specific group .
Take into consideration medical and legal jargon , which might sound like a foreign language to people who do n't have knowledge in that specific field .
It is a way to communicate with people from the same `` tribe '' .
People from similar fields also are able to develop very strong relationships because they can understand the complexities of a particular subject .

We cannot overlook the importance of having an education that comprises of a wide variety of subjects .
This training enables you to be a constructive part of society .
But since everyone ca n't be laying down blocks ( there 's also need of solders , sculptors , painters , etc. ) , there is also a need to specialize in a particular field so you can offer society the best part of yourself : your knowledge .
