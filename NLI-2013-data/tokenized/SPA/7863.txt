I am disagree .

I see those advantages of travel with a group using a tour guide :
- You do n't have to lost time in move from a place to other place ,
- You can share your own experience with other people with the same objective ,
- Do n't get worry about get lost or be in dangerous places ,
- Do n't have troubles with the language ,
- Make your days easy , because somebody else is explaining what you have in front of your face .

Advantages about travel by yourself :
- Know people from the city ,
- See more the village , walk next to the people , take the same air , eat the same food ,
- Tried to learn a language using some of their words ,
- Be a traveller where to learn their culture will be the first objective of your travel ,
- Ask where and how to know more about the city .

I traveled as part of a group using a tour guide and was just a bad experience .
You are so rigid to any wish or activity you would like to do by yourself , for example : when you are travelling with a group you have all the activities and the time depends of other person .
There are travels organized by time where you only get a city go to touristic places and go back .
You are travelling as as tourist .

I will prefer always to travel as a traveller , that makes you more fun in your travel , you know more the city , the people , the culture and brief more the air of the city or place you are visiting .
I was travelling a couple of time in Rome , the first time was with myself , i took a guide then i was walking around the city and see all the touristic places and eat in italians small restaurants .
Thats was wonderful , i meet italians that then invited me to eat to their house to see an italian house , how they were living .

With a group you will only listen some experience but not livinng those experience .
I like to travel a lot and always i tried to travel with myself or not more to a friend in this way we can enjoy and share our opinions .
Only we need a backpack , camera and documents ...
Oh and money will help a lot .
