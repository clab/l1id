THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IS IN A GROUP LED BY A TOUR GUIDE

I am agree with the statement because when you travel with a tour guide you have the chance to go to the most interesting places of the country you are visiting .
You can also meet the bether cultural , historical , and representative places , that you would n't know if you dont go with a tour guide .

For example , when you go to Buenos Aires , Argentina , is better that you do it with a tourist agent , because they would take you to the most historical and representative places of the city and you will know their history and learn special information about them .
When you go there you cant miss the neihgborhood La Boca , the place in wich is located the stadium of the best club team in latin america , `` Club Atletico Boca Juniors '' .
It 's a very beatiful place to walk but you have to go with a tour guide because in other way you would'nt appreciate all the history that is behind it .

If you travel alone , you will miss the chance to learn something new , and to live experiences like meeting new people from all above the world .
It is difficult that when you go into a trip by yourself , you wil meet all the pople that you can meet in a guided tour for the city .
In that way you could not just learn about the country you visit , but also about other countries in the world that you could go on a later trip to visit .

The advantages of going on a trip with a tour guide are huge .
You can not miss the chance of doing it , because on that way you will live the best vacational experience of your life .
You can learn about other countries customes and live for some days like a person of that country .
