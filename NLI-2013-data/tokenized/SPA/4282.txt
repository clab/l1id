According with the previous statement , young current people do not have a active role in the society , and I think that is true , but is not a big problem .

In my country is very common that young people do not have any interest in the national economy , politic or culture that surround themself .
They do not want to spend time helping other citizens in their communities .
They have the time , is true , but not for helping .
their `` reals '' interest are friends , video games and entertaiment .

In my opinion , Society has the responsability to catch the attention of this young people througt to differents ways that it has .
Here in Spain , goverment prepare special events for young people : Culture events focus in young people , goverments workers are helping in the schools in order to have more implicated young people , etc .
We have to create some essencial values in the young people in order to they understand the enviroment in which they are living .

But I sure that is not a great problem for the society , because people start the interest in the community when they need it .
I would liek to explain it with an example : If we take a young boy of a development country , we have to ask us : Which thinks need this boy from the community ?
Nothing .
He has a home , lovely parents , cable television , friends , video games , internet , etc ...
They do n't need anything from the community , so he is not going to colaborate with it .

This situation changes totally when young people start uppergrade studies or start in his first job .
They start the contact with the society .
Is in this moment , when young people understand that they are living with a lot of people and we have to talk , work , study , etc , with them in order to develop themself in their lives and in the society .

When young people reach this level , they want to start the colaboration with their communities .
