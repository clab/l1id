I disagree with the statement .
I believe that older people enjoy life much more than younger people do .
There are several reasons why , first of all is that older people have more experience and can have a better idea of what they really want out of life .
On the other hand , young peple tend to be undicided on what they want .

Second , older people knowing what they want , tend to be more appreciate of life since they probably have encountered hardships to get to the point where they can enjoy life .
With young people is the opposite .
They do not have the experience nor have faced as many hardships ( if any ) in life to realize how difficult life can be .

Moreover , older people have worked very hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life .
It is true that young people have more energy and probably are eager to enjoy life but older people have been waiting a long time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmensely when it arrives .
I recognize that older people are more skeptical and less likely to take risks compared with a younger person so the way of life an older person might live is less intense and thrilled with emotion but and older people can enjoy their way of life as much as any young person .

Thirdly , let us not forget that older people were once young people .
They can look back and judge wether they are enjoying life more at an older age than at a younger age .
They probably would come to the conclusion that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they survived and reached an older age .

Finally , older adults certainly are , phisically , older than younger adults , but they can be young adults in spirit .
They can enjoy life inmensely knowing that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come .
