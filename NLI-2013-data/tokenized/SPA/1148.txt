I do not fully agree with the statement that it is better to have a general knowledge over a specialized one .
I believe this matter actually depends on wich stage of his/her career a person is and which his/her ultimate goals in professional life are .

For starters , every person who initiates on a field of study should commence by assimilating the simple concepts ; for example , an Engineer , a person who is doing Mechanical Engineering and one who is studying Aeroespace Engineering will both study during the firsts semesters the basic courses of all the engineering carreers ; like : algebra , mathematics and physics .
There is no way a Mechanic can design a machine without understanding first the basic rules of physics .
But this should not stop here , once the basics are built more detailed work needs to follow to grow on knowledge .

On the other hand , to have only people with broad or not specialized knowledge could lead to less development on society , it is crucial for a culture to have individuals with a particular field of study , with focus in specific subjects that can result on efficient solutions to nowadays problems .
That is why for example we need to have oncologysts , who are doctors that after completing their basic medicine school went beyond it to study on a deeper way cancer and ways to treat and cure it .

Furthermore , if we take this subject again to the college environment , we will see that the concept of having first a broad knowledge to later specialize it is implied on the normal carreer path ; a person starts with a broad degree , lets say for example Industrial Engieneering , then after some good exposure to the work environment and experimenting with his/her preferences , that person will pick a subject for a Masters like Manufacturing , then after more knowledge and practical exposure have been accomplished it is possible to go through a PHD program which is even a more specialized vision of that particular path , in the case of our example Manufacture of Polymers research .

In Conlusion , I believe that the goal of every professional is to achieve certain level of mastery or specialization on the very subject that gives passion to his/her life ; but , to acomplish so , it is crucial to acquire basic knowledge first that will provide the foundation for this development .
