Have you ever noticed how young people enjoy their life and how older people do in this twenty first century ?
I agree that every person contains his/her own style of how to enjoy life .
It is not a matter of age .
Different stages of life bring different patterns of how to do it .
In this eassay I wil explain in a positive manner both how young and older people could live their own life regardless of age .

Firstly , young people usually love to enjoy their life intensently .
For example , once the turn 18 years old , which is the legal age in order for them to get indenpendent , they like to go out with their friends , and dance all night ( if it is possible ) .
In addition , they could get their driver license exam , by doing this they will be able to buy their own car , which also make them feel more independent .
Moreover , they may be healthy sufficient in order for them to join different type of sports , that really require to be in optimal health condition .

Secondly , older people have their unique way of enjoying their own life .
For instance , there is a certain age that an old person love to make some planns .
A 65 years old couples , will enjoy to be in a quite envirement while they are having a romatic dinner .
If they plann to celebrate every marriage anniversary , they will choose a restful hotel where they would not be disturbed by any type of noise .
On the other hand , a young person will look for another type of envirament .
Furthermore , older people will not have a good health condition , which will limit them to be more creative .
However they will still enjoy form several activities that do not require them to be that healthy .
For example , they could spend time swimming , playing golf , and playing cards .

In conclusion , I am strongly conviced that the age does not affect how people could enjoy their life .
There is multiple manners of how to do this .
Even though not every person has a healthy condition , there is always a way of how to enjoy a life .
