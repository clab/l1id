Long has been written whether young people enjoy life more than older people do , as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do .
Nevertheless , I consider that enjoying life has more to do with people 's attitude toward life than with them being young or old .
Therefore , I will try to describe some ideas in order to support that enjoying life has much more to do with an attitude than with age .

For example , many people could think that enjoying life may be related to lifetime , therefore if you are young person you could enjoy life more than if you are old .
Old people could think that young people have much more energy , or more activities in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them .
The only thing they do n't stop to think is that usually young people do n't have as much spare time as old people could have .

On the other side , many young people could possible think that old people enjoy life much more than them since they are retired and the could do whatever they want with their time .

As I have stated before , I definitely consider that enjoying life has more to do with waking up every morning feeling as if you need to do something , either walking , running , eating , sleeping , working , etc. and how you will manage to take the best part of the day .
No matter if you are young or old , if you have lots of things to do every day or no , the only point is the attitude you put to live every day in order to be able to enjoy it .

Finally , I could say that enjoying life is not related to age since both being young or old you can enjoy life as much as you want .
