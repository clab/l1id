Folowing the statement that `` the best way to travel is witha tour guide '' , I strongly disagree with the idea .
I think the idea of traveling with a guide takes all the charm and the adventure of the trip , also the guides are use to show only the most common tings on a tour , so many small and detailed things get out of context .
Additionally , the idea of a tour guide represent a timed and rushy tour .

Initially , the idea of a tour is to take adventures or to just enjoy the beauty of itself .
The idea of having a person telling you what to do or to read takes my idea of a tour in other direction .
I think a trip is meant to be enjoyed and as well to be shared with people you like .
Therefore , a guide would not only represent a person who you are not bind to but also someone who eventually will become a obstacle in your tour .
Then in order to enjor the charm of a trip is better to do it by oneself .

Next , guides are trained to take you to the places evreyone goes or are the most common places , so in order to see more new exitement on a trip , you have to take your own baton .
I remember the time I went to some islands in my country , where the guide always took us to places that every one sees on television or the museums .
However , when I left without the guide , I meet more people and discovered places that not even the guides know .

Finally , I think the biggest problems with guides is the time .
Because they have to cover an schedule , you have to move to their pace and you cannot admire what you want with your own time .
I think it is better to enjoy one single moment that visit hundreds without even taking a time to enjoy or relax .
I strongly believe that a person should n't be attached to time in a trip because it takes away the real meaning of a tour , relax .

To conclude , I think the best way to make a tour is to do it by themselves .
The big bussines of tour guides have destroy the beauty of the tours in many ways and finally make it unplesant on some occasions .
