When making reference to high school itself , it is much better to see a well-rounded transcript with Bs and As in every subject then to observe how a student had straight A+ in a certain subject , but failed in every other class .
The main point of academic subjects and school it to keep challenging yourself , never cieseing to strive for the best and never feeling satisfied with the least of what you can do .

Colleges are n't striving to recruit the A+ student that is n't committed to extra curricular activities , leadership and community service ; they 're searching for the `` well-rounded student '' .
Of course , if you can be a Honors student , athletic and president of the class at the same time , go right ahead !
But basically , everyone has to learn to do a little of everything to achieve success in life .
Being perfect at art crafts but pathetically stupid at mathematics wo n't allow you to succeed because you will need someone to do all you do n't know how to .
Once you think you 're perfect at a single subject , you must find a way to challenge yourself to improve in it as well .

Since the world has gotten so competitive over the past decades , knowing absolutely all there is to know about a single subject wo n't get you far in life because it is more important to be `` a well - rounded person '' than perfect at a single subject .
To impress someone you have to denote your overall cultural knowledge and not only your broad wisdom in history , for example .
To strive for the best , you have to know as much as possible from every academic subject .
In my experience , it has been impossible to be perfect at every subject naturally , but I find more satisfaction in constantly striving to do my best and being well-rounded in school .

An English teacher at school once told me `` it is not necessary to be , but to pretent to be '' .
When I first heard what he said I thought it was inmoral and an uneducated expectation of life .
Thinking about those words and referring to it by previuos experience though , I concluded that what he said was correct ; even though I did n't want him to be .
If you cannot find a way to be perfect in every academic subject you must pretend to be .
The way to `` pretend to be '' is to constantly rehearse on being the best , striving for the best and giving the best of your knowledge and will to that subject .
Soon , you will learn to love it , appreciate it , enjoy it and acknowledge important facts out of it .

In conclusion , is it better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject because that 's what life it all about : knowing a bit of everything to be able to survive in this competitive world .
Every person needs to know a bit about math , sciences , arts , literature and history in order to stand out in society .
Someone whos life only reflects mathematical achievements will lack the intelligence , or knowledge , to be able to fullfill the rest of the activities in his daily life .
