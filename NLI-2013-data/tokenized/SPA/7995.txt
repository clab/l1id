Travelling to a new place can be very exciting especially if done by group .
The best way to get to know a new place is by having the opinion of someone who knows what to show , but a tour guide can be very monotonous and tedious if you want to explore .

If you were to go in a group of people to a new city , travelling with a tour guide can be safe and interesting .
The guide can show you the local attractions such as a church , cathedral even a local bar , but it is way more fun if you go on your own , and experience the church maybe even pray a little ; go to the cathedral and look at the things that you want to look at and not what the guide wants to show you ; and get to a bar and sit and enjoy with the locals and not with the guide and the group who are usually in a hurry .

Another good reason for going on your own , is that you can always stop wherever you want and feel free to shop , visit , stop , eat , drink and do almost anything .
A guide will always tell you or induce you into what to do or what to look at .

If you were to plan a visit to your personal sightings , because there is a reason that motivated you to go to a certain place , you will do it in your own schedule , at your own time and rhythm .
Plan when and where you will eat .
When you 'll come back to your hotel and arrange your day according to your interests .
Meanwhile , the guide will look for the best schedule to do as much as possible in one day , try not to leave anything out , plan where and when you will eat , and most important look-out for the group 's interest which is not always your own .

Finally , a very important and problably exciting reason to go on your own and not with a guide , is that you can meet people in your visit and end up leaving with that person to visit other locations and getting to know the place through someone else 's eyes .
Or if you travel with your couple , it would be romantic to walk and visit together and not with a guide or the group .

As you can conclude , travelling by yourself to a new place is much better than with a guide .
It is personal , exciting , and most important , adequate to your best interests .
