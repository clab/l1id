I am deeply sorry to have to disagree with the statement , specially because my idea of a better world includes the reduction of private transportation in benefit of public transportation .
The truth is that I do n't see that happening anytime soon. : ( Let 's do the maths >

First of all , the degree of development that countries like China , India and others are achieving , will bring access to a huge portion of their citizens to private transportation .
Even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of cars that is currently using , that would make the difference .
So we can add some hundred of millions to the current number of cars ...

In the meanwhile , the population in developed countries keeps growing , what lead us to discard the idea of a possible reduction of vehicles on these developed countries .
So we keep adding some millions ..

The results of the research of alternative sources of energy , if possitive , will probably boost the car sales in the future .
Yes , we can still consider them '' cars '' even when they do n't run on gas anymore .
At that point , having a car will probably make more sense than ever .
The idea of making 500 miles for only 2 dollars sounds definitely very appealing .
Ttraffic jams could be the only reason to use public transportation by then .

Our cities will become more and more overpopulated and hard to move through , proving the use of public transportation as the most effective way to move around .
Yes , that probably will happen , but still we will probably like to have our own car in the garage to use it during the weekends .
We wo n't resign to that feeling of independece and of course the rest of member of our family wo n't do as well .
So my opinion is that the reduction in that respect wont be very significative .

All that said , My opinion is that the number of cars in 20 years will be higher than is now .
