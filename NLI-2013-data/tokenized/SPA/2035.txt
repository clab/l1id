In my point of view I completely disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
In my country , everyone enjoys life as much as possible and for them they do not care about their age .
For them age is just a number ; they think that the spirit that is within themselves is what matters .
So they enjoy their lives to its maximum in any period of time .
And so , do i .

Besides , everyone has many goals , and one of them is to enjoy life .
So no matter what age you are you can enjoy life .
For instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friends , now let 's see a old person having a vacation on the Bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she loves .
In my point of view , both people , the child and the old person are enjoying life , and i do not see why would one of them enjoy life more than the other .

As i said before everyone has a spirit and i personally do not think that the spirit get older as the days pass by .
Within one 's spirit there is energy .
Energy is what takes us from one place to another ; to eat or not to eat ; to do things or not to things ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life .
So then , if everyone has a spirit that means that they also have energy , therefore everyone has an equal amount of energy to enjoy life at any period of time .
To put in other words , age does not matter for someone to enjoy life .

In conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same .
It is true that when you get older the muscles start to be more flexible and solf and tends to break more easily than if you were young .
But muscles do not have anything to do with enjoying life .
It is also true that as you get older , your brains develops in different steps and so you can think more deeply about things that interest or bother you .
But does that affect whether you enjoy life more than others ? .
Well , in my opinion my answer would be no .
