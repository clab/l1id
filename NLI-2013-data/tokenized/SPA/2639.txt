I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do because young people want to discover the world , they usually have more energy than older people and they are not really worriend about the future .

Young people enjoy more their life simply because they do n't know a lot of things .
This is an extra motivation to enjoy almost anything that they go through .
More over , young people always want to taste by themselves everything that surrounds them and they will always try to discover new and exciting things .
Some things that probably older people wo n't do are for example do extreme sports , traveling around the world and so on .
This could happen because of a lack of energy by the older people .

Energy is really important to enjoy life .
Young people are usually full of energy because of their youthness , which is a disadvantage for older people who are usually tired of working and spend their free time recovering .
A lot of people would say that energy is not necessary to enjoy life and that could be true .
Another way to enjoy life is to get a relax time , but again young people can enjoy more this relaxed times because they are less tired than older people are .

Older people are usually busy with their jobs because they are worried about their future .
Although young people are also worried about their future , they will always be less worried on this kind of issues .
This less worried attitude lead us to think about a lack of resposability by young people .
But that 's what makes life more enjoyable .
Young people will always think they have a whole life towards them and that is a relief from some worries that older people usually have .

Every person can enjoy life to the maximun , but for sure young ones will enjoy it more because their path in life has just began and they still have a long road to go through it , which makes life more enjoyable and exciting .
