I agree that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
I support this statement for several reasons First of all there is the durability of the product in the market .
This means that if I can sell a product in a mass production way there is the need of lowering the cost of manufacturing in order to generate more money .
Which in turn means using bad quality products .
In return there is a significant investment in the marketing in order to be sold .
Another reason why products seem better in advertisment is because of technological advancements .
The use of several computer progrmas such as illustrator , photoshop and others have the possibilty of accenting in different ways the beauty of the product being advertised .
For example a macdonald commercial of a cheese burger , the size , the look of the ingredients everything is exagerated .
This also means being able to potray an unreal vision of what the product is .
Thirdly , competition , because the same product is sold by different parties the best visual statement made is the one that is going to sell the most , even though the product could be the same .

It is important to say that although this is a common marketing strategy people should be aware of this manipulation .
Specially by being well informed of the product being advertised in order to judge not only visually , the quality of the product .
A company decision to use advertisment exagertion to sell their product protrays a lack of respect towards the buyer .
And it is our responsability to regulate as buyers such manipulations
