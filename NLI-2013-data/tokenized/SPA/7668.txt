When one decides to travel , one might think on the purpose that this intended travel is to take .
When one travels on a leisure basis aspect it is up to the person itself to portray how he / she pictures such expriences to be covered .
For example , if one plans to travel and visit Ancient Rome , Ancient Greece , Egypt etc , one might evaluate the option of having a tour guide .
The tour guide , being a person that is familiar with such sorroundings will definitely take the person to visit and enjoy such famous landmarks that are worh traveling for .
One has a pre-organized schedule of those places to be visited , therefore making great use of time .
Everything is basically under control leaving time for excitement , satisfaction and fun .
Most of the time , tour guides help the person learn and enrich themselves personally with specific accounts on the place that is being visited .
It enriches one , not only educationally , but can also be plenty worth the time .

On the other hand , when one decides to travel without a tour guide , one might be seeking , action , adventure , curiosity .
On might intend to explore the sense of discovering things and places that has n't been seen before .
Then again it is up to the person to `` get out there '' and find the things that will make a trip worthwhile and exciting .
No one handles the travelers time except him/her .
They decide where to go , how to get there and when to go , making it then more intrinsic and inspirational when its time to make the best of it and of course make the memories long-lasting and cherishable .
So , when it comes to whether choosing or not a tour guide to accompany a traveler on its trip , it must depend on what the person seeks and strives to acknowledge , live and learn along the course of his / her exciting journey .
