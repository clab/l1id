The best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Some poeple think like that , and other onces think that is better travel with a group of poeple but without a tour guide .
I am agree with the first statement by some reasons .

First , you may have a good schedule of fun activities .
If you like to travel and if you are an organized person , you will like to have an schedule with all your activities , and also someone who show you the bests parts of the city , explain their history , the good and bad things , the meaning of the place , etc .
By following a schedule you may have all your time planned , and you can have the opportunity of visit a lot of parts .

In a second point , traveling in a group is very fun .
If you do not know any poeple , is a good opportunity to meet some friends , share experiences , know poeple of different parts of the world , understand different cultures and also you can practice a foreign language .

Finally , and no less important , you can save a lot of money by traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
All poeple know that travel on this times is very expensive , and if you travel in group , you will have some very good advantages like saving money in the hotel , or in your transportation .
So if you save money , you have the possibility of travel two or three times in a year , and that is really fantastic .

Like a conslusion , I can say that all poeple or the most of the poeple love to travel around the world .
Is very excited to think on having the opportunity of visit a lot of cities , meeting poeple of different cultures , even learn about history , and of course saving money .
That is why I think that the best way of travel is in group led by a tour guide .
