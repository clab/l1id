Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Life through decades has changed .
The situation of violence , growing in technology , and a fast-pace 's life has made individuals experiment other kind of activities that help them to make their lives better and less complex .

Many years ago people used to go out and talk about interesting things , such as political , economical , or even better , religious matters .
Young people talk about parties , cars , clothes and all the items that are in-fashion .
Political and economical aspects are not fun to talk about .
This , without mentioning that the background they have about these aspects is minimun .
What happens around the world , how the economy of the country is doing is not an issue to take care of .
The most important is to have money in their pockets and spend it as they want to .
Religion is not even in their heads .
God does not have the same importance in their lives as it used to be in old people 's life .
Where everything was lead by him .
It did not matter which religion was believed .
For the youth , God has been replaced by energy , tarot , or even worse luck .

When old people had parties , drugs and promiscuity was not seing .
Nobody thought about hurting others .
Now a days , these are the essential elements to say that a party was awesome .

In summary and having mentioned just a couple of differences in humans ' life through time , it is not easy to say if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I bet old people had fun talking about situations that concerned humanity .
It is just a matter of how you perceive life , the type of education that has been implemented at home , and what you want for your future .
