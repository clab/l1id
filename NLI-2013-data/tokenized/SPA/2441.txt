Young people might someties be more able to enjoy life than older people because young people have a very important thing in life that unfortunatly elder people do not have ; health .

Young people are normally more capable of doing activities or things to enjoy themselves more because they do not have to deal with as many problems as older people have to deal with .
The stress that older people have to deal with in their life might lead them not to enjoy life as much they want to .
My father once told me something I am never going to forget .
He said that when you are young you have the health and the time to enjoy life but you did not have the money to do so .
And that one had to work hard to earn money , which might cause us not to enjoy life as much .
Then when you are older , between forty and fifty , you had normally made more money , you were still healthy but you no longer had time to do anything to enjoy life as we are supposed to .
Later , when you are old , you had all the money you are going to have and you had all the time in the world , but you no longer had health to enjoy life and have fun .

To my opinion , one has to be able to find the perfect balance between when you are young , older and old .
One has to be able to achieve happiness when you are young by doing things that do not involve to much money .
Later , you have to make sure you are leaving enought time for things such as traveling and family to be able to appreciate life .
And when you are finally old and are normally no longer healthy , you have to be able to enjoy life with what you have left , such as family and friends .
