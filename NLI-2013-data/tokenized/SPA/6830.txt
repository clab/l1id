Evaluating on the topic question i agree with the statement .
I belive that the government and the people have started acting on this issue already .
Combustion is one of the main problems causing global warming the headlines which read that London will be under water in 60 years if we do not act soon , are terrifying people .
Hydrogen buses and cars are being built but still people are being convinced to take public transport .
As the years progress and global warming gets worse people will start to realise what is happening in the past people did not really act upon what was being said because they knew that it was not going to affect them , but it has come to a time were it will affect our generation wether we like it or not and as soon as people start realising that , then they will start doing something about it .
Big cars will be banned from major cities and families will be forced to own only one car .
The amount and size of cars today is ridiculous there is no more parking anywere and soon there will be no more petrol available to us .
Making it more expenisve to fill up your car so people will take more public transport .
Our world has changed enormously and people now have jobs away from home making the families own two or more cars .
Even though it is our world at stake .
London is working on banning land rover 's today as we speak they apparently take up to much space and parking , the process will carry on limiting people to only fundamental transport .
People are starting to realise what a mess of the world we have made , and the changes occuring around us such as the Maldives going under water or natural disasters such as the Tsunami are all effects of what we are doing to the planet and people are slowly realising what has got to be done .
Fewer cars will also hopefully make people use the most of what is around them such as holidays in their own countries and therefore will also lower the use of other big means of transport such as airplanes and boats which as well as cars are polluting the environment .
