I agree that with a tour guide is the best way to travel because if a group of persons are visiting a place that never been there will be in less risk of having a bad incident and also will visit the most important places of the area .

The guide will have the time planned helping in maximamizing the time during each visit .
This gives the opportunity to the visitors to visit all the places that was planned in the tour .
They will simplify the everyday logistic of moving from one place to another

With the tour guide the group are not exposed to places that may be dangerous to them , because they now the area very well .
Tour guide also will help in explaning the history of the place because they are there for that , to give a better understanding to the visitors of the visited place .

If something happens in the area of visiting the guide know how to overcome or avoid a potential problem to the group .
For example visiting a coutry that have a different language , the guide tour can understand what is going on in the area and avoid potential harmful to the group .

The guide know the route to visit each place avoiding delay or waste of time in traffic .
People can have a brief of the place before getting to it , helping these the visitor to prepared such as appropiate dressing .

Definetly the guide is very impotant from my point of view because help in making easier the visit to an area .
Also , visitor can get much more information from the visited places in comparison is they go and visited by itself .
I recomend that does not matter which place peolple go it is better to be with a guide in a place that you do not know .
