Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This a commonly held view , but not necessarily a correct one .
Throughout the years , there has been an immense gap created between the young and the old ; emphasized by literature and the media .
However it has not been an accurate representation of life itself .
Even though it is true that younger individuals do hold substantial differences when compared to older ones , different is not a synonym of better or worse .
That is why youngsters do not enjoy life more than older people do , as they simply hold different interests , values , and priorities .

One of the factors that diferentiates the different generations the most is interests .
Younger people tend to be more interested in the new trends , and even follow the current styles in regards to fashion , music , and entertainment .
Older individuals on the other hand , tend to hold on the past , and to be more interested in trends of their younger years .
This difference , however , does not mean that younger individuals can enjoy life to a greater extent , it simply means that some areas , such as personal interests tend to vary with the pass of time .

Another factor that marks a difference between younger and older people , are values .
Younger people seem to live in the moment , and sometimes even avoid the future .
Their values have a tendency to be similar to those of the people of thier generation ; things such as friends , or an education .
However , older people seem to plan ahead much more , and tend to hold the values and morals of thier earlier years .
Values start to modify with th pass of time , and start to modernize .
That is why older people hold more conservative values in comparison to the younger generations .
However , enjoying life has nothing to do with morals , but rather on an individual 's personal level , and that is why it does not mean that older people are lacking a love for life .

Finally , th last factor that differentiates the younger from the older are priorities .
Older people have many more responsabilities , since they have to take care of entire families , and even provide a stable income .
Younger people on the other hand have other priorities , such as completing a proper education , and planning ahead for their future .
It is clear that both parties have apparent differences , mainly because of the coming of age , however it does not mean that younger people enjoy life to a greater extent .

Every individual is different , and they each have thier ways of viewing life .
Most older people tend to have similar outlooks , as younger people do as well .
However , this does not mean that one knows how to enjoy life better than the other , or that one has the right recipe to happiness .
They are merely apparent differences that highlight the diversity that the world possessess .
Because enjoying life varies from person to person , and what might be the correct manner in which to seize life for one individual , might not necessarily work for the next .
