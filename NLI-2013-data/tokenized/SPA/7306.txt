People its accustumed to travel with a big group and nothing is better than going with a tour guide for achive that .

In my personal opinion its depending to the place you go the desicion you may choose .
personaly i like the most traveling alone because it gives me a feeling of freedom that isnt in anywhere .
Id also like that because its the only way to stay alone with nature and with my oun feelings and thoughts .
Eventhough , it is important to recognized that going to a touristic place alone is not some much funny : you will may not dance with anybody , or you may not get out of the hotel .
on those trips im so agree with that statement .
going whith people makes you meet people , known other personalities , and the most important .
share with those who sharing that life experience with you .

in the other hand , a tour guide give you the oportunity of a payment facility .
you also have the security that those organizations give to you , even when you have to pay a little bit more .
when you are alone you chalenge with more problems , you have to respond for anything , so , as good it is it , is the responsability you assume .

finally i can said that in my opinion both options are valid depending on your point of view .
mine is clear : i prefere even all the responsability traveling by own way and my own preferences .
