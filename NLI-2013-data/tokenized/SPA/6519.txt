Imagins that you have to work far from your house and you should take a way of transportation , on one hand you have a confortable car and , on the other hand you have an unconfortable public transportation that is going to take too long to get to the place that you like ...
what kind of transportation do you prefer ?
You do n't need to answer ..

In twenty years , I do n't belive that the current situation is going to change .
First of all , people need to move from one place to another and also , eveyone likes to be independent , and that is n't goint to change in twenty years .
In fact , we need cars for everything .

Cars give people a social status , depending of the brand of the car that you have you are in a different social class and everyboy needs to be in a group .

Ono the other hand , due to enviroment problems , people could stop using cars in order to reduce CO2 pollution .
Perhaps , another reason why could be less car in twenty years could be the extintion of fossil sources , such as oil and gas .
In that case , scientis will invent new sources of energy to use in car instead of oil or gas .

Maybe scientis can find better ways of transportation , but , in only twenty years I beflieve that it is impossible .
In conclusion , I think wo n't be fewer car in use , because car are like a part of our body that we need to move and not only that , also we live in a period in which everybody wants to get the much as they can , and if you can have more than one car , that 's better .
These kind of behaivours are n't going to change in twenty years , thus the number of cars will be increasing year by year
