Definitely , I see many reasons that allow me to think , not only that in the near future cars will be fewer , but also that that scenario is desirable to improve the qualifity of peopl'es life and the wealth of our environment .

On the one hand it is plausible to think that the use of the automobils , particularly those that function with gas , will decreased during the near future , due to the evidence of a direct lingk of its usage and a permanent damge in our evironment .
In fact the pollution of the latter is drawing the attention of may ecologists and political activists , clearly awared of the terrible consequences if a sustainable development is not undertaken .

In adddition , the usage of more cars in cities seems to be very inconvenient if we acknowledge that urban places are becoming increasingly overcrowded , mainly becouse of the flow of migration , either within countries , from population abbondoning their countryside towns and heading to the big cities , either from people leaving their own countries , seeking for new opportunities .

Cars could hinder the possibility of a rapid movement throughout the city , creating traffic jams , thus , extending the time people need to commute from one place to other .
Moreoever , since cities , particularly in Europe , characterized from their high population density and their lack of space and , the costs of parking lots is unaffordable for the majority of the population .
Therefore even car owners decide to restrict the usage of their vehicles , to weekends or to go out at night , avoiding commuting by automobiles on a daily basis .

Another factor that should be taken for consideration , regarding the inconveniences of cars massive use is the cost of gas .
In other words , it is a lot cheaper to use the public transportation system than to use a car .

Finally , the reasons to rtestrict the use of the car outnumber the reasons to use it .
Therefore I strongluy believe that their number will decrease /
