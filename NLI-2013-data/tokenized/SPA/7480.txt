Based on my experience I disagree with the statement .
From my point of view organized tour trips are more expensive , they lack of flexibility in order to arrange unexpected activities , and they loose the emotion of travelling to a different country and discover the real life and culture , two aspects you can not find out in the touristic scheduled tours .

I have travelled twice with an organized tour guide .
In both ocassions the trip cost me much more than if I had organized it by myself .
It is true that you can get very good group discounts , however the hotels they take you are more expensive than the ones you can find by yourself for example in a guide book like ` Lonely Planet ' , through internet or friends references .

The lack of flexibily in a tour guide is another reason that made me organize the trips by myself .
Organizing the trip by yourself , you can customized your routes , visiting only those places you are really interested in , without having to visit every single place the guide believes as interesting .

Finally and for me the most important reason , it is the discovery of the country 's culture .
Normally , the tour guide trip follows a route which takes the tourist to the most touristic places in the country , places plenty of foreigners and few local people .
Travelling alone , you can can decide to visit totally unknown places for foreigner where you can speak in a natural way with the locals , learning how the really live in a dailybasis .

As I mentioned before my experienced made me organized trips by myself instead of hiring tour guides trips .
My economy , the flexibility of customize my routes and my interest for other cultures made me choose these trips as the best way to seize and enjoy a trip abroad
