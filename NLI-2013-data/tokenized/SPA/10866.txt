I have always been a person that pushes herself to be a better individual .
Always looking forward to become a succesful student and profesional .
In order to become a succesful person it is important to be brave and being open to new experiences .
By doing that , these experinces will help to improve your knowledge and increases your point of view towards life .
Being succesful is in fact a very difficult thing to achieve if you are a person that is not willing to take risks .
Everything in life is at risk and by saying that just living life is a risk .
However , not too many people can take advantage of what life offers you in the long path .

I have always thought that when you do n't take risks you do n't go that far away .
Probably it is easy to say but really hard to make it possible .
Right now , I am in a stage in my life where I am taking the biggest risk .
I want to graduate from a graduate school in the United States and become a professional and licenced architect .
It is going to be a very big change in my life being away from my family for the first time .
It will become the biggest step in my life but the only important thing that is keeping me strong is having my confidence up high always thinking that everything will be fine as long as I work and try my hardest in everything I propose in life .

It is the most ambigous feeling in the world , having so much exciment to go but at he same time fear of what will be going to happen after I go .
In my opinion that 's the beauty of taking risks .
You have to exposed yourself to the world in order to exchange and obtain knwoledge so that you can share it with pride and pleasure to others .
The best of all is the feeling that you probably are going to have when you look back and see how brave you were and how stronger you became after taking that risks .
