A lot of people want to be successful , and they try to succeed in different ways .
Some people prefer to take risks and try new things , while others prefer to succeed by doing things that they master .
I always succeed because I do things that I do well .
I do n't like to feel the uncertainty of doing something new , I do n't like to make mistakes , and I do n't like to waste my money .

Primarily , when I do something new , I do not know what is going to be the result .
I feel better when I have the certainty of the things , and I always succeed .
I need to turn unknown things into known things because I will have more probability to do better things in my life .

I have been successful all my life because I always try to master the performance of many activities in my daily life .
Secondarily , doing new things inplies many mistakes because people have to try many times in order to improve their performance .
When people make mistakes often , they can lose credibility with other people .
If other people are observing me , I try to perform better my activities .
Finally , trying new things offers the invovenience of spending a lot of money .
Each effort has a high cost because the possibility of failure is great when I do new things .
Experiencing with new trhings requires either new material and equipment or more people .
All these resources are very expensive .
Therefore , I prefer to save money and do things that I do well .

Successful people do things in a different manner .
While some of them try to do somethiong new , others do thigs that they do well .
I do not like to take risks in my life , so I try to do things well all the time .
Taking riks is insecure , risky , and expensive .
