During the past decades , the introduction of a new marketing idea to increase the sells of a specific product were seeing in many parts of the world , this idea were the `` Advertisements '' .

As the question states , I stronly support the idea that products seems much better in their advertisments than they are truly are once you bought the product .
This can be easily found in all the health or beauty products that you can found in every corner of the entire planet .
By having an advertisment on T.V. it shows to the public not only the introduction of a new product but it also shows the `` advantages '' of using that product with the minimum aspect of having the desire result in a long period of time and | or using more than one time .
This is most likely the effect they have on a population .
Another important aspect that support the idea of looking a product which seems much better than it usually is , is by hiring well-known personalities in different areas of the entertainment market , examples of this can be identified by using a 24 year model using a product that will reduce the number of scars in her backside , or using a football player drinking a new product that will increase his perfomance during a sport activity .

Although it is important to notice these aspects , there is also important to focus on the new recently developed ideas that companies are trying to use these days and it is proving quite succesufull , this is the use of common people that resemble or is trying to be identified the real needs of the people , one example is having fast-food products that you can eat and enjoy while you are eating if you do not have time for have a proper breakfast or your time is reduced because of your work .
However , every product we see had a marketing process before the product was totaly aproved and was showed to the `` future '' buyers by imposing a much better idea that displays in an advertisments than they are really are , but it is also important to have a balance and try to satisfy the some needs of the buyer , because by not fullfulling this aspect , the company will more likely starts to loose customers , so they have to keep that in mind by not showing a product that will `` possible '' deliver to the customers a fill some of their needs in order to prevail the product as well the reputation of the company .
