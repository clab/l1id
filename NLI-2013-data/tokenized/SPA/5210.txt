In a highly competitive market , more and more companies are finding difficult to develop new ways of selling their products .
One of the most effective way has been advertising in all its layouts .
However , although the efficiency of advertising has been proved over the past of the years , it has also been a very controversial practise because it does not always present the products as they are in reality .
That is the reason that explain why thousands of customers complain about the products they buy every year .

I agree with this statement becasue I believe that the bulk of ads that surrounds us daily does not give us an accurately description and image of the product we are going to buy .
This phenomenon happens frecuently at Christmas .
During these days , a lot of parents buy gifts for their children and they follow what they see on advertisements either on tv or in the newspapers .
However , when children open their presents they are not only the ones that are dissapointed , because their parents are also surprised that the product is not as they thought in the beginning .

The point here is that advertisements present products in a very attractive way and they manipulate the image in order to make it appealing for potential customers .
However , what happens is that the final product is not as good as it was presented or even it has some negative aspects that were hidden in the ad .

Most companies outsource their advertising campaigns to others highly-specialized in advertising .
These ones produce a creative campaign of advertising that introduces a new product or new aspects of an old one in our society .
With this practice , companies are achieving to sell their products pretty easy and they are obtaining huge amounts of profits .

This advertising trend is just focused in the short-term consequences for a company .
However , in the long-term , when a company advertises its products in a different way of what they are in reality , it may be losing customers and potential customers in the future because they see that the company is not saying the truth about its products .
The last consequence of this practise is that a company will lose its position in the market and then all its profitability .
