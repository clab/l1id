Idea Over Fact

The concepts and ideas that are essential in the learning procees of any academic proffesion have to understand , and not memorized .
The learning process implies a thought , ration , and analysis ; all of them essential in the absorption of information into our brains .
I agree with this statement because the understanding of all those concepts will beter prepare me in my proffesion .

I believe that the facts come as a direct result of the concepts and ideas that are learned in the academic prepation for a career .
We would not have facts if it was not for especific sciences like mathematics , chemistry , and physics .
A fact is only a series of numbers of a certain event or people .
That are thrown by the person that does the recolection process of information to do statistics .
With out the process of understanding the concepts and ideas of a science we would not be able to create facts .
For example we could be able to count or do statistics without mathematics .

Another perspective of facts is that we do not know if the facts are true or not ; the facts can be manipulated by personal or monetary interest .
For example a pharmaceutical company may manipulate facts of a certain disease - to increase sales of the medicine that cures that particular disease - to create a highers revenues on the financial statements .

I am not saying that facts are not important .
I use facts all the time in my profession and job .
But , we do not have to make facts the foundation of our knowledge in this world .
A fact when it is given as an honestly , errorless , and doubtless source , it wil automatically become a most useful tool in our day-to-day life .
The better understanding of ideas and concepts will make better facts and staticstics in the near future .
