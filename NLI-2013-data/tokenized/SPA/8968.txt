The understanding of both ideas and contents are important .
There is therefore , a slight difference for me that makes one more important than the other .

First of all when we learn about facts , whe are using our memory to get some info on somethig that works , exists and does not require any further experiments or resaerches .

On the other hand , when students learn concepts and ideas , they may put them together with the pourpose of conducting some researches .

When students are curious and have enough information , concepts and ideas ; the results of their experimets could lead them to get some facts by themselves .

Thomas Edison for example did not have the fact about what light represented , he had lots of ideas and concepts as the result of his various researches .
He was curious enogh to be able to put all these factors together ( Curiosity , ideas , concepts ) to be able to make a wonderful , revolutionaty invention .
An invention that created many everlasting facts .

All the modern and the new school methods zero in on leading the student to the learning through his ideas and the curiosity these may generate on him .

Nowadays , I have also have the chance to test myself and put into practice all these methods .
I am a person who likes learning through experiences and getting plenty of information by myself .

Achieving facts , or learning about facts on my own is important for me , but needless to say that all the existing facts you may learn about also give us abundant richness of concepts , ideas and kwoledge .

In short , ideas , concepts and facts are all necessary , but what really makes the difference is how effective well - structured concepts can lead a student to a more self-exploratory environment .

Thank you .
