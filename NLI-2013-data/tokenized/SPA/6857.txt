From my personal point of view this matter is a very hard issue to agree or disagree with .
Because we can not predict the future .

I think that cars are something that cause a lot of problems nowadays .
For example , in big cities such as : Madrid .
Paris , London or New York the traffic is horrible and this causes a lot of problems .
People are late most of the times because of traffic , have a lot of problems , such as , accidents because of traffic , some people even have bad temper because of the traffic jams .
And all of this is caused because we have too many cars on the streets .

I know that having your own car has a lot of advantages .
Because if you have your own car you can go wherever you want and whenever you feel like it .
But in my opinion people should not be so selfish and think in all the disadvantages .
For example I think that cars cause a lot of pollution that damage our enviorment and damage our health too !

I can not agree with this statement , at least at this point .
Because I think that people is very lazy and preffer spending their money in a car than spendig it on public transportation .

People preffer doing this for many different reasons not only because they are lazy , I think that public transportation is not good enough to trust in it one-hundred per cent .
Becuase public transportation sometimes has a lot of problems : ( it breaks down , or it delays ...
etc )
I think if public transportation improves within twenty years we might have less cars on the streets than now .
But is that posible ?
I do not think so .

In conclusion I do not agree with this statement for all this reasons .
