Some people enjoy life and some other people do not , may because they dont want to or just they do not feel it .

In my case I am young woman and in me experience I can say that for me this statement it is true , Is true because .
For example , I am the older sister in my family and i can see to many things about what my father and mather that are older than me likes to do .
I do many things different , of course , for the difference of age like go a party every two weeks or a concert once a week , and olso maybe go to the movies with me friends or just make noise , but what they do is not that similar , they like to stay in home reading , watching movies or news and some time spending time with the family .
In some occationes I can understand this kind of behavior , and is because they are tired after woks and that , but some times even if they stay all day at home , they would do the sema things during the day .

Some people thinks that each person have their own way to enjoy their own life , because it depents on the way of see the things or activities that you are doing , but for me is not in that way , i need to do things that make me feel that i am enjoying my life and the people would see and realise that IThat 's why I agree wiht this statement .
I really prefer to spend my time doing things more things that older people , I think that I enjoy life more that older people or better that that
