First of all , there is one important thing I think I should point out : My opinion on that issue depends deeply in the meaning one give to the word `` success '' .
What 's the real meaning of it ?
I suposse it would be a good task to discuss , because there is no doubt that this is an ambigue concept .

For me , success has a lot to do with having an idea or a goal and working as hard as neccesary to reach it .
We can learn a lot about History , and History tells us that from the beginning of the times people whose names and lives are nowadays known had been those who in any way tried to do something different and were brave enough to continue until the end .

I supposse it is no the easier way to live when you decide to break the rules , to take risks , to struggle with difficulties around you and not give up even when your closest friends or familiy lost their faith in you .
Because most of the times , succesful people suffered incomprenhension from their contemporaries , at least in any moment of their lives .

Because of all these reasons , I can affirm I completely agree with this statement
