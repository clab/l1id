Success depends on how how you picture it , that depends on how the person feels with their own lives .
I really think that taking risks will lead you into a successful pathway , because you will find a new way of picturing things , also more acertiveness and a pretty happy life .

First , having a Perfect career is not an easy thing .
So you had a previous plan , but nothing result as you originally have planned , but suddenly you have found a bright idea , it was about finding the same career that you want it so bad but with other ways that you can go through that , so many succesful people never have a closed mind .
They are open minded and have positive ideas about changes in life .

Other thing which is pretty important to succeed in life is acertiveness .
People always make a desicion in some part of their lives .
And sometimes they think that one tiny mistake or errors , will be crucial on their lives .
Such as Doctors who have to deal everyday with the right diagnosis and treatment of their patients , another example would be if you marry someone , moreover , when you pick your favorite music and food , and so on .
Making desicion is pretty important .

Finally , If you become a successful person , you will enjoy your life as much as possible , Life is beautiful in many ways , we have to know how and when to use the right tools .
What i strongly believe in taking risks will give you an opportunity to change and there is actually a saying in Venezuela `` El que no arriesga , no gana '' that means , `` The one that do n't risk , wo n't win '' .

In summary , Success is interpreted as many ways as possible .
There are many ways that can lead us to the right door of life , but that only depends on How you want it to happen , and how you can choose between two possible answer and how you conceive the word of happiness .
