Although a good basic and broad academic background is essential for any student in order to develop an understanding about his world and culture , gaining some specific experience and knowledge is the only way to make a student distinguish from others .
Based on the hard experience I am facing now while trying to find a job after completing my degree , I support the idea of speacializing and becoming unique .

During the last years , the number of students who after School enters an University in my country has amazingly increased .
Speaking about School education , I could choose among different fields of study .
I focused on a more cientific and tecnological one , what helped me to pass the access exam I needed in order to get the Computer Science degree I am holding now .

Once at the University , the firts courses should be mainly oriented in offering more general and broad subjects .
In such a way , the students will have enough information to choose their major or future professional orientation .
But as the education advances , the content of the subjects should be divided into specific branches .
By electing specific subjects and labs , I got valuable knowledge and training that makes a difference between my colleagues when the time to get a job has come .

Having more specialized employees also benefits companies .
It reduces competence and companies spend less money in the selection process .
Employees do not suffer so much during the hard interviews and feel more comfortable and sure about what the company expects from them .
As an example , I only send my resume to those companies whose job offers fit me .
Both the company and I are saving time and money .

To recap , specializing students and making them valuable for specific tasks , should help them in the future to find a position in a company where they will feel usefull and suitable .
