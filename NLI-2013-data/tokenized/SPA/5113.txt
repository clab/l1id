Avertisement is a topic involved with marketing , and marketing is about creating long term relationship with customers .
Before focusing in advertisements , a company has to create a marketing plan of how to reach the target market .
If the marketing plan of a company is effective , the need for advertisement is not as big as the need of a company that has a bad marketing plan .
Why do I involve marketing with the purpose of advertisement ?
Well , because a problem is only solved when the roots of the problems are known .

When a company has a good marketing plan , that company will not have trouble reaching their target market and obtaining profits .
Starbucks is a great example .
This company developed an excellent marketing plan according to their values and their objectives .
Starbucks has reached all their objectives and without the need to use advertisement .
They do not need to tell the people how good their product is because the people already know it .
This example leads me to explain if I agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''

I do agree with the statement because advertisements will be used only if the product or service needs it .
A commercial for example will make products and services look better than they really are because that product or service needs the consumer 's attention .
Of course I only agree with the statement because at the beginning of it , it says `` most '' .
If the statement would not have that word , I would not agree at all .
The reason I would disagree is because there are companies like MacDonalds that do not need the advertisements to sell their products , but they use them because the competition is huge , and they need their consumers to confirm why they are the best .

Advertisements are only use to catch the consumers attention , but it does not mean that the product or service will be exactly as is shown .
A person will only let himself believe everything he sees and hears if that person does not know why the advertisement exists in the first place .
Companies would do anything that is necessary in order to sell their product or service .
In a few words , most companies would do anything to be successful and make profits .
