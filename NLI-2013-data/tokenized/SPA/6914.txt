I think that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years because of several reasons .

First of all , there is a growing environmental awareness that is going to drive the decrease in car usage .
People are increasingly aware that current pollution levels and even oil resources are not sustainable in the long term .
Even nowadays there are examples of city majors banning the entrance of cars to certain areas in order to protect them , and this could well be a growing trend looking forward .
An efficient technological alternative to oil has to be found but until this outbreak occurs , governments would have to find a solution to make the best possible use of the limited oil resources .
Therefore , a possible solution would be to encourage the use of public transportation while disencouraging the use of cars ( taxes , fees to enter certain city areas , increasing parking fees , etc . )

In addition to environmental awareness , I think that people would actually end up finding public transportation a better way to move around than cars .
This would obviously need a general improvement of public transportation , but it seems quite reasonable that this improvement will occur with the government aligned in a drive to restrict car usage .
Once public transportation is improved , people will without any doubt choose it because of two resons .
Firstly , people like to travel in the fastest and safest way .
Public transportation will be a safer way of moving around than cars , and it woul even be faster , as it could avoid traffic jams .
In the second place , public transportatio will prove to be more cost and time effective .
People will be able to save a significant amount of money while travelling in a more time-effective way , as not only will they get to their destinations in less time but they will also be able to read or even work while they are travelling .
