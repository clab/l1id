I agree , all students have to understand ideas and concetps , because it is one way to learn about a topic , and it is easier for them to focus and memorize .
They will know the concepts in their world , and they are going to be able to put in practice .

I think it is going to be difficult to forget , becuase if the concepts is easier to memorize , they will practice evey day .
and it is going to realize evey day .

For example .

When you want to learn something , the firs step is to take a book or a dictionary , and you find out a world , at he beging , it is to be difficult but they want to undertand the meaning .

Another way , it is when start going to the school , the teacher write a concepts on the board , and they explain to the student , in their word , besides they use a pictures or draw .
All teachers are trying to explain the meaning and the goal for the teachers is going to be , when they know everybody in the class understood .

At the end of the semester , they are able to past the exam , and they are goint to get good grades .

At the end I think to know and understan the ideas it is going to be heplfull , in my experiecia , it helps in my carreear , At the begining of the university you have to memorize a lot concepst , the only way you can do that
