A travel is a exellent oportunity to know new cultures and to share with them and learn new things but at the same time is an exellent opportunity to rest and get fun and divertion .
we can say that there are diferents kinds of travels for example when yo want to travel with ypour family to know new things in this case the best thing taht you can do is travel in a big group let by a tour guide , becasue a tour guide is a person that know very well the place and he is going to carry you to the best places .
but if the objective of your travel is to rest you may go to paradisiatic place with wonderful landscapes , where you are far to the all the peop [ le that can interrup tour rest , in this case you do not need a tour guide because you are the only person that know what yon want to do and palce you want to go .

in my personal case without import wich is the objective of my travel , I do not like to travel in with a tour guide , because for me a travel is a moment to enjoy with the people that you want and I am sure taht a tour guide is not always a great person .
for thi the best travel for is atrvel with a schedule but without nobody taht say what do you have to do , is tpo said travel without a travel guide .
altough for me is important to have someone that in the palce of my travel can help me if I need somethin of if need help , but ths person has to be only for the moments that I need or I want is to say not a toor guide .

In conclution depending the travel that you do you may need differents things like a toor guide but in my case without import if a ravel in group or alone I do not like to travel with a tour guide .
