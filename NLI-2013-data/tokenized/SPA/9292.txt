Learning and understanding are two cognitive abilities that are closely related and are part of the every day experience of a human being .

I would say that , since students are constantly interacting with their environment and with others , learning from these experiences come as the main factor .
This ability could be defined as the disposition of the student to process information he receives from his environment , through his senses ( what he sees , listens and feels ) and is capable to categorize and keep this information for adaptional purposes .
Each information is contained in what we commonly call : experiences .

And by experiences I mean facts .
Facts are part of reality , part of the outside world , and helps a student understand a world that should be articulated with his internal experiences ( such as thoughts , and emotions ) .
Moreover , become socially adaptive and in coherence with his own thoughts about how the world works and how will he explain to himself the actions and reactions of his enviroment ; including natural scenarios , people and the diversity of this interactions , which are all part of the process of learning .

Understanding becomes an ability where the student considers what of all that he has learned is comprehensible enough for him .
That is , if he distinguishes significantlly between events and parts of reality .

For example , a new subject ( chemistry , to mention one ) is being taught to a student , first he receives all the information about it , theories , authors , investigations , etc ; but right after he has , lets say , accumulate all this information in his mind , after he has learned about this new subject , he will begin to comprehend , understand it , by re-reading books , articles , by talking and expressing his ideas , by reproducing the author 's point of view , etc .

Therefore , I do n't agree with the statement .
I consider that facing the oustide world is first and it is a process of learning ; understanding is that second part of the process on where the student ( or human being ) will form in his mind ideas , concepts , opinions , even hypothesis about what he has already learned .
So learning and understanding are in the same level of importance .

It is a matter of what comes first and how they influence the interaction between the student 's innerworld and reality placed outside .
