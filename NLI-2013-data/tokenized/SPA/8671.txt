Generally for all the students its very important to understand a lot of things .
It can be inferred that are a lot of ways of how a student can understand , that are learning from ideas and concepts , or understand by facts .

There are a lot of disadvantages of the three kind of situations already mentioned .
For example understanding by ideas it means that they do n't have the main experience to make straight the definiton and it 's more usually , difficult to understand it by this way .
For the other hand students can also understand by concepts , this means that the students are going to learn from a definition , something more concret .
And also there is another way of how a student can learn , and this way is understanding by facts , it means that the student is not going to learn a concept or have the main idea , it 's that the student is going to experience and learn from something that he lived .

These types of how a student can understand things can be something unclearness , but it doe n't mean that each student use the three options to learn something , but eventhough there are some of them who really uses the three .
For the other hand there a some students that only prefer one option , because they think that its the best way for them to understand things .

For my conclution I would say that it 's more important to all the students learn by facts , because it 's not the same thing to say that each person understood by reading and having the main concept of things , or that having just the idea .
Also , I think that it would be more clearfull to understand things by facts , because the students will not only get a good understanding , they also are going experience about a lot of things and that is going to be somenthing usefull for their life .
