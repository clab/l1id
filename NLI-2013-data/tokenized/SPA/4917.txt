I completely agree that most advertisementes make products seem much better than they really are .
I guess this has become a common way of plubicity to all kind of products .
Commonly the publicity agentes are ordered to make the products look better in order to make the client obtain a lot more costumers .
This publicity agents use a lot of technics to make the products look better , for example they use especialized software like photoshop to increase the size of the product or make it brighter , or maybe an artificial imitation of the product that not necesarly have same texture of look .

Eventhough one can observe this situation mostly on food products .
The Fast Food has become a product that often make advertisementes that make food look a lot of more better than they really are .
For example the big chain of fast food restaurants often show some pictures of each of the products they offer so the person can make his/her choice by observing the picture .
When the food is delivered to the costumer he/she notice that the appereance of the real product is not even close to that one shown in the picture , for example , the person can get a smaller hamburguer or maybe a different type of bread in a sandwich .

More over the fast food , this situation has been increasing in all types of products like tooth paste , detergent or even cloth or shoes .
Sometimes when a person sees an advertisement comercialising shoes , they commonly look softer and more confortable than they really are , when the person gets into the shop and fit them often notice that the shoes were not as good as they look on televison .

This certainly is a problem that is sourrounding us and overall is making people lose a lot of time .
I think there should exist some kind of reagulation that could control the content of the advertisements , so people always can receive what they are looking , in that way there would be less problems of reclamations , and it will be reflected in the reputation of the companys .
