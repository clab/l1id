Many expertises in the managment field have declared that the people we used to look up have that quality of trying new thigs and exprees opinions that could have other directions that most of the regular people would think .

I agree with this statement because history has showed us that the success , in any field of the human behavior , reach those who dare to go against `` regular costumes '' .
For example , everybody thougt that Christopher Columbus was insane when he expressed his idea of an espherical planet .
`` The earth is plane '' , this was the general thougth and evrybody laughted at him when Columbus decided to proved them wrong .
We already know what happened after he got the support of Queen of Spain .
Probably , he died not knowing that his madnees wolud lead and prove a revolutionary theory about our planet .

JesusChrist , the most amazin man ever lived , is the real proof that revolutionary thougts would lead the society to evaluate its behevior and change their costumes .
After 2.000 years , his learnings has effected every society in the world .

Albert Einstein , known physician and called `` Father of modern physics '' .
With his Relativity Theory , Einstein explained the behavior and the reason for every phenomenom that ocurrs in the nature , he took part in major researches around the world , and his theories are subject of investigation now in these days .
He was a lonely man , and probably was consider as `` abnormal to the society '' , but time has proved us how his madnees change the world .

Taking a look at these three examples we can see that persons who dare to make and to express ideas that lead to new things change our manners , costumes and even our way of thinking .

Many succeful people follow these lessons and teachings , and the consecuences are that their way of livining and ideas take places in our minds and thougths and we hope that we can introduce them in our life
