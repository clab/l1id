I desagree with this statement .

The cars are one of the most creative inventions of the human being that have contributed with the tranportation .
The invention of the car comes from a long time ago when someone discovered this new way of transporation that would change their lives forever .
And since then the human being has been trying to improve the car in all of its aspects .
Growing like a trained dog , following every step that the humanity take , satisfying their transportation needs .

Now cars are maybe the most succesfull way of transportation and people is not still satisfied with the last innovations of this cars , in fact they want more , they want better cars that can be able to satisfy their personal demands .

So now year with year there is more people born , people that then grow and develop new ideolgies and new demands for the car designers .
So with the time passing by , and the technology improving day by day future car designs are gonna be maybe 100 hundred times more succesfull than they are nowadays and still , people will be looking for new innovations .

In twenty years the scientists and car designers could be able to get these cars to the sky , and just imagine how many demands for this new cars are going to be made .
I 'm sure that some day there is not gonna be more space for this cars but I am also pretty sure that people are not gonna care for this , instead they are going to develop new ways to store them but never get rid of them .

I think that the cars have left a very big footprint in the heart of the humanity and its going to take a while for it to disappear .
They are gonna be used for a long time .
