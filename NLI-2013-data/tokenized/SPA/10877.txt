Risks in life

There is a diversity of people , and they all have diferent ways to see and to take life .
We have the ones that are `` laisy '' , that prefere to stay with their ouwn knoledge and continue life like as constant person .
But in the other side we have the `` active '' person , the one that are confortable on having new experience .
I think people have to be positive in life and while we are expose to new experience we need to asimilated and to deal with them taking risks and caring about your future .

On of the reason I agree with the the risky people , is because I am like that .
I am the person that never gives up during my new experience , maybe I use my experience from the pass to help myself guide and find a solution .
These kind of people have a lot to bring to the world because they are constanlly creating new things and new ways of seeing things .

Another rason of my agreement with the first statment , is because I imagine the future in the hands of people that infront life this way and it produces me something discusting .
I am not able to share with this kind of people because life is a game and you have to play with it and be positive with any obstacle that could infer you during your life and take it as a risk that you could manage having a mental health .

Finally , I will always be happy to meet risky people and to know that there is more people that take life as a risk than those who are afraid to confront life , this is why I am sure that sooner or later this kins of people are going to need help , because life is based on the future and there is no future with our new experiences .
