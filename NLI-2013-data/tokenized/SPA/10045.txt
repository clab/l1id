Sure , I think the successful people always take risk and try new things because they have high self - confidence , they believe on every idea that he or she is thinking and sacrify .
While other kind of persons keeps doing the same thing all the time because they fell save .

The successful person always see the world like a place to develop new projects , although maybe , these will not have the good result .
But there , is playing a specially situation , the self-confidence .
A success person not always have all the idea like a glass , because in this world there are a lot information .
But , They take or use all the information first , to develop things .
Maybe they will take much time to have the answer but one day , they can have a excellent project .

Second , if person believe that her or his idea is good , this person will finish it .
But one person that always play to keep save never have a new idea to follow .

Third , all these characteristics , after mentionate , are important but the sacrify is necesary , too .
One persona who does not have sacried something never will reach a subject in her or his life .
