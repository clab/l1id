Humans have been always against risky situations , but those who have abandoned their fears have , at least , succeed .
So , I think that the spirit of fighting against yourself is one of the most important qualities you could have .

First of all , if you do n't progress , you will be always at the same level , you wo n't reach for higher positions .
Unless , you are happy with this situation , this wo n't be a problem , but in my case this would be a disaster , because I always think the way of getting better until the perfection and I think that is the feeling that moves the world .
You only have to remember every morning that if it has n't been for Cristobal Columbus , that decided to take a new route to the West Indians , probably now we would be not learning English .

Second , if you get used to doing some process or task that everybody is able to do , then you became one of them .
But in the moment that appears somebody who could do it better than you , then you get replaced .
You are dismissed .
For example , if you work in a company that has just stablished in China , and you are the first who learn Chinese , then the next that come behind you , wo n't be able to pass through you .

And at last living the same kind of lifestyle could be very boring , in the sense that you sink into the routine and it becames very difficult for you to go on since you do n't have incentives .

To sum it up , riskless way of living is not permitted for me , because you have to be self confident of your possibilities and try to use them in the most efficient way in order to prevent yourself of the attack of the others and then you will reach your own limits .
