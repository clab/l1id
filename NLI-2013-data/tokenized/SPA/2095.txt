Definetly I agree with the idea that young people enjoy more life that older ones mainly because we get knowledge in an eassier way , we emphasize on the importance of the cooperation skill and in general because we have a better sense of humor .

Firstly , Young people assimilate the existing and new information efficiently .
We are like an empty box to which we add new ideas and conceptions .
For instance , we addecuate perfectly to the information age by the use of internet , i/pod or new devices .
Moreover we learn without much difficulty foreign languages like english , chinese or french .
Consequently , we enjoy the new benefits of this age .

Secondly , Young people like working on groups which is essential for developing the cooperation skill and fit better on this age .
Nowadays everybody is inter conected and the enviroment is more complex than before by the existence of more competidors therefore a team work is vital if we want to survive , moreover young are the ones who practice it perfectly because we do not find any differences among people or we do not have erronous conceptions from the past .
This skill let us make a lot of friends and enjoy much better our job and study hours .
Therefore we enjoy more our life .

Thirdly , Young people have a better sense of humor .
This skill let us find the possitive side of the things .
For instance I do not get too much depressed when things do not go well but my parents do , getting depressed many times .

To sum up , as far as I am concerned young people beacuse of their atitud to life like assimilating new ideas without any problem , having innate the cooperation skills or having a good sense of humor enjoy more life than older people .
