I think that is good to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects but it is better to specializain one specific subject .
My first reason is that when you are studying for your future , and for the work you would like to have in the future it is better to study something that you prefer the most .
If you want to be an accountant it is no very necesary for to study lot of subjects that wo n't be useful in your future , for example , history .
History is not a subject that an accountant would need in a future an accountant should study mathematics , or economy .
However , it is good to you increase your knowledge in different subjects but if you are trying to be an accountant I think that it is better to study the specific subjects htat an accountant need for the profession .

My second reason is that if you start to study lot of subjects of every kind then when you want to get a job it is very difficult to get one becuase you do n't know in what area you are better or in what area you want to work and this would be very bad because then you will have to study for an especific subject and you will lose more time to get a job and probably you will start to forget what you have learned before .

The last reason I have is that is probably very hard for someone to study lot of things when they are not very related .
Although I prefer to have a good knowledge in only one specific subject , I think that all the knowledge and things that people could study and know are very good to the life , because you do n't know in what moment you have to apply your knowledge , and when that moment arrives you will be able to use all your knowledges and the benefits can be greats .
