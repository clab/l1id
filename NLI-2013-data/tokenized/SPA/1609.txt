This statement is actually a question that people already do in this particular moment with more frecuency than in the past .
What is better in order to have a good job ? .
Is it better to known a variety of knowlegde ? .
Nobody has the thruth but many features are taking into account regardless to this matter .
I am disagree with the statement considering aspects such as academic position , type of themes or discipline that a person can choose and technology advances that has been make a significant impact in our way of see the reality and the society .

First , if we are talking about and undergraduate student is better to have a broader perspective of reality , in other terms a backgroung of knowlegde on many academic subject .
This would improve the ability to choose an specific area in which the student can do a master degree .
On the other hand , a graduate student of course would prefer an specialize career on an specific subject .

Second , for example a doctor will need a specialization because of the complexity of the human being and the advances that the Medicine has already made .
If a person go for a graduate in Sociology , she or he will need to know as much as they can to understand the people and the society that affect that people .
Moreover , Literature and Arts also need a widespread of knowledge to compare and contrast the variety of view points that imply every kind of art .

Finally , non of these arguments are out of the technology and the amazing boom that the world is living right now .
Because of the access to internet we can learn many academics subjects as well as to find and to specialize on a specific theme .

Nevertheless , these are point of view from one perception of the world , it depends on people to decide and follow in which direction will be more benefitial to go .
