i agree .

History has teach us that successful people take risks .
When people take risks they take the dificult path .
A more complex and difficult path its in front of them .
They are in front of the unknow .
The unknow its a very difficult path becuase people do not know what its going to hit them next .
Important is when the people accomplish the unknow and make a use of it , they become a successful man .

I want to become a successful man , and for that reason i need to take risks .
The risks that im going to take is to go away to a different country and study there .
A new world with out my famiy is going to shape my soul .
Im going to learn new things and take new risks .
I am trying to become a better man .
I am trying to become a better person , and that is success for me .
In the path of success there are many unknow traps .
I have to learn from the traps and use them in my future life .

I could stay in my house and do what i do well .
I know i can be a successful man doing what i know already WELL .
But i ca n't stay home and not try to accomplish my dreams .
I feel a successful person has to accomplish treir dreams and take new risks .
This is the second time i take the toefl exam .
I need 90 points and i got 89 .
do you thing im going to stop there .
No , i need to take risks and do the exam again and again until i pass .
A successful person is someone who acomplish what ever they are looking for .
When you want to accomplish something you have to take risks and do not stop ; you have to try new things and do not stop until you accomplish your dreams .

my dreams is to study in Sydney and im not going to stop taking risks until i accomplish that .
becouse that mekes me a successful man .
That is what successful people try new things .
i believe people have only one life and they have to take the best out of it .
For that reason there is a need of every successful man to take risks .

Thank you ,
