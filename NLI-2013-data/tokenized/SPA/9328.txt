Live is made of facts .
Those facts probbably came from good concepts and ideas that helped you to make those facts .
It ' very important to students to understand ideas and concepts , this will give them a good base for their lives .
Are our roots since the human started to think .

For example , is like when you go to College or university , first , you have to learn how mathematics works , design , engineering and other classes in order to learn how to make a car .
If you just listen to your teacher about how they built a car or how companies built their cars , you will have an small idea how that works , but it wont be as helpfull as understanding ideas will be .
A basic example might be : You do n't write an article unless you now how to write .

When you learn from facts you are learning from an external source and experience , and each person is different , moment are different , you do n't know what is behind that fact .
It could be totally unlikelly from what you have learned .
For example , cars again , europeans started building cars for their own geography and characteristics , they were totally different from the ones built in Asia , because they are in differents places .

There is a process in life , humans learn ideas and concepts , we cannot say that we do n't learn from facts , but whe need someone to teach us how the thinks works , which tools should we use , methods , organization , etc .
After that , we will start to see different facts , but with some information in our brains .
Thas is what makes the difference .

It is much eassier for a student understand ideas and concepts that learn from facts .
That is why we belive in education , that is why education is so important in this world , and continues growing every day .
Education is based on ideas and concepts , not on facts
