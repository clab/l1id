It has always been in debate whether having a broad knowledge of many academics subject is better than being specialize in one specific subject .
There have been many good reasons for both sides and in conclusion it is a only a matter of opinion .
In my opinion , I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many things than be specialized in one subject Firstly , if one has a broad knowledge of many things because one is more aware of his surroundings .
Know a little about a lot makes you more cultured since you can discuss and converse on different topics even if you are not specialized in one .
You also are not puzzled by simple questions that many specialized people would n't be able to answer outside their subject of knowledge .
If you are with a person that only knows about one subject , his field of conversation is much smaller than one that has some knowledge about many topics .

Secondly , being specialized in one subject never means that you know everything there is to know about the topic because there will always be questions .
Socrates said , `` I know that I know nothing '' .
Einstein also said that the more one knows , the more he understands the little knowledge he has .
These two great people in history are commenting on what is problemetic of specialized knowledge .
Once you dig deeper in a subject more problems will always apear .
Once you know one more fact in the sobject , two more questions will arise .

Finally , to have success in the future , at work or in life , one will eventually use more that the knowledge of one subject .
One will impliment the vast knowledge he has to solve the obstacles ahead of him .
Maybe you are a great mathematician but know nothing of psychology , you will have a hard time going through life with just being an expert in that subject .
Math will not help you when you are trying to raise a family or looking after children .
There must be a balance of esencial knowledge that people must have In my opinion , to be succesful in life and be able to handle the obstacles in it one must have an all-around knowledge of many esencial instruments that will be used later on .
You will sacrifice deep knowledge about subjects but gain much more in life .
Life does n't come in subjects , in comes in a whole .
Being prepared for the whole is the key .
