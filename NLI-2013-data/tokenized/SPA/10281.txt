I must say I agree with the statement .

There are some advantages I could point out for trying new things and taking risks , which are :

- People who try new things differentiate themselves from the rest and get recognition for that from their peers and eventually from opinion leaders or other people that might help them with their purposes .

- Taking risks is the same than doing things not on the easy way .
Because of that , it should become both a rewarding and educational experience .
It may help overcome fears , it can help to learn more about ourselves and our limits and it should leave the door open for not being afraid of trying new things in the future .

- It makes you discover your strenghts and weaknesses and how far you can push yourself into different situations , as opposed to keep doing the activity that you know you perform well which will not let you discover hidden talents that you may have .

Everytime I watch the news or read the newspaper and see a business success story , I tend to think that that 's something I could have done .
Then I realize that it all has to do with the guts people have to start doing something before the rest .
Taking risks is a key to success .

Altough I have summarized some possitive appreciations of taking risks there are considerations that should be taken into account before trying new things :

Doing something new or different may cause a negative effect or even rejection from the rest of the people .
Therefore , if you are thinking of doing something nobody else has ever done before , you need to think first of how society will react to that new thing and if it can affect or hurt anybody in anyway .

Taking risks may drive someone into frustration if what he/she had in mind was not successful .
Not all your goals will be achieved by taking risks , there needs to be more than goodwill put into a project such as study , research , commitment and effort .

I think the combination of hard work , commitment and taking risks leads to succesfull people .

Knowing yourself , your strenghts and what you already know you can do well helps , but you need to give a step further to succeed .
