It is a well-known fact that cars are one of the major causes of pollution nowadays .
However , will we give priority to the environment over our own good and comfort ?
On the one hand , there is a current growing awareness of the terrible risks that poses the pollution which has been generated throughout the last decades .
Knowledge about what is beneficial or , on the contrary , harmful for the society is increasingly being spread among both youngsters and adults by ecologists .

On the other hand , people living today will not be alive to see what the world becomes in a few centuries .
Therefore , they do not really seem to be affected by the issue .

Personally , I consider that twenty years is very little time to make people get used to going on foot to work or to using public transport .
We are still in the era of technology .
As long as new cars are invented , there is not way to stop people buying them .
In fact , the more the sellers offer , the more the customers demand .
Thus , the evironmental situation might even worsen by that time .
Let 's take my father .
He cannot avoid buying the last model in the market .
He is passionate of cars !

Despite the fact that we are aware of the threaten that this uncontrolled use of cars poses to our healths , people are likely to continue with their lives as if there is nothing outside there to worry about .

But people will soon realize that there is a real need to stop polluting .
Otherwise , pure air will totally disappear and we will not be able to breath .
Even though I do not think that two decades is enough time to concious people about this worrying issue , I believe that politicians will get to an agreement in which they will look for the population 's protection , since it is an issue which concerns us all .
For instance , a good measure to be taken would be to put a ban on driving a personal car more than twice a week .

From then and on , I am positive that people will think it twice wether to drive a car or to take the bus !
