Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ?
Or is it better to specialize in one specific subject ?
Tricky questions .
I would have to say that it depends , they both have their cons and pros .
For example , when you 're in high school , which is my case , you definitely should have knowledge of all the academic subjects that you need in order to graduate and pass on to your next step in life , which is college .
But once you get to college , for example , why would you need to know advanced math when you do n't want to study anything related to it ?
You would just be wasting your time and money .

Right now , I 'm required to know , at least a little , about everything , from ancient history to the meaning of the mathematical term pi .
But sometimes I find myself asking : will I ever use this again in my life ?
Why should I learn all these things if I do n't want to study anything related to it ?
But then there are some other times when , for example , my younger sister comes to me with a school problem and I can help her because I 've learned those things before .

Sometimes we can be very lazy and only learn what is presented to us at the moment .
But then there are the times when we want to know everything .
Like for example , when we are kids , that everything our mothers do we question them why .
Why this and why that , and there never seems to be an answer to all of a our questions .

Going back to the questions , a pro of knowing about different subjects is that you actually know about pretty much anything .
This makes it easier to have a conversation with another person and even to get a boyfriend .
A con is that maybe you 've spend way too much time doing your research and when you realize it a part of your life has gone by .
A pro of specializing in only one specific subjetc is that you can be better at what you do .
A con is that you wo n't have so many things to talk about with someone outside of what you do .

To summarize this entire thing , I definetely think that everyone should have knowledge of basic information and subjects and even read the newspaper , at least once in a while , and be educated , but have more knowledge on your field of study and that way you can be the best professional that you can be .
