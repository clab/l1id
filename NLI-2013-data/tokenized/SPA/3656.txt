Well I 'm not sure about this .
I think I agree because it looks obvious that nowadays , young people normally think more about theirselves , and do not really care about their communities , at least most of them .

They think it 's more interesting to do something that will give them a benefit at the moment , or soon , and for sure , than expending time in something that will give a small benefit to other people , and just maybe .

But I also think that this is changing .
Each day I can see more young people who care more about their community , and help , probably because their parents have a different mind than the parents of the young people before , and teach them in a different way that they have to help .
Everyday I can see , for example , that they recicle , they dont throw trash to the floor , they care about politics and discuss them , etc .
But I also think they are just habits , they dont really do it with the intention of helping the community .
So , it 's a good change because they help , but they still prefer to think more about theirselves .

I think that to make them really change and want to help their community , they have to be interested in it , so they take it as a personal benefit .
To make this , the community should organize interesting excursions for young people who help the community , or some kind of grant .
This way i 'm sure that they will spend much more time in helping the community , while getting also benefits .

So my conclusion is that I agree and also that if we want to change this , the community should change in some way too .
