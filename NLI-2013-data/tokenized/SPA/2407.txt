I think that younger people do indeed enjoy life more than older people .
In my opinion younger people are supposed to have more fun because they have less responsabilities and do not have to worry as much about problems that come with adulthood , such as money , jobs and family .

I am 17 and I can remember just a few years back when I was 15 , how different my life was .
I did n't have to work , my school works was much less of a burden and I did n't have to worry as much about my future .
Now , only a few years later I realized that my life has changed completly because I now work and at the same time I need to keep my gradees up so that I can get into college .
I realize that from 15 to 17 is not really growing up , and that being a 17 year old is not considerd being an elder , but what Im trying to say that with age comes more and more responsibilty .

Now that I 'm older I see how much time and effort my mom puts in to making my sister and I happy .
My mom constantly looks for work , so that she can make money .
She always has to make sure that my sister 's and my every need is being taken care of .
Sometimes I feel like she might forget about herself .
As my mother works hard like this day after day all I worry about is my school work , my job and what Im going to do next friday .
All I worry about is things for me , while my mom worries about my sister , myself , my animals , my home , her job , her self and many other things .
She has got to make sure that everything is running smoothly .
I cant imagine being her and having to do all those things .
I sometimes wonder , does she ever have fun ?
Does she ever go out ?
The reality is that she does but when she tells me stories about when she was younger she always syas `` ahhh ...
those were the good times . ''
Each time she says that I realize that being an adult can be hard work .

Because I 'm still young I still get to do many fun things , but as I get older peopel around me expect more and more from me and those expectations mean , to act mature and be responsible .
Surely , as I get older I have noticed that my priorities have changed .
I look at my sister , who is a freshman in high school , and see how different we are .
She worries very much about what she wares and what she looks like , while I'de rather worry about getting to school or passing my physics test .
I asked my mom if I was like that and she said `` we all go through it , we all mature ...
its part of adulthood . ''
We all at some point of our lives stop having the same fun as we had as a child .
Look at babies all they do is sleep and eat , while parents wish they could get some sleep or even loose a couple of pounds .

In the end I trully believe that younger people enjoy life much more than older people because they have less ressponsibilities and less things to worry about .
Although throughout your life you are longer an adult than you are a child , you will always remember `` those good old days '' because they are a reminder of when you where care-free and had nothing to worry about .
